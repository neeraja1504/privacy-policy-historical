**The Short Awesome Version:  **
Akiwood.com is an awesome website that does not steal or harvest any of your information.  The site is safe, and any place you are going to buy anything is secure.  The only way you will get on a mailing list from Akiwood.com is if you fill in one of the opt in forms.  If you want out, just unsubscribe at any time, there will always be a link at the bottom of the list emails for you to do that…
…In other words, there is never a reason to be a butt-hole and report spam over a list that YOU subscribed to. Simply click the unsubscribe button.
Obviously, this is a for profit site that promotes home business opportunities and making money from home.  If you are one of those butt-monkeys that think everything is a pyramid scheme, I have 2 things to say to you:
I feel sorry for you(and you need some education, Click Here to get it)
You will probably enjoy another website more, so just leave now; thank you for stopping by!
If you want the full privacy policy, continue reading below, the Disclaimer is on another page.  We recommend that you buy everything we are selling because it just feels good to buy stuff.
