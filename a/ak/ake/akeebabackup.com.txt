AkeebaBackup.com is committed to protecting you and your personal information when you are using our services. We want our services to safe and enjoyable environments for our users. This Privacy Policy is relevant to our use of any personal information you provide to us during your visit to our site.
AkeebaBackup.com seeks to follow the industry's best practices concerning personal information handling.
The website contains hyperlinks to external resources, hosted and operated by third parties. These parties have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them carefully. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the handling of your personal information when visiting these external resources; your use of those third party resources and/or websites is your own responsibility.
We also use third-party service and content providers (such as Google AdSense, Google Analytics and Disqus) who may collect their own set of personal information. Since these are third parties, the information collected by them is not governed by this Privacy Statement. Take a look at the Cookies section towards the bottom of this document for more information.

We record your IP address as part of the unconditional logging our web server software does whenever anybody accesses our site.

to contact you regarding new content added on our website, e.g. new forum posts, if you have opted in for this sort of communication;
