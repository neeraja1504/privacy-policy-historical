YOUR PRIVACY RIGHT
You have the right to request from companies conducting business your country, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an "Opt-outâ€ or "Opt-inâ€ choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
Akazoo qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either decline to permit ("Opt-out") or consent to ("Opt-in") the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
If you request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at Akazoo.com or you may contact us via postal mail at:

If you wish to Opt-out of a Co-Branded Partnerâ€™s future use of your Personal Information, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly.
We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining our Services and our operations. These third party specialists that provide support to our Services, Website and Content are our "operational service providersâ€ and we use them to efficiently provide the full range of Content, subscription plans, services, promotions, advertising, downloading, streaming and other features and functions we offer or make available to you. We request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with our Services although we are not responsible for their failure to do so. Additionally, these operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances:
When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);
If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, our Community Requirements or any Additional Terms or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Services, any of our operational service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users, registered users, Subscribers or any other party;
If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or
In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us.
Security and Protection of Personal Information. We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites and wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Services by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy although we are not responsible for their failure to do so.
Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information. Generally, you may review, update or delete any of your Personal Information collected by or through our Service, as well as your profile or any other user information you may have entered during the registration and/or subscription process or your participation in our Services or any prior updates you may have given us. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age or wireless or mobile device numbers, may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Services, your status as a Registered User, Subscriber and/or other aspects of our Service or offers we make available to you. If you have registered for or subscribed to any Services or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Service, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.

We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, subscription, status as a Registered User, Subscriber, and/or the use of or access to any or all of our Services and any other services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Service, to use or access any information or to use a User ID. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information.
