What are the purposes of the processing?
Agisoft is developing stand-alone software (such as Agisoft Metashape). In order to
licence the software and/or use related services, you have to conclude a contract with
Agisoft. Therefore, Agisoft processes your personal data for the performance of the
contract and in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract. Agisoft collects your
identification data, contact data, product related information and payment details in order
to provide you the software and related services (for example customer support).
Furthermore, the processing might be necessary for compliance with legal obligations to
which Agisoft is subject. For example, Agisoft is required to organise the accounting and
financial reporting.
Agisoft will also process your personal data if the processing is necessary for the
purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Agisoft. In every such case Agisoft will
consider whether such interests might be overridden by the interests or fundamental
rights and freedoms of you as a data subject. For example, Agisoft has the legitimate
interest to process your data to help with fraud identification and prevention.
Agisoft can process your personal data if you have given consent to the processing of
your personal data for one or more specific purposes. For example, you can choose
whether you send to Agisoft the Software error related data or not. You have the right to
withdraw your consent at any time. However, we remind you that the withdrawal of
consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
withdrawal.
Where we store and process personal data?
Agisoft’s headquarters are located in 11 Degtyarniy per., St. Petersburg, Russia. Agisoft
retains most of the data on a password protected server on local network (no access
from Internet). When the data is transferred to us, we implement appropriate safeguards
and means. We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable
information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to
protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.
We always will carefully assess all the circumstances and make sure appropriate
safeguards are put in place so that your rights are not in any way undermined. We make
sure that conditions to enforce your rights and effective legal remedies are available.
Agisoft may use data processors and in such case some of the data may be stored in
their servers. Agisoft uses only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will
meet the requirements of this Policy and ensure the protection of the rights of the data
subject. For example, if you use our cloud processing service, your data will be stored in
Amazon’s servers (you can review Amazon Web Services’ Privacy Policy here). If you
use customer support, all related information is stored by Freshworks Inc (you can
review Freshworks Privacy Policy here). Please also see Section 6 of the Policy for more
information about processors. If you need more detailed information about processing by
processors carried out on behalf of Agisoft, please contact us.
5. How long do we retain your personal data?
Agisoft has both the right and the obligation to retain the personal data collected for a
period of time. Agisoft does not retain personal information longer than necessary to
achieve the purposes of processing and comply with the obligations of Agisoft. However,
Agisoft may retain the personal data for a longer period of time if you have given consent
for longer storage and processing of the data.

personal information data that is related to the license (name, contact details, licence
number, etc.) as long as the licence is valid.

continues to support its users after the guaranteed support period as well. However,
Agisoft reserves the right to review its support policy with respect to the after-one-year
period at its sole discretion without prior notice to the user. As a general rule Agisoft will
retain the data collected during support period until the user contacts Agisoft via e-mail
with request to erase their data.
If Agisoft sends personal information to another controller, the data retention periods are
determined by the recipient of the data.
6. To whom and why we transfer your personal data?
Agisoft discloses personal information only to the extent and in the form necessary for
the fulfilment of the purposes listed in the Privacy Policy.
Agisoft may transfer your personal data to other data controllers or processors. Agisoft

example BrightMarket LLC dba FastSpring – online shop; Freshworks Inc, Freshdesk –
support desk system; Yandex LLC – Yandex.Mail e-mail accounts, Infobox – web site
hosting (forum with its user database)). These companies may need information about
you in order to perform their functions. Data processors are not authorized to use the
shared data for any other purpose.
