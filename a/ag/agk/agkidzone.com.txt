INFORMATION THE SITE COLLECTS
Information Collected. This section describes the Personal Information and Other Information the Site collects from visitors.
Personal Information. Personal Information is information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally ( for example , first and last name, mailing address or telephone number). Personal Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier that is associated, on a persistent or on-going basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access the Site (Device Identifier). The Site does not generally collect name, address, or other contact information from visitors who play games or participate in other activities on the Site. However, we and our third-party service providers may collect your Device Identifier when you visit the Site. We, and our third party service providers, use this information solely to support the Site’s internal operations, including maintaining, securing, and analyzing the functioning of the Site and serving contextual advertisements.
The Site may also, on limited occasions, collect first name and online contact information (typically, an e-mail address) from Children solely for the following purposes:
For one-time use of that information, such as to respond directly to a specific request (for example, answering a question submitted through the Site). We delete the contact information provided from our records once it is used to fulfill the specific one-time purpose and will not use it to re-contact the Child.
For the sole purpose of any of the following: to protect the security or integrity of the Site; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; and, to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.
If the Site offers a feature that collects Personal Information in addition to the information described above, we will, where required by COPPA, provide the Child’s Parent prior notice of the Site’s privacy practices and obtain the Parent’s consent before collecting the Child’s Personal Information. If you believe your Child is participating in an activity that collects Personal Information and you or another Parent have not received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please contact us. We will not use Parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the Parent, unless the Parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.
Please note that, as required by law, we will not condition a Child’s participation in an activity on the Site on the Child’s disclosing more than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. We use Personal Information only for the purpose that it was provided and for internal purposes, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Public Disclosure
The Site does not enable Children to make Personal Information publicly available.
Ongoing Communications
We may collect a Child’s email address in order to communicate with that Child more than once, such as for providing a newsletter. For such purposes, we will retain the Child’s email address solely for such communication purposes and for no other reason. Whenever we collect a Child’s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a Parent email address in order to notify the Parent about the collection and use of the Child’s information, as well as to provide the Parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the Child.
Parental Consent
In the event we wish to collect Personal Information from a Child, COPPA requires that we first seek a Parent’s consent by email. In the email we will explain what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the Parent can provide consent, and how the Parent can revoke consent. If we receive confirmation via email from the Parent, we will take an additional step to confirm the Parent’s consent, which may be to contact the Parent again via email or by phone, fax, or mail. A Parent may consent to Cloudco collecting certain Personal Information about a Child, but not consent to disclosing that Personal Information to a third party. If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the Parent contact information and any other information collected from the Child in connection with that activity.
