Agoda Privacy Policy
Agoda Privacy Policy
Introduction
Last Updated in October 2017
Agoda.com is owned and operated by Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. ("Agoda" or "we"), a company registered in Singapore. The following Privacy Policy describes how we as a data controller collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personally identifiable information that we collect about individuals ("Personal Data") in connection with the services available from Agoda through the website located at www.agoda.com ("Site"). References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to mobile websites and applications. By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
On occasion, Agoda may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Agoda will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change. If you do not agree with any changes or modifications to the Privacy Policy, please do not continue using the Site. You will be deemed to have consented to any modification of the Privacy Policy when you use the Site after the effective date of the modification.
Information We Collect
We collect Personal Data about you that you provide to us when using the Site. Personal Data may include your name, address, phone number, credit card details, e-mail address, accommodation name, accommodation location and/or length of stay. In addition to this, when using our Site, even if you do not make a reservation, we may collect other certain information, such as your IP address, geographic data, your nationality and password, search preferences related to specific searches, which browser you’re using, and information about your computer’s operating system, application version, language settings and pages that have been shown to you. If you are using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics and latitude/longitude details, and if you participate in an Agoda program there may be limited additional data that we may collect from the accommodation about your stay, for example, a list of charges (anonymized) as part of the Agoda Reception program. When you make a reservation, our system registers through which means and from which websites you have made your reservation.
Pre-reservation chat support: in certain circumstances we may provide Agoda customers with pre-reservation chat support. The purpose of this support is to help customers with any pre-reservation questions that they may have but should a customer decide to proceed with the reservation on the Site, the customer will be expected to follow the normal reservation procedure him or herself. As such, we will generally not ask customers for any Personal Data e.g. no credit card numbers or customer email addresses but in case any information a customer provides to Agoda is deemed by law to be Personal Data or if the customer decides to disclose Personal Data to Agoda or where such Personal Data is required to be collected in order to provide pre-reservation chat support, then this Privacy Policy will apply to such Personal Data collected.
Protecting Your Personal Data
To prevent unauthorized access, we maintain reasonable physical, electronic and organizational procedures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. To protect credit card transactions, Agoda.com currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt credit card information during transit.
How We Use the Information We Collect– Credit Card on File
i) General Use: We use Personal Data and other information collected through the Site to (a) register you with the Site and create your user account, (b) provide you with the requested services (mainly to process and confirm your reservation with the accommodation provider or other supplier) after verifying your credentials, (c) provide you with information about our services on the Site or on other websites and to communicate with you (including by post-booking chat support) to the extent necessary to provide such requested services, (d) build features that will make the services available on the Site easier to use, (e) conduct surveys, (f) for an improved user experience, internal training and general optimization purposes, (g) for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities or (h) contact you in case there is any issue with your booking. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers.
ii) Marketing Activities & Reminders: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law. For example:
When you make a reservation with us, set up a user account, complete or enter details into a booking form, or provide us with your contact details we may use your contact information to send you news of products and services relevant and useful for travellers. With your consent – if consent is required under local law – we may also send you other regular newsletters by email. You can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communications at any time using the "Unsubscribe" link in each newsletter or communication, or you can administer your subscriptions through your account (if you've created one).
Based on the information you share with us, individualized offers may be shown to you on the Site, in mobile apps or on third-party websites, including social media sites. These might be offers that you can book directly on the Site, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
If you have not finalized a reservation online, we may send you a reminder to continue with your reservation. We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodation again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.
Please see the section below titled “Cookies, Page Tags and Data Use” on how we use this data for advertising purposes.
Please note that the confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking, as well as the guest review emails sent after your departure, are not marketing messages. These messages are part of your accommodation reservation process. Respectively, they contain information for you to check in at your booked accommodation, and tools to optionally rate that accommodation after your stay. You will continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our marketing messages. Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us. If you elect to receive Price Alerts, you will be able to opt out of receiving the same by clicking on the “turn off price alerts” or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you.
iii) Credit Card on File: When logging in, you will have the ability to save credit card details to your personal account for faster future bookings and payments. Your card details are always secure using strong encryption and you can always log in to your personal account to delete, edit or add certain credit card details. For security reasons, the number cannot be edited (but the card details can be deleted). When viewing card details, only the last 4 digits of the number will be visible. Please note that we will store the last 4 digits of your credit card securely upon any booking made (this is required to manage any refund requests for that booking).
Sharing Your Personal Data
Agoda may share your Personal Data with suppliers such as accommodation properties, third party accommodation suppliers like Booking.com and other third parties we appoint to perform services on our behalf, such as third party loyalty programs, web hosting, data analysis, marketing (also on websites of such third parties), customer care, credit card and payment services and related services. If you are enrolled in the Agoda Reception program as detailed in Terms of Use, Agoda may share your credit card data that you may have on file with Agoda with the property you have booked at but only to the extent necessary to allow the functioning of the Agoda Reception program and the charging by the accommodation for charges incurred by you at the relevant property. All such third parties will be under an obligation to maintain the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data, and to process the Personal Data only in accordance with our instructions.
As mentioned in our Terms of Use and in order for Agoda to offer the best in class inventory to customers, Agoda may source accommodation from third party accommodation suppliers and as a result Agoda may share your Personal Data with such third party accommodation suppliers which may include other entities within the Priceline Group of companies e.g. Booking.com but only to the extent necessary to ensure that your Agoda reservation is reserved with the relevant accommodation. Further, and for the same purposes, such third party accommodation suppliers may also share your Personal Data to the same extent with the relevant accommodation that it has contracted with directly. In such case Agoda will continue to provide you with reservation and other support services in respect of such accommodation that you have reserved on an Agoda platform.
In some cases, Agoda may require that you transact directly with a third party to obtain services, or when you use the Site to reserve an accommodation room or obtain another service (such as points under a third-party loyalty program), we may provide your Personal Data to that accommodation property or other involved third party.
Agoda may propose other services (typically “add-ons”) to help plan your trip, to offer certain benefits (e.g. get points for third party loyalty or mileage programs) or for another purpose that may interest you. These services are offered by third party providers. As stated above, relevant data about this service may be shared with such third party providers to ensure optimal service.
Business partners: We work with many business partners around the world. Some of these business partners distribute or advertise our services, as well as help our other business partners distribute and advertise their own travel-related services. These business partners may also include the Priceline corporate group, a group which includes agoda.com. This may mean that their services are integrated into our website/apps, they have been enabled to show you a customized advertisement, or the agoda.com online reservation services are integrated in their websites and/or apps.
When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, certain personal data that you give them will be forwarded to us. If customer service is provided by the business partner, agoda.com will share details relevant to your reservation with the business partners (as and when needed) in order to provide you with appropriate and efficient support. When you make a reservation through one of our business partners’ websites, the business partners may receive certain parts of your personal data related to the specific reservation. This is for their own internal purposes (such as analytical purposes) and, if requested by you, for the administration of loyalty programs or marketing.
When you make a reservation on a business partners’ website, please also take the time to read their privacy policies if you wish to understand how these business partners may process your personal data. When we offer you other travel-related products and/or services, your information may be shared with the offering business partners to handle or administer your request. For fraud detection and prevention purposes and as strictly necessary, we may also exchange information about our users with business partners.
Save for disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy or as required or permitted by law in any relevant jurisdiction as mentioned below and the disclosure of your Personal Data and information required for completing your booking with the relevant accommodation of your choice and the sharing of certain Personal Data with selected partners where relevant (your details will be used for reporting and analysis purposes only), we will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties without your consent. However, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to our affiliated (group) companies (in and outside your home country), including our affiliated (group) companies' employees and our trusted agents and representatives who have access to this information with our permission and who need to know or have access to this information to perform the service requested by you (including customer services) and internal (audit/compliance) investigations.
Agoda may, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to protect ourselves against liability, to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, legitimate requests, warrants or equivalent by law enforcement officials or authorities, to investigate fraud or other wrongdoing or as otherwise required or necessary in order to comply with applicable law, protect our legitimate interests or to the purchasers in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business or company. We may also, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our services or to protect the rights, property or safety of Agoda, our users or others.
In the situations described above, the recipient of the Personal Data may be located in a jurisdiction that may have different standards of data protection compared to the laws in your home jurisdiction.
