Agoda Privacy Policy
Introduction
Last Updated on 14 August 2015
Agoda.com is owned and operated by Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. ("Agoda" or "we"), a company registered in Singapore. The following Privacy Policy describes how we as a data controller collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personally identifiable information that we collect about individuals ("Personal Data") in connection with the services available from Agoda through the website located at www.agoda.com ("Site"). References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to mobile websites and applications. By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
On occasion, Agoda may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Agoda will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change. If you do not agree with any changes or modifications to the Privacy Policy, please do not continue using the Site. You will be deemed to have consented to any modification of the Privacy Policy when you use the Site after the effective date of the modification.
Information We Collect
We collect Personal Data about you that you provide to us when using the Site. Personal Data may include your name, address, phone number, credit card details, e-mail address, hotel name, hotel location and/or length of stay. We also collect non-personally identifiable information, which may be linked to your Personal Data, including your log-in name, IP address, geographic data, operating system type, nationality and password, and search preferences related to specific searches, as well as other generic Internet usage related data.
Protecting Your Personal Data
To prevent unauthorized access, we maintain reasonable physical, electronic and organizational procedures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. To protect credit card transactions, Agoda.com currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt credit card information during transit.
How We Use the Information We Collect– Credit Card on File
We use Personal Data and other information collected through the Site (a) to register you with the Site and create your user account, (b) to provide you with the requested services (mainly to process and confirm your reservation with the accommodation) after verifying your credentials, (c) to provide you with information about our services on the Site or on other websites and to communicate with you to the extent necessary to provide such requested services, (d) to build features that will make the services available on the Site easier to use and (e) for an improved user experience and general optimization purposes or (f) to contact you in case there is any issue with your booking. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers. From time to time, Agoda may contact you to request feedback on your experience in using the Site, to assist us in improving the Site, to send newsletters or to offer special savings or promotions to you as a Site user, where you have indicated your consent to receiving such communications. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions or related marketing messages, you may simply opt out (“unsubscribe”) from receiving those by replying to Agoda using the hyperlink provided in these notices at any time. The confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking and the guest review emails sent after your departure respectively are not marketing messages as these are part of your accommodation reservation process. These allow you to check in at and rate the property after your stay if you wish to do so. You will continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our marketing messages. The guest review is completely optional, but will help other customers make an informed decision. When logging in, you will have the ability to save credit card details to your personal account for faster future bookings and payments. Your card details are always secure using strong encryption and you can always log in to your personal account to delete, edit or add certain credit card details. For security reasons, the number cannot be edited (but the card details can be deleted). When viewing card details, only the last 4 digits of the number will be visible. Please note that we will store the last 4 digits of your credit card securely upon any booking made (this is required to manage any refund requests for that booking).
Sharing Your Personal Data
Agoda may share your Personal Data with suppliers such as accommodation properties and other third parties we appoint to perform services on our behalf, such as third party loyalty programs, web hosting, data analysis, marketing (also on websites of such third parties), customer care, credit card and payment services and related services. All such third parties will be under an obligation to maintain the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data, and to process the Personal Data only in accordance with our instructions.
In some cases, Agoda may require that you transact directly with a third party to obtain services, or when you use the Site to reserve an accommodation room or obtain another product or service (such as points under a third-party loyalty program), we may provide your Personal Data to that accommodation property or other involved third party.
Agoda may propose other services (typically “add-ons”) to help plan your trip, to offer certain benefits (e.g. get points for third party loyalty or mileage programs) or for another purpose that may interest you. These services are offered by third party providers. As stated above, relevant data about this service may be shared with such third party providers to ensure optimal service.
Save for disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy or as required or permitted by law in any relevant jurisdiction as mentioned below and the disclosure of your Personal Data and information required for completing your booking with the relevant hotel of your choice and the sharing of certain Personal Data with selected partners where relevant (your details will be used for reporting and analysis purposes only), we will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties without your consent. However, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to our affiliated (group) companies (in and outside your home country), including our affiliated (group) companies' employees and our trusted agents and representatives who have access to this information with our permission and who need to know or have access to this information to perform the service requested by you (including customer services) and internal (audit/compliance) investigations.
Agoda may, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to protect ourselves against liability, to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, legitimate requests, warrants or equivalent by law enforcement officials or authorities, to investigate fraud or other wrongdoing or as otherwise required or necessary in order to comply with applicable law, protect our legitimate interests or to the purchasers in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business or company. We may also, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products or to protect the rights, property or safety of Agoda, our users or others.
In the situations described above, the recipient of the Personal Data may be located in a jurisdiction that may have different standards of data protection compared to the laws in your home jurisdiction.

Third Party Cookies and Page Tags
Our third party advertising companies may place cookies or page tags on some of the pages you visit on the Site.
