Privacy Policy
We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping confidential any personal information you share with us. Please read this privacy policy statement carefully. It covers the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that we collect about individuals through this website. This statement does not apply to those of our websites or portions of our websites that do not display or link to this privacy policy statement or that have their own privacy policy statement.
We reserve the right to update this statement at any time and in any manner. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the revised policy to the applicable websites. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to be informed of our privacy practices. At any time, the currently-posted statement shall govern.
Why do we collect information?
We collect your information because it enables us to give you, and our other customers, convenient access to certain features and services. It also enables us to verify your identity in our interactions with you, provide you with a consistent and personalized experience, and deliver a superior level of customer service. For example, to access certain of our features, services, and other non-public areas of our website, you will be asked to sign in with a login name and password. If you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you will not be able to access such non-public areas because we cannot verify your identity. Your information also helps us keep you posted on status updates, reminders, confirmations, and special offers, and events that may interest you.
What is “personal information”?
For purposes of this statement, "personal information" includes private information collected by us that may be used to uniquely identify an individual. Personal information does not include any public information about an individual that is available through federal, state, or local public records. It also does not include any information that, by itself, does not uniquely identify an individual, such as raw data aggregated across many individuals.
Collecting and Using Information.
Unless we say otherwise when collecting such information, we will use any personal information you provide to us in accordance with the terms of this statement. We will collect, use, and retain your personal information only to the extent reasonably necessary, and for the purposes we describe to you in this statement or elsewhere. Such purposes include in connection with our provision of requested services to you and our other customers, and the operation and administration of this website.
We may combine information we collect about you from this website with information we obtain about you from other sources, including aggregate data from third parties. For purposes of research and analysis, we may also aggregate personal and other information about you with information about our other customers. You agree to such use and agree that we will retain complete ownership and control over any aggregate data that we compile or acquire.
Further, you also agree that we may use your information to communicate status updates, reminders, confirmations, and other messages to you related to your purchase of our products and services, or use of the features and services on our websites. We may also use your information, where we have obtained your permission to do so, to communicate special offers and promotions from us, our affiliates, and our marketing partners that may interest you.
Sometimes we hire other companies to provide products and services to you on our behalf, such as processing transactions, hosting websites, conducting customer surveys, and providing customer service. We may share some of your personal information with these companies to enable them to perform such work. These companies are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose and are required to maintain its confidentiality.
We may also share your personal information with our parent and affiliated companies for their use in compliance with this statement. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties where we have obtained your permission to do so and where we are required or permitted to do so by law. We will not sell your personal information to third parties without your prior permission.
