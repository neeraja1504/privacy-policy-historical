Security and privacy
This is our Privacy Statement. It explains how this site obtains, uses and keeps safe information about you. We’re committed to keeping your personal information safe and confidential both online and offline.
This Privacy Statement is not designed to form a legally binding contract between Abbey and users of our website or online services. It is a guide towards our online protection standards, but of course it is of utmost importance to abide by the principles stated here.
Online application
If you apply for an account online, before you enter any personal details into the online form, we’ll tell you how your information will be used in our data protection statement and in the relevant terms and conditions. You will be asked to confirm that you have read and understood these before your application can proceed.
We might occasionally send you information about accounts and services which we think would be of interest to you. If you’d prefer us not to use your contact details in this way you can opt out by leaving the tick box that is available to you unticked.
Contacting us
Contacting us by phone
You can call our customer services team on 0845 6070 666. For your convenience, we also operate a call-back service – accessed via www.anbusiness.com. You give your number over the Internet and we’ll call you back on your normal telephone line. These calls are not made across the Internet. We’ll store your details on systems that aren’t connected to the Internet – although to help us improve our service we might record or monitor phone calls.
Contacting us by email
When you email us, we collect some personal details like your name, address and phone numbers. Email isn’t 100% secure - so we advise that you keep personal information to a minimum. With this in mind, don’t transmit account information using email.
Emails are stored on our standard internal contact systems which are secure and can’t be accessed by external parties. We store this information for an indefinite period of time in order to identify trends.
Using our calculators, decision tools, guides and budget planners
To use our range of calculators, tools, guides and budget planners, you’ll have to give us details of your financial situation and needs. The information we ask for will depend on what type of product or account you’re interested in.
But please remember: When you use a calculator, guide, decision tool or budget planner all of the details you provide are anonymous – and once you leave we never store your details, unless for example, you decide to save a quote.
Surveys and competitions
We’ll treat any survey or competition information you provide with the same high standard of care as we do all other customer information, using any details provided strictly within the terms of the competition and this Privacy Statement.
Sharedealing
Within Abbey Sharedealing you can research information on UK listed companies and AIM shares listed on the London Stock Exchange. You do it anonymously, and we’re not able to identify you as an individual from your research. Please note: our online sharedealing service is provided by Abbey Stockbrokers Limited (“ASL”). ASL is part of the Abbey group of companies.
