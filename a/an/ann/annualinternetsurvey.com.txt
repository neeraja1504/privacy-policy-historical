This policy applies to AnnualInternetSurvey.com's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by AnnualInternetSurvey.com on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to AnnualInternetSurvey.com's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. AnnualInternetSurvey.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
AnnualInternetSurvey.com collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an AnnualInternetSurvey.com survey, order form, or a registration page ("Jobseeker" account) either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, AnnualInternetSurvey.com or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to AnnualInternetSurvey.com, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). AnnualInternetSurvey.com may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to AnnualInternetSurvey.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from AnnualInternetSurvey.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to AnnualInternetSurvey.com.
1.2 Third Party List Information.
AnnualInternetSurvey.com collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and AnnualInternetSurvey.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, AnnualInternetSurvey.com seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to AnnualInternetSurvey.com and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when AnnualInternetSurvey.com obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by AnnualInternetSurvey.com or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through AnnualInternetSurvey.com's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a AnnualInternetSurvey.com service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
AnnualInternetSurvey.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, AnnualInternetSurvey.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows AnnualInternetSurvey.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in AnnualInternetSurvey.com's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.org. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows AnnualInternetSurvey.com to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, AnnualInternetSurvey.com might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in AnnualInternetSurvey.com's database, visits the fishing website, AnnualInternetSurvey.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and AnnualInternetSurvey.com would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. AnnualInternetSurvey.com may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, AnnualInternetSurvey.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in AnnualInternetSurvey.com's database.
(c) New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is AnnualInternetSurvey.com's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, AnnualInternetSurvey.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

If AnnualInternetSurvey.com obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, AnnualInternetSurvey.com has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. AnnualInternetSurvey.com has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
1.8 Credit Card Information.
AnnualInternetSurvey.com may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from AnnualInternetSurvey.com.
