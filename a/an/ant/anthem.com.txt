Privacy Authorization Forms
Anthem is fully committed to the spirit and letter of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), including but not limited to the Privacy Rule that was issued pursuant to HIPAA. A major provision of the Privacy Rule is to safeguard sensitive, personal information about members. This information is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI), and includes individually identifiable health care and demographic data.
HIPAA allows Anthem to use and disclose certain member information for clearly defined treatment, payment and health care operations (TPO). However, members have the right to restrict the release of information about them beyond these uses. The Individual Authorization Form provides the means for members to identify who can see their PHI and what specific PHI can be seen for purposes other than TPO. If you need to have your PHI disclosed to someone outside of Anthem for purposes other than TPO, complete the form and submit it to your local Anthem office. This address is located on the back of your Anthem identification card. If you have questions, please contact your local customer service unit. The telephone number is on the back of your identification card.
If you do not have an Anthem identification card, please contact us at 317-488-6000.

Your privacy is very important to us and we will make every reasonable effort to safeguard any information we collect.
What information will we collect?
Information may be collected in the following ways on this website:
If we provide user account access, you may elect to establish an account so that you can gain additional access to on-line service applications, health tools, health information, subscriptions or other services where it is important for us to know who you are in order to best meet your needs. Providing personal information is always voluntary.
We may use “cookies” to help us improve this website by tracking your navigation habits and to store some of your preferences. A cookie is a small file created by a website to store information on your computer. Cookies do not allow websites to gain access to other information on your computer. Once a cookie is saved on your computer, generally only the website that created the cookie can read it.
An Internet Protocol address is a number that automatically identifies the computer or mobile device that you are using to access the Internet. The IP address enables our server to send you the site pages that you want to visit or the data you want to view. The IP address may disclose the server owned by your Internet service provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to support our site administration.
How will information be used?
Any personal information that you provide is used for the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you use location services to find a provider near your current location, your location is used only to facilitate that function. We may also gather quantitative user information, such as the number of users and the pages or data accessed, in order to perform administrative, technical, hosting or other functions that help us manage our website and deliver new functionality to you.

Health Information Exchanges
We may share your information with health information exchanges. Electronic health information exchanges allow health care providers to view and share your health information quickly and easily — for treatment, payment or health care operations.
Health information exchanges can improve the speed, quality, safety and cost of your care. It’s also a great way to help make sure you get the right medication, and you don’t get the same tests more than once if you don’t need to. Doctors, health insurers and others using an exchange like this are required to follow the privacy and security standards set by U. S. and state laws.
California. In California, we’re taking part in a health information exchange called Cal INDEX. If you’re a member living in California, you’re automatically enrolled. Only participating doctors who are treating you will have access to your health records. If you or your dependents do not wish to have your health information made available on Cal INDEX, please fill out the online form at www.calindex.org/opt-out. Or you can call Cal INDEX at 1-888-510-7142.
