You can visit our website without disclosing any personal information. We store only the access data in server log files such as the names of the files requested, the date and time of the query, the data volumes transferred, browser type, IP-address, and the requesting provider. These data are evaluated exclusively to ensure trouble-free operation of the site and to improve our offer, but do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the person behind the user. In the case of concrete indications of unlawful use, we reserve the right to review the data retrospectively.

A comparison of the data collected with data, which may be collected by other components of our site, is also not made.

This approach virtually eliminates the misuse of your data.
