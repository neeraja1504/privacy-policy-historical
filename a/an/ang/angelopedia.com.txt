Cookies
To improve the responsiveness of our website for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via our website though your computer/laptop/notebook or mobile/tablet/pad/handheld device etc.
Most browser software can be set up to deal with cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly, and you may be unable to use some services that require registration in order to participate, or you will have to re-register each time you visit our site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.
Log File Information
We automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our website. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data - such as the pages you view. We automatically receive and log information from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection speed. We may also collect log information from your device, including your location, IP address, your device's name, device's serial number or unique identification number (e.g.. UDiD on your iOS device), your device operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection speed etc.
Clear GIFs
We may use "clear GIFs" (Web Beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our users in a anonymous manner, without personally identifying the user. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. We use this information to inter-alia deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our website to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our website to improve the website quality, functionality and interactivity and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.
Third Party Tools
We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of our website. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.
Google Analytics specifically has been enabled to support display advertising towards helping us gain understanding of our users' Demographics and Interests. The reports are anonymous and cannot be associated with any individual personally identifiable information that you may have shared with us. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings options provided by Google. You can opt out from Google Analytics by visiting this link - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Opting Out
From time to time, we may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.
Advertising Networks
Our website can be used by advertising networks to serve ads to the users visiting our website. Third party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other sites on the Internet.
Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting Ads Settings. For more information on how Google uses cookies in advertising and how you can opt out of the same, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
If a user opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the user's browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser.
When we present information to our advertisers - to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website - it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages / content within our website. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to third party websites / advertisers / ad-servers without your consent.
Amendments
We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes to this policy. We may also notify you of changes to this policy by email.
