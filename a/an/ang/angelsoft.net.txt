What is Website Data, and how is it used?
Website data is information that is not about an individual or specific group; rather, it is information about the overall traffic to our website. Examples include the number of visitors to the Angelsoft.net web site and the number of registered users of the Angelsoft platform. Angelsoft may extract and use such web traffic data for purposes including, but not limited to, traffic analysis and business decision making. The statistics generated in this manner contain no personal data and cannot be used to gather any information about individual visitors to the site.
Angelsoft may also use non-identifying "cookies" to provide you with easier site navigation. A cookie is a small amount of data sent to a user's web browser from a web server, which is then stored on the user's hard drive. Angelsoft's cookies do not generate any personal data, do not read personal data from your computer and are never tied to any personally identifiable information.
