Privacy Policy | anonymoX
We would like to inform you on this page, which data are generated while using anonymoX, which of them are saved, why we save them and how we protect them against unauthorised access. We differentiate between the usage of this website and the usage of our service anonymoX which is brought to you with the Software/Addon we provide for your browser.
1. Add-On and anonymity network
With the usage of our software your addon gets a random ID. This ID is used to save traffic usage.
While using anonymoX we save your IP-address temporarily to prevent an abuse of our service. The IP is not saved to a permanent memory storage but to a volatile memory. As soon as you turn off or don't use anonymoX anymore, the IP-address is deleted automatically. We don't track your IP-addresses.
Without any reference to you, we count how many users and how much traffic is passing a specific proxy and a statistic about the usage of our service is generated, for example about the popularity of websites. This enables us to optimize the speed and workload of our service.
Logs are not saved
The proxy-generated logfiles, which are used to extract the mentioned data, will be saved for less than 5 minuts in a volatile memory. They are not saved to a permanent memory storage.
If you explicity accepted that we collect anonymized usage statistics in the anonymoX software, we will track for example through which icon you opened the settings and which proxy are used for which websites. This data is generated and saved without any reference to you, too.
Information about program errors will be sent automatically, so we can figure out and fix the problems. This includes proxy selfcheck problems.
If you use the free service of anonymoX, advertising partners may set cookies in your browser.
If you explicitly opt-in to our usage data collection, the following data will be collected: Usage data collection
