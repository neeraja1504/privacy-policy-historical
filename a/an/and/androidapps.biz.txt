These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to APK Support in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. We also partner with a limited number of interest-based advertising companies to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our websites. Interest-based advertising companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit to our websites in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you.

Use of Third Party Ad Networks and Social Networks
APK Support expects its partners, advertisers to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on APK Support page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through APK Support you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.

Through features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. APK Support does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
