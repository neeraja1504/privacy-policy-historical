Privacy Policy - AndroidShock
At AndroidShock, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. As part of this responsibility, we let you know what information we collect when you surf our site, why we collect it, and how we use it to improve your experience. Our Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information.
The information we collect and store
Information you provide.  When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.
Cookies.  Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
IP address.  Every computer and device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country, state, and city from which a computer is connecting to the Internet. Because IP addresses need to be used by websites in order for the Internet to function, website owners have access to the IP addresses for their visitors regardless of whether or not they visit AndroidShock. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement and gather broad demographic information for internal use. AndroidShock does not share actual IP address information with AndroidShock customers.
