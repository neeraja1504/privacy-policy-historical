Privacy Statement | Andy Beard
Please don’t interact with this website if you are under 13 – I have no wish to have any of your personal data.
You can opt-out of any tracking you are concerned about here: http://optout.aboutads.info/
If you leave a comment, your email address will be stored in my database on my server. Please refer to my comments policy about how I reserve the right to contact you if you leave a comment for some reasons, at my own discretion.
I don’t share your personal information (email address) with a spam detection service such as Akismet.
At one time I used Disqus for comments but removed them for privacy reasons.
I use various forms of tracking, and some of these services don’t identify personal data, and others might come to a greater or lesser extent. I will almost always know typical details like what IP address you have, browser, screen resolution, where you came from, and what pages you read.
At certain times I may also know what actions you took on my site, such as which links were clicked, and with some services (historically like MyBlogLog), I may even be able to identify data down to individual people.
Subscriptions by RSS are effectively anonymous. For email subscriptions, the service is provided by Feedburner, and isn’t anonymous, as I get to see email addresses.
I try to keep all data secure, and where possible I will delete it upon request.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads all over the internet, and maybe on this site on occasion.
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visits to this site and other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
