Web Privacy and Security Statement :: Andrews University
Andrews University respects your privacy. Web servers are generally capable of collecting, storing and analyzing a variety of information about those who visit the site. Our goal is to keep the information collected at this website secure and to use it only for purposes for which it was intended or to improve the quality of the web service we provide. To inform you of our policies, we provide the following detailed information about our data collection processes.
What information is collected?
Andrews University does not collect your personally identifiable information when you visit one of our websites unless you choose to provide that information to us. We do collect the following to improve service and to monitor and preserve the functioning of the system:
Internet address of computer being used (IP address)
Web pages requested
Referring web page
Web browser utilized
Operating System of the computer being used
Date and time
Username for authenticated services
Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website stores on an individualâ€™s computer for the purpose of remembering login information or user preferences. Cookies will never be used to store private information.
Sharing of Information
From time to time, individuals or companies under contract with the University may have access to confidential information in the course of the service they provide to the University, but those entities are not permitted to use or re-disclose that information for unauthorized purposes. No other entities are authorized to collect information through Andrews University websites.
Other than the previously stated conditions, Andrews University will not share information regarding your website usage or any other personal information without your consent unless required by compliance to law or in response to a law enforcement investigation or court order.
Security and Accuracy of Confidential Data Including Financial Transactions
We care about the safety and security of your information. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to communicate with your browser software when personally identifiable data including financial and credit card information is being entered and processed. SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card or other information that you provide to us. In addition, there are many other security measures that Andrews University utilizes to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information we process.
We have partnered with a commercial Internet financial services provider to handle credit card transactions, and we do not store credit card information on Andrews University servers.
