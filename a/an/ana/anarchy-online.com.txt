Personal Information : Funcom collects information you voluntarily provide during the registration process in order to grant you access to products and service provided by Funcom and its affiliates.

Information In Transit: To protect private and confidential information from interception and visibility to unauthorized persons while in transit, the connection between your web browser and the registration server operated by Funcom is encrypted and verified using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. When setting up a unique session between you and Funcom, the server at Funcom will send its public key to your browser. In return, your browser will generate a randomly generated secret key based on the key it received from Funcom. This key is then sent back and checked by the server at Funcom. Transferring personal data over the Internet may involve transferring the data on electronic systems in jurisdictions with a different level of data protection regulations than in the EEA. By accepting this Privacy Policy you accept that transfer of personal data can take place over the Internet by use of electronic systems in such jurisdictions.
