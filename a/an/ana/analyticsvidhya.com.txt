Privacy Policy - Analytics Vidhya
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Analytics Vidhya, and our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us here.
When you clicked “accept” or “agree” in connection with registering your account, we made available to you this Privacy Policy and the information handling practices described in here. This Privacy Policy only covers Analytics Vidhya’s practices regarding personal information, and not information more generally. We may use aggregated, anonymized data that we derived from your personal information before you deleted it, but not in a manner that incorporates any of your personal information or would identify you personally.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with Analytics Vidhya, in which case Analytics Vidhya may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Services.
Commitment
The privacy of our Website users, whether you are our former or existing registered user or merely a visitor to our Website, is very important to us and we are strongly committed to your right to privacy and to keeping your personal and other information secure. We encourage you to read our privacy statement to understand what types of personally identifiable information we collect and how we use this information.
Information Analytics Vidhya Collects
We collect information to provide better Services to all our users. When you’re not signed into an Analytics Vidhya account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. When you’re signed in, we collect information that we store with your Analytics Vidhya account.
Things You Create or Provide to Us
When you create an Analytics Vidhya account, submit competition entries, apply to job postings or otherwise use the Services, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You may also provide your mailing address and home/mobile phone number, or other personal information.
Your provision of this personal data is required for you to enter into the Terms of Use, a contract, with us, as well as for you to enter competitions hosted and for applying on job postings on the Services. These entries are also a contract between you and the competition host, and we need your personal information to host the Services offered under that contract (see the Terms of Use for additional information). If you do not provide the minimum amount of personal data required to register an account, including your name and email address, you cannot use the Services, as this information is necessary for contractual reasons. Please see “European Requirements” below for further information on the bases for our processing your personal information.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our Services. This includes things like messages you write and receive, forum posts, activities, datasets, and competition submissions.
Information We Collect as You Use Our Services
Your apps, browsers & devices
We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access our Services or open one of our HTML emails by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (also known as “IP address”) or other device address or ID, web browser or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Services, the pages you view on the Services, and the dates and times that you visit the Services.
We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.
Your activity
We collect information about your activity in our Services, which may include:
Views and interactions with content and ads.
People with whom you communicate or share content.
Which datasets you view or download.
Cookies and web beacons
When you use the Services, we send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. For example, we use cookies to ensure proper navigation between pages on the Services. Analytics Vidhya may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services.
Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser’s “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. If you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.
We may also implement on the Services third party content, such as advertising or analytic services, that uses “clear gifs,” “web beacons,” or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser or implement similar tracking mechanisms. This information is collected directly by the third party, and Analytics Vidhya does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies . We currently implement services provided by Intercom, Google Analytics, Facebook, and Microsoft Application Insights, CleverTap, HotJar, Amazon, Firebase, OneSignal, Discourse, JetPack.
Linked accounts
When you link an account you may have on a third party service (such as a third party social networking site or email provider) to your Analytics Vidhya account, Analytics Vidhya collects certain information stored in connection with that account that you have configured that service to make available, including your email address, provider ID, first and last name, and profile picture. By linking your accounts in this manner, you authorize Analytics Vidhya to access and use your account on the third party service in connection with your use of the Services.
Why Analytics Vidhya Collects Information
Analytics Vidhya uses the information we collect for the following purposes:
Provide Our Services
We use your information to deliver our Services, like administering competitions you enter or hosting datasets you upload or access. For example, we use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a dataset. Another example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Analytics Vidhya account.
Maintain & Improve Our Services
We also use your information to ensure our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
And we use your information to make improvements to our Services – for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Analytics Vidhya account members and to improve the way the Services work and look.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our Services, which can help us build better products. It may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
Develop New Services
We use the information we collect in existing Services to help us create new features and functionality.
Provide Personalized Services
We use the information we collect to customize our Services for you, including remembering your information so that you will not have to log-in again the next time you visit the Services if you haven’t signed out. We also use data to provide customized third party content and information and to track your status in any Competitions or other activities. In addition, we may use the information we collect to provide personalized and relevant advertising, for example showing you positions from our jobs board in your location based on your IP address.
Measure Performance
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Services and related activities, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by Analytics Vidhya. You can opt-out from Google Analytics by clicking here.
Communicate with You
We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity on your account, or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our Services. We will also use your email address to contact you with respect to competition entries, prize awards and otherwise in connection with competitions; for administrative and customer service purposes; to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues; or regarding things you post on the Services. And if you contact Analytics Vidhya, we’ll keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Analytics Vidhya also uses your email address or other personal information to send you messages about the Services and communications from other Members. We may also send you messages related to the Services and the activities of third parties we work with. These messages may be targeted at you based on your activities on our Services, for example your interaction with a particular dataset or your entry into a specific competition. You will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications through links provided in the messages, or by sending us a mail at privacy@analyticsvidhya.com
Protect Analytics Vidhya, Our Users, and the Public
We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our Services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Analytics Vidhya, our users, or the public. For example, we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse can take many forms, such as sending spam to Analytics Vidhya users or launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
Managing and Deleting Your Information
Managing, Reviewing, and Updating Your Information
When you’re signed into your Analytics Vidhya account, you can always review and update information by visiting your account profile.
Exporting, Removing & Deleting Your Information
You can export a copy of content in your Analytics Vidhya account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Analytics Vidhya by contacting us here . You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page or editing your Analytics Vidhya account profile through the Services.
You can also delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and kernels by using the available tools in our Services. If desired, you can delete your entire Analytics Vidhya account by choosing that option in your account settings page.
Please note that while your deletions are reflected promptly in active member databases, in some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes. See “Data Retention” below for more information.
There are other ways to control the information Analytics Vidhya collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Analytics Vidhya account, including configuring your browser to indicate when Analytics Vidhya has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our Services rely on cookies to function properly.
Account Deletion
As we describe above, you can request for deletion of your entire Analytics Vidhya account by mailing us on privacy@analyticsvidhya.com
Information Retained For Extended Time Periods for Limited Purposes
Sometimes business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for specific purposes for an extended period of time. For example, when you submit an entry in a competition or apply on job posting, we may retain this information for a longer period of time to guard against cheating, for example, or for legal purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:
Security, fraud & abuse prevention
Financial record-keeping
Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
Ensuring the continuity of our services
Enabling Safe and Complete Deletion
When you submit request to delete your Analytics Vidhya account, we begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. Safe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss. Complete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users’ peace of mind. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of request.
Sharing Your Information
When You Share Your Information
Many of our Services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in an area of the Services accessible to other Analytics Vidhya members, such as a public profile page or in a posting, will be available to other Analytics Vidhya members who access that content. This also applies to information you choose to make available through features that connect to third party services, if applicable.
Also, if you communicate directly with another Analytics Vidhya member, any information that you voluntarily choose to include in such a communication with other Analytics Vidhya members will be available to such other members. Once you make your information available in any of these ways, it could be collected and used by the recipients without restriction. We urge Analytics Vidhya members to exercise common sense, prudence and good judgment about what information to make available to others through the Services.

These third parties may have access to or process your personal information as a result of performing the services they were engaged to perform.
