We are constantly reviewing our processes and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access and use, accidental loss and/or destruction. Sometimes we use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf. We don't allow them to use this information for their own commercial purposes and they have to follow our strict instructions and comply with appropriate security measures.

We need to know approximately where you are so that we can deliver mobile phone services to you. Location information (such as your Cell ID) is relayed to us and some of our partners when your phone is turned on or when you use the services. This information will also be shared with the emergency services so that when you make an emergency call, the emergency services are able to respond more quickly to the call. Location information cannot usually be used to pinpoint exactly where you are. For example, it cannot usually be used to determine which particular house or shop you are in at a given time. Instead it offers an approximate location based on your position relative to the nearest mobile phone masts. The accuracy of this information depends on how close you are to a mobile phone mast and is likely to be more accurate in urban areas compared to rural areas.This location information may also be used to provide you with services that are linked to your location such as:
traffic reports
entertainment listings
targeted offers (as further described in our section 3 how we use your personal information)
map services (for this, we will use your GPS location if enabled on your phone)
Some of these services are called active location services because you are asking us to check your location in order for the service to be provided. There are other forms of location based services where you might agree to be located by someone else or you might want to locate someone else using the location information we generate. These services are called passive location services. We describe our phone locator services and other passive location based services offered by our partners below.Phone locator servicesWe have put in place measures that fully comply with the Industry Code of Practice for the Use of Mobile Phone Technology to Provide Passive Location Services in the UK ("the Code").These include measures to verify the identity of the person wishing to use the passive location service and to ensure the ongoing consent of the person whose phone is being located. For more information about the Code please click on www1.orange.co.uk/codesofpractice. One of the key requirements of this Code is that the person who is to be located must consent to being located and regular reminders about the location service must be sent to their mobile phone so that they can opt out at any time. Other passive location servicesYou may receive certain passive location services in circumstances where you have adjusted settings or activated certain features on your phone. For example, if your phone has 'Bluetooth' enabled, you may receive messages from third parties located nearby. If you do not wish to receive these services, we suggest you de-activate the relevant feature(s) on your phone or contact the third parties directly.
You can ask us to include your contact details including your name or trading name, address and mobile phone number in a telephone directory which will make them available through directory enquiry services. If you want your contact details including your mobile phone number to be included in a directory enquiry service, please contact our Customer Services team.We may provide services that enable our customers and the public to find out which of their friends are on the T-Mobile or the Orange network by searching mobile phone numbers.
