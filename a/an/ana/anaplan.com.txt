Anaplan Privacy Policy | Anaplan
Effective date: May 8 th, 2019
Data privacy is important to Anaplan, Inc. and its related entities in your jurisdiction (collectively “Anaplan”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) provides an overview of the personal information Anaplan collects and how it is protected during your visit to anaplan.com or other Anaplan websites that link to this Policy (collectively the “Websites”). The primary purpose of the Websites is to be an informative resource and business tool to help you manage and improve business performance. We want you to feel secure when visiting our Websites and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so.
Information on the Websites is collected in two ways:
Indirectly (for example, through the Websites’ technology)
Directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages of the Websites)
One example of information we collect indirectly is through our Internet access logs. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring /exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.
Anaplan and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. https://www.anaplan.com/cookie-policy/
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may learn more about how to opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served all ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us such as your first name, last name, email address, phone number, job title and company name. Throughout our Websites, we provide the opportunity to register for an event or conference, order a white paper, or participate in an online survey. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for information and how this information will be used. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it.
We may occasionally send newsletters or marketing communications out to those who have registered at our Websites, including our users. We provide you the opportunity to opt out of such emails by following the directions provided in these emails.
Data submitted through the Anaplan Platform

How we use personal information
We use this information to: determine what is most effective about our Websites and marketing, assist in product marketing, help us identify ways to improve our Websites and marketing, and determine how we can tailor the Websites to make them more effective. We may also use personal information for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information.
How we share personal information

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us or on our behalf. Before you submit any information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for specific information and it is up to you whether or not you want to provide it.

We may share your information with these business partners if you express interest in such products, services or events If you provide your personal information to event sponsors at their booths or presentations, you should review their privacy policies to learn how they use personal information.
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request or to any third party with your consent to do so. We will have no duty to notify you of such compliance with local law where applicable.
If Anaplan is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Websites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Anaplan will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to those described above without first notifying you and offering you a choice as to whether or not we may use your personal information in a different manner.
What about sensitive personal information?

We may also collect some sensitive personal data incidentally. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law as described in this Policy. The references to “sensitive personal data” are to the various categories of personal data identified by European and other data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent. These categories comprise personal identity numbers, personal data about personality and private life, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, political opinions, membership of political parties or movements, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union or profession or trade association, physical or mental health, genetic code, addictions, sexual life, property matters or criminal record (including information about suspected criminal activities).
