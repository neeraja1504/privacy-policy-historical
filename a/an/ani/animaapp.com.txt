We take steps to limit the promotional content we send you to a reasonable and
proportionate level, and to send you information which we believe may be of
interest or relevance to you, based on your information.
72. Service and Billing Messages:
AnimaApp may also contact you with important information regarding our
Services, or your use thereof.
For example, we may send you a notice (through any of the means available to
us) if a certain Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance; reply to your
support ticket or e-mail; send you reminders or warnings regarding upcoming or
late payments for your current or upcoming subscriptions; forward abuse
complaints regarding your User Website; or notify you of material changes in our
Services.
It is important that you are always able to receive such messages. For this
reason, you are not be able to opt-out of receiving such Service and Billing
Messages unless you are no longer a AnimaApp Visitor or User (which can be
done by deactivating your account).
Data Retention
73. We may retain your Personal Information (as well as your Users-of-Users’
Information) for as long as your User Account is active, as indicated in this
Privacy Policy or as otherwise needed to provide you with our Services.
We may continue to retain such Personal Information even after you deactivate
your User Account and/or cease to use any particular Services, as reasonably
necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our
Users or their Users-of-Users, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements
and/or protect our legitimate interests.
We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to information in our care.
Where your Personal Information is no longer required we will ensure it is
securely deleted.
Security
19
AnimaApp has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal
Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural
measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on
our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit
card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry
standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS
(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly
monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek
new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our
Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.
Regardless of the measures and efforts taken by AnimaApp, we cannot and do
not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information,
your Users-of-Users’ Information or any other User Content you upload, publish
or otherwise share with AnimaApp or anyone else.
We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and
User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive information of
which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.
Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others
(for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of
“Private”, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant
messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request
and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas
or via any of these methods.
If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome
to contact us at ​privacy@animaapp.com​.
Public Forums and User Content
Our Services offer publicly accessible websites, blogs, communities and support
forums. Please be aware that any information you provide in any such areas may
be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of
your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to
contact us at: privacy@animaapp.com. In some cases, we may not be able to
20
remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a
third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin
application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you
must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove the
Personal Information you posted on that platform.
76. In any event, we advise against posting any information (or use any posting
means to post information) you don’t wish to publicize on these platforms.
77. If you upload any User Content to your User Account or post it on your User
Website and/or provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you
do so at your own risk.
78. We have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal
Information. However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members
of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the
circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have
placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas
on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its
removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and
archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have
copied or stored such User Content. To clarify, we advise against uploading or
posting any information you do not wish to be public
Updates and Interpretation
79. We may update this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law, and to reflect
changes to our information collection, usage and storage practices. We
encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our
privacy practices.
80. Unless stated otherwise, our most current Privacy Policy applies to all
information that we have about you and your Users-of-Users, with respect to our
Websites, AnimaApp Apps, Mobile Apps, plugins and other Services.
