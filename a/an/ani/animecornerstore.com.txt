Privacy / Security Statement
Site Security at the Anime Corner Store
_I Want you to Feel Comfortable Placing an Order! _
_I know that you are concerned about Internet security. So am I! That's why we have built in some of the most advanced security technologies available for an on-line shopping site. The Store portion of Robert's Anime Corner uses a server which supports advanced 128-bit SSL encryption. Here's how it works:
SSL encryption is active on our site in all areas where customer information is requested. You can check to see that you have entered an SSL-active area by looking on the bottom of your screen. If you see
**an unbroken key or a closed lock ** (depending on your browser), you will know that SSL technology is in place and ready to encrypt your information. _
_You'll see a key (Netscape) or a closed lock  (AOL & Internet Explorer).
You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When you are in an SSL-active area, the first letters of our website address will change from  "http:" ** to  "https:" ** (the 's' means 'secure').
When you place your order with my store online, your information is
**transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form , ** which is then decoded when it gets to our computers here. Your personal information, including your credit card information, is safe from prying eyes. _
_**Shop with confidence! ** _
Your Privacy and the Use of Your Personal Information
