The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of AnimeThunder.com involves cookies. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered on AnimeThunder.com, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the site. Cookies help AnimeThunder.com track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to AnimeThunder.com. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users’ preferences. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of AnimeThunder.com. Certain pages of AnimeThunder.com may contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel GIF” or “web beacon”) that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page.
