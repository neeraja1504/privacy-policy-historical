If you visit an unsecure area of the ANZ website (for example, an area where you are not required to log on) to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit to our site, the pages viewed and any information downloaded. If you are a customer and have previously accessed ANZ Internet Banking, then we can also use unique identifiers associated with your device to collect information about your activities on ANZ’s websites and third party websites that have ANZ content. We can combine that information with your personal information, in accordance with our ANZ Privacy Statement. If you are not a customer then this activity is collected anonymously.

The ANZ website offers a number of interactive facilities including tools such as budget planners and calculators, as well as online surveys and application forms.

You agree that this applies even if you save, suspend or cancel the interactive facility, without submitting your information to us.

You may later recover the information you have entered when you resume your plan.
