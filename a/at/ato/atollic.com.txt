10. International Transfers of Your Personal Data
ST may transfer your Personal Data to any ST group company worldwide when processing, storing and using information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

To the extent your Personal Data would be transferred to a country or territory outside the EEA that does not ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of Personal Data, we have in place requirements relating to such international data transfers. For example, where we transfer your information: (i) between ST affiliates, this is done pursuant to an agreement based on the EEA Data Export Contractual Clauses, and (ii) to third parties, we use specific contractual clauses designed to ensure those third parties respect the confidentiality of your personal data and use it only in connection with providing their services to use and in compliance with applicable data privacy laws.  If you would like further details, you can contact us by using the contact email address detailed in Section 17 of this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, Personal Data that you post or submit for publication on ST Sites may be available, via the internet, around the world. ST cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.
11. Security of Your Personal Data
ST pays attention to the security of your Personal Data, and therefore ST uses various security technologies to protect it, including secure servers, firewalls and encrypted solutions and reasonable and appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within ST organization against unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration, disclosure or destruction.
However, transmissions over the internet are never entirely secure or error-free and ST does not guarantee the security of the information communicated to and/or from ST Sites. It is your responsibility to safeguard any password, user ID and other Personal Data while using ST Sites.
12. Minors and children under the age of 13
The ST Sites are not directed at, and are not intended for minors and children under the age of thirteen (13). ST will not knowingly collect data from children without proper parental consent. If you believe that ST may have collected Personal Data from someone under the age of thirteen (13), or under the applicable age of consent in your country, without parental consent, you can contact ST to take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly. Parents wishing to access, review or delete their child’s Personal Data may contact ST by using the contact email address detailed in Section 17 of this Privacy Policy.
13. Automated decision making
ST uses software to help us better understand how you like us to communicate with you and whether you may be interested in our products and services. For example, based on our records that you have recently shown interest in a certain product, our software helps us identify related products and services that may interest you. We may then use this to contact you about these.
ST may provide social computing tools to enable online sharing and collaboration among registered users. These include forums, wikis, blogs, instant messaging, open-source development and other social media platforms. When registering to use certain social computing tools on ST Sites, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Data.
