Privacy Policy | Atomic Object
This Privacy Policy applies atomicobject.com, spin.atomicobject.com, atomobj.io, and greatnotbig.com (and the associated social media accounts/pages), all of which are owned and operated by Atomic Object LLC (the “Site(s)”). This Privacy Policy describes how Atomic Object LLC (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide in relation to the Sites only and does not represent all privacy practices conducted by us in our business. It describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
The use of information collected through the Sites shall be limited to the purposes of: (i) providing a service to you and other Users of the Sites (“Users”); (ii) the purpose for which you signed up to receive communications from us; and/or (iii) understanding companies and organizations interested in working with us. If you do not want your personal information to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use these Sites.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
Personal Information
Information that could be used to identify or contact you is considered “Personal Information” under this Privacy Policy. Personal Information may include things such as first and last name, contact information, email address, physical address, and contents of your communication. Whether we collect Personal Information from you depends on how you use our Sites. Generally, when using our Sites, we may collect Personal Information in three ways: (i) you provide it to us through an inquiry, or (ii) you provide it to us through comments on our blog or social media, or (iii) you provide it to us when subscribing to blog post comments, or blog post feeds. Within the United States of America, we may additionally collect Personal Information from certain social media profiles.
We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:
To better understand how Users access and use our Sites, both on an aggregated and individual User basis, on individual Sites and across them in order to improve our Sites and respond to User desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes;
To better understand companies and organizations interested in our services;
To provide services to you, which may include responding to your inquiries and troubleshooting problems;
For marketing and promotional purposes, including, for example, to send you notifications of new blog posts, or to otherwise contact you about projects or information we think may interest you provided you have opted into receiving such communications from us; and
To protect our own rights and interests, such as to resolve any disputes, enforce our Terms of Use, and to respond to legal requests.
We only collect the minimum amount of Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving the aforementioned purposes. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other Users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
If you submit any Personal Information to us in response to a job posting (e.g. your resume), this may be shared with third parties (including external tools and services we use to manage our talent pool), depending on the nature of your inquiry. Personal Information collected in this capacity will be used solely for the purpose specified; such information is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Non-Identifying Information
Certain information that does not identify you (“Non-Identifying Information”) would only be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (e.g., your country and gender). We may combine your Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with Non-Identifying Information collected from other Users of the Sites to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Sites, and to analyze and understand how the Sites are used.
In general, we will gather some Non-Identifying Information automatically. This information includes your Internet service provider (“ISP”), device type, browser type, browser language and regional settings, geographic region, referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream. We gather this information using third-party services including Google Analytics, Chartbeat, and HotJar for monitoring website performance and determining customer service and Site needs. Please visit the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about their privacy practices and your opt-out choices.
Within the United States of America, we may gather some Non-Identifying Information from social media profiles if you have not opted-out of sharing such information through the associated social media service. We use this information to better understand companies interested in our services.

This information may include the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, access times and dates, your computer browser information, your IP address, and other statistics (“Log Data”). We use Log Data for the Sites’ technical administration, to increase our Sites’ functionality and User-friendliness, and to better tailor the Sites to our Users’ needs.

Regarding Children and Minors
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Users under the age of 13 (“Child” or “Children”). If we learn that a Child’s Personal Information has been collected, we will delete the information.

Storage and Transfer of Your Information
Depending on the Site you are using, or how you contact us, your information is stored on the servers of our service providers. Please note that information we collect from you will be stored and processed in the United States.
Security of Your Information
We use reasonable physical, procedural, technical and administrative security measures to protect your Personal Information against loss or theft – as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100 percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Please note that removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers (e.g., in backups).

Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at privacy@atomicobject.
