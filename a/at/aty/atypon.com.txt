Disclosure and sharing of your information
Atypon will not disclose to or share your personal information with any unaffiliated third party except as follows:
Where necessary in connection with services provided by third parties (i) that provide us with a wide range of office, administrative, information technology, production, payment, or business management services, and (ii) that are required to comply with this policy;
Where you voluntarily provide information in response to an advertisement from a third party;

Where Atypon is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities and government agencies, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; to comply with a subpoena or other legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our services, users, or others; and to investigate fraud; and
Where all or substantially all of the business or assets of Atypon relating to our services are sold, assigned, or transferred to another entity.

Cross-border transfers
Atypon may transfer your personal information outside of your country of residence for the following reasons:
In order to process your transactions, we may store your personal information on our servers, and those servers may reside outside the country where you live. Atypon has servers and major office locations in several countries, as listed at https://www.atypon.com/contact/. Atypon also has service providers located in the US amongst other countries. Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details, and the provision of support services.
In order to satisfy global reporting requirements, Atypon may be required to provide your personal information to Atypon affiliates, subsidiaries, or its parent company in other countries.
By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing of your information. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws.
Security
We will use appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your data. Access to your personal data will be restricted to only those who require that information to perform their job function. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and security of your information.
Disclosure in chat rooms or forums
You should be aware that identifiable personal information—such as your name or email address—that you voluntarily disclose and that is accessible to other users (e.g., on social media, forums, bulletin boards, or in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. Atypon cannot take any responsibility for such collection and disclosure.
