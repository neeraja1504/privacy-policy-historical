This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of the American Type Culture Collection ("ATCC®", "we", "us", or "our") and our use of information. This Privacy Policy describes how we use the personally identifiable information that you provide to us offline (e.g., through postal mail or fax) or online (e.g., through our website located at www.atcc.org (the "Site")).

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make changes that affect the way we collect or use your personally identifiable information, these changes and their effective date will be posted in this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after we post a revised Privacy Policy means you have accepted the Privacy Policy. If we materially change our practices for the collection or use of your personally identifiable information, your personally identifiable information will be governed by the Policy under which it was originally collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have had an opportunity to object to, the change.
