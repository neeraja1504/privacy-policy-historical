Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of AtContent and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
AtContent may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. AtContent may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.

Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, AtContent will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
AtContent does use the services of third parties, such as email service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtContent. You may also use your third party login accounts and passwords (e.g. Facebook; Twitter) in order to register and login to the Website and use AtContent’s services. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose AtContent specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the AtContent’s affiliates for their use without your approval.
AtContent may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AtContent may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the CompanyAtContent or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
In the event that all or substantially all of AtContent’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AtContent may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Choices Available to You
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such services.

We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.
AtContent is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.
When you create a personal account with AtContent and/or provide your email address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via email and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to AtContent offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom AtContent has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you.

We may use a third party email service provider to send emails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send AtContent related email. If you do not wish to receive emails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: unsubscribe@atcontent.com. In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. You may also opt-out online by updating your personal account as described in the Updating Your Personal References section of this Privacy Policy (above).
