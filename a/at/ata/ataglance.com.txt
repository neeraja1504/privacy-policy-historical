Ataglance.com - Privacy & Security Notice
Safe, Secure Checkout
We understand your concerns about online security. We take measures designed to protect the security of the information you provide to us, including the use of Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") security technology to safeguard your shopping transactions and encrypt your payment information. When you check out, your browser will automatically be linked to our secure commerce server, encrypting all personal information before it is transmitted over the Internet. The result is a website offering the highest level of service, convenience and trustworthiness our customers have come to expect from us.
The Secure Order Process
When you make a purchase, request a catalog or create an account on our website, your transactional information is transmitted to us in an industry standard encrypted format.
Using ATG's Commerce software, in conjunction with features built into popular browser software, our site provides advanced security for your online purchases.
Once you start the order process by clicking the "Checkout" button on the shopping cart page or log into "My Account", the security features are automatic and you don't need to do anything special to invoke them. Your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm communication with ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop. Once a positive ID is made, your order continues. Your computer and our server begin communicating in secure mode, sending data back and forth in an encrypted format. At this point you may see a pop-up window, which some browsers display when you are about to receive a secure document. It's fine to click "OK" (or "Continue") to allow your order to proceed and  you will begin receiving pages in an encrypted format.
After your browser has entered secure mode, we'll ask you to enter (or, if you're using Quick Checkout, to confirm) your credit card information. The encryption features of browser software are powerful and help to provide for the security of this data as it is transmitted to our server. Our site makes use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and 128-bit strong encryption to provide a high level of security.
Security measures continue even after you've placed your order, as we process your order in a secure computing environment.
Security: Watching It Work
It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. While no data storage or transmission can ever be totally secure, we use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of your data.
The most popular web browsers use clear visual symbols to let you know whether or not they are in secure mode. The symbols are displayed either at the bottom left or bottom right of your browser window and resemble a closed lock.
Another indication that a browser is in secure mode can be found in the website address displayed by your browser. The address will begin "http://" in standard, non-secure mode and "https://" in secure mode. The "s" stands for "secure."
If You Forget Your Password
In the event you forget your "My Account" password, we offer an online process that verifies your identity and allows you to receive a new password.
Your Privacy Rights
We appreciate the trust you place in us, and we are committed to respecting your privacy and the security of your personal information. Our privacy policy, updated on May 28, 2010, describes the information we collect and how we use it.
We always welcome your questions and feedback. For privacy-related issues, please contact us at:

Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights
We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, email distribution, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop.
From time to time, we may make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices are represented as meeting the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. If you prefer that we do not share any of your information with these companies, please contact us.
We may also offer certain carefully chosen third party services through our site.  Should you choose to accept an offer from a third party, we will pass your relevant personal information, including your name, postal address, email, credit/debit card number and any other customer information required to that third party in order to facilitate the service or transaction that you request.
We may be required to disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other communications from ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please contact us at the address shown at the top. If you no longer wish to receive our emails you also may contact us at the address above or unsubscribe using the link provided in each edition of the email.

Please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog, so that we can be sure to identify you correctly.

If you continue to receive unwanted communications, please contact us again and we will make every effort to correct the situation.
Cookies and Pixel Tags
A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies enable you to place an order on our website. They also allow us to enhance and personalize your online shopping experience, so that the information you receive is more relevant to you.
For example, we use cookies to:
Remember what items are in your shopping cart
Recognize you when you return to our website
Enable you to use Quick Checkout, if you have created an account at ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop
Study how our customers navigate through our website and which products they request in site searches
If you set your browser to refuse cookies or experience an issue placing your order online, please call us at 800.365.9327 to place your order.
We also use pixel tags â?? tiny graphic images â?? to tell us what parts of our Web site you have visited or to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may do on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us.
We also may contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop.
How We Use Email
When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails necessary to process your order or respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email of shipping confirmation with package tracking information.
It is our intent to send you promotional email (promotions and special offers) only if you have agreed to receive it. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are included in each email and can be modified at anytime by logging onto "My Account" and changing your communication preferences.
Links to Other Sites
Occasionally we provide links on our website to other sites we think you will enjoy. We also provide direct links to selected third party marketing partners which offer goods or services which you can purchase directly by linking through to their site.  These sites operate independently of ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, and mead.com/shop and have their own privacy and security policies which may differ from those at ataglance.com, dayrunner.com, or mead.com/shop. We strongly encourage you to review these policies at any such third party site you visit or link to.  (See also: Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights, above)
