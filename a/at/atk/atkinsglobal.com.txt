Introduction
This Privacy Notice applies to all Personal Data that SNC-Lavalin and other subsidiary or affiliated companies of SNC-Lavalin (referred to throughout as “SNC-Lavalin”) and any websites or equivalent internet resources may generally collect, process and store about you.
By providing your Personal Data to SNC-Lavalin, you expressly acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Notice.

The privacy and security of the Personal Data collected from you is a priority to SNC-Lavalin. It is also important to us that you understand how we handle this data.
SNC-Lavalin’s Data Privacy Principles
Data Privacy is built into everything we do. Our data privacy principles apply to everything we do, no matter where we do it. To this end:
SNC-Lavalin takes responsibility for the Personal Data we hold and process.
Personal Data is collected and processed fairly, lawfully, transparently and in accordance with our Code of Conduct and Data Privacy Compliance Policy Framework.
Processing of Personal Data is always documented and assessed at the outset to ensure there is the minimum privacy risk and impact to individuals.
Personal Data of individuals is always protected, secure and kept confidential.
Personal Data is collected only where necessary for legal, regulatory and business purposes and only used for the purposes it was collected for.
Personal Data is only retained for as long as is necessar y to achieve the original processing purpose or to satisfy our legal and regulatory obligations.
This policy sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.
For the purposes of any Data Protection legislation, the Data Controller is SNC-Lavalin.
What is the Basis for Processing this Personal Data?
Our processing of Personal Data is aimed purely to allow us to respond to your requests (such as for us to contact you, or to send you information) and is based on the following legal grounds:
Legal Basis | Example
---|---
Performance of a contract * | Where we enter into a contract for the provision of products or services, we may need to collect and process your personal data so that we can meet our contractual obligations. This also applies to any pre- contract activity, such as providing a quote or details regarding the products or services that you have expressed an interest in
*Regulatory and legal
obligations * | We may collect and process Personal Data to comply with our regulatory or legal obligations. For example, where we are legally obliged to keep records of sales and any associated tax records.
*Legitimate commercial
interests * | We may process Personal Data where such processing is necessary to pursue our legitimate commercial interests, such as operating our business and defending legal claims.
*Consent |  Where we rely specifically on consent to collect and process non-mandatory Personal Data, you are not obliged to provide your consent for the use of your Personal Data and you may subsequently withdraw your consent once it has been provided. It should be noted however that this may limit your experience with our resources and services.
What are my Data Privacy rights?
Every individual has the following rights in relation to the processing of their Personal Data by SNC-Lavalin:
The right to access and inspect their Personal Data or be provided with a permanent copy of the information being held about them.
The right to request the correction of any inaccuracies in their Personal Data or where the accuracy of information is disputed, to add additional information to give notice that they dispute the accuracy of the information content.
The right to request the erasure of their Personal Data, particularly where the continued processing of the information is no longer necessary.
The right to object to the processing of their Personal Data, particularly where there are no longer sufficient legitimate grounds for SNC-Lavalin to continue processing the information.
The right to restrict processing, data portability and the right to appeal any automated decision making or profiling.
The right to complain to a Data Protection Regulator about SNC-Lavalin’s processing of Personal Data.
It is important to note that the rights set out above are not unconditional and the specific circumstances of the processing being undertaken by SNC-Lavalin will determine if these rights may be exercised. Further information concerning these rights and their application can be obtained from the Data Protection Officer. ****

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
How is your Personal Data kept secure?
SNC-Lavalin have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data. We employ organisational and technical security measures, including password protection, encryption, physical locks, etc., to protect Personal Data and to ensure it is processed appropriately, consistently and in accordance with applicable data privacy laws and regulations. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
If you are authorized to have access to the Personal Data of others, it is important that you take appropriate safeguards to protect this Personal Data.
SNC-Lavalin monitors Internet traffic to detect access to inappropriate websites or other materials. SNC-Lavalin also uses email filters to block spam and computer viruses. It is possible that some legitimate email messages and websites may be blocked or hindered by these filters.
Disclosure of your information
We do not pass on or sell online personal information to third parties. We may however share information within our organisation and in some cases, it will be necessary to pass information to our pension or share administrators. This may include our employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors. Please note that by sending your personal information to us you are consenting to the processing and transfer of such information in this way.
How long is your Personal Data retained for?
We retain appropriate records of Personal Data for Regulatory, Legal and Contract administration purposes. We only keep Personal Data for as long as necessary for the purpose or purposes it was collected for. Records are retained for a predefined retention period that may extend beyond a contract with SNC-Lavalin. Personal Data is retained to comply with other legal and contractual obligations and requirements such as Health and Safety. Where required, further information concerning our records retention policy can be obtained from the SNC-Lavalin Data Protection Officer whose contact details are below.

We will endeavour to ensure that such transfers of Personal Data comply with all applicable data privacy laws and regulations and provide appropriate protection for the rights and freedoms conferred on all individuals under such laws.
