Atlanta.net Privacy Policy
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 24, 2018.
This Privacy Policy is provided by Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau ("ACVB") and applies to information collected from you by ACVB in the operation of its services, such as through the websites and mobile applications operated by ACVB ("ACVB Services"), which include, without limitation, atlanta.net, atlantameetings.com, IAMATL.net, ATLFiles.com, Discover Atlanta: Official Guide and Discover Atlanta 360ATL Tour mobile apps, promotional websites and any associated content, features and functionality including email and RSS feeds made available on ACVB Services. ACVB respects your privacy and confidentiality and maintains this Privacy Policy to help you understand its commitment to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to ACVB. This Privacy Policy outlines how ACVB collects and uses the information you provide to ACVB. It also explains the choices available to you regarding ACVB’s use of the information you provide to ACVB and how you can access and update this information.
Collection of Your Personal Information by ACVB; Use of Cookies and Tracking Tools
ACVB's mission is to provide you with personalized services and offerings designed to enhance your Atlanta experience. To do so effectively, ACVB may collect personal information (such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and other information) from you and we may do so in the following ways:
(a) directly from your verbal or written submission. If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be collected, please do not submit it.
(b) automatically through ACVB Services, which employ "cookie" and pixel technology, Local Storage, and other tracking tools; provided, however, that ACVB will not employ cookies or pixels to track the use of ACVB Services by users based in the European Union without such users’ consent. Cookies and pixels are small pieces of data stored in files on your computer allowing ACVB Services to track your use of ACVB Services as you visit and revisit such websites and applications. The use of cookies by ACVB Services complies with generally accepted programming standards and practices. Please note that you can choose to block the use of cookies and pixels through settings in your web browser but be advised that certain features of ACVB Services may not work properly without the use of cookies or pixels. ACVB Services are not set up to honor web browser do-not-track settings. “Local Storage” is similar to cookies and provides a way for a website to collect and store information "locally" (i.e., on the user's device rather than on the website’s server) and retrieve it later. Although Local Storage data is not typically sent to a website's servers, in some instances, we may transmit Local Storage data to our servers for the purpose of improving your experience on ACVB Services.
Use of Your Information by ACVB
It is the policy of ACVB not to sell, share, transfer, or rent to third parties any information you provide to ACVB, including information you provide through the use of ACVB Services, without your consent except as required by operation of the law or in compliance with legal authorities; provided, however ACVB may share your personal information with certain third parties ("Target Third Parties") without your consent in order to further the purpose for which you voluntarily provide ACVB with the information. Additionally, ACVB engages third party information management service providers, including, but not limited to, customer relationship management providers, to help maintain efficient operations. Because such information management service providers may access our systems, such information management service providers may have access to your information. ACVB does not transfer or relinquish ownership of information maintained about you within ACVB systems and databases to such information management service providers but requires these information management service providers to sign confidentiality agreements to keep all confidential information and other proprietary information found in ACVB systems confidential.
ACVB routinely collects, compiles, and reports statistics and information reflecting the use of ACVB Services and information services in order to enhance membership services, advertising services, improve marketing and promotional efforts, analyze usage of ACVB Services, improve ACVB Services' content and layout, generate aggregate reports on trends, interests and behavior and enhance service offerings.
ACVB may now or in the future work with third parties, including third party advertising networks and website analysis firms, who use cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit ACVB Services. This non-personally identifiable information, collected through cookies, pixels, Local Storage and other techniques, is often used by these advertising networks to serve you with advertisements tailored to meet your preferences and needs.
From time-to-time, ACVB may operate contests or promotions through ACVB Services or otherwise by itself or with one or more participating or co-sponsoring organizations and the Section below captioned “Contests and Promotions” further addresses certain information collection practices by ACVB and participating and co-sponsoring organizations as part of such contests or promotions.
ACVB reserves the right to take any action ACVB deems prudent or necessary to safeguard ACVB Services and your information in ACVB systems and databases from malicious or unwarranted attack by viruses, hackers, or other miscreants.
Links to Third Party Websites
In an attempt to provide increased value to users of ACVB Services, ACVB Services may link to, or contain links for, third party websites that we do not control or maintain. These may include websites linked to products referenced on ACVB Services or in advertisements on ACVB Services. We are not responsible for the terms and conditions or privacy practices employed by any such third party website accessible from ACVB Services. Access to such third party websites is at your own risk, and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of all third party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information while using such other websites.

Your Consent
Other than for European Union citizens, your use of any of ACVB Services constitutes your consent to the collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy of your information by ACVB (and Target Third Parties, in which case, once such Target Third Party is in possession of your information, we cannot control such Target Third Party's use of your information). If you do not agree with the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use ACVB Services.

Children’s Privacy and ACVB Website Age Limitations
ACVB Services are intended for use by persons aged 18 or older. ACVB does not knowingly allow use of ACVB Services by any person that ACVB believes to be younger than 18.

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, the other participating organizations, co-sponsors and their affiliates may also receive and use the information collected or may collect the information directly, and the use of such information shall be governed by the respective privacy policies of such participating organizations, co-sponsors and their affiliates.

ACVB reserves the right to transfer any personal information ACVB has about you in the event ACVB sells or transfers all or a portion of our business or assets, or merges with another organization.

Security of Personal Information of European Citizens
ACVB has policies and technical and organizational measures in place which are intended to safeguard and protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, improper use and disclosure.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, ACVB considers the scope, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, the purposes for which ACVB collected and processed your personal information and whether ACVB can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable legal and professional requirements.
