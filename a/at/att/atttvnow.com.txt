We may combine and use data, including Your Location Information and viewing data collected from the App with other data, as described in this Policy.
Do we share your information and, if so, with whom?

You may decline to consent or later withdraw your consent from the third-party streaming device.

This policy does not apply to information generated from the use of the AT&T TV device, such as what you click on or search for, and your voice commands. In this case, the AT&T TV Device Privacy Policy would apply.
