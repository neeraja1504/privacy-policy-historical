Attendance on Demand, Inc. hosts data for customers using its labor management service. When customers use biometric time clocks, finger or hand templates (“Templates”) are also stored. Some states, including Illinois and Texas, have statutes governing biometric information. Templates are digitally-converted representations of geometric measurements of the hand or fingerprint. Templates may or may not be deemed to be biometric information under such statutes. Attendance on Demand’s policy is designed to protect and store the Templates in accordance with applicable standards and biometric information laws.
Storage of Biometric Data
Templates are stored in time clocks and in the customer’s Attendance on Demand database. They can be deleted at the time clock, with authorized access, and through the Attendance on Demand service by an authorized system user. Templates are included in production backups of Attendance on Demand customer databases. Attendance on Demand will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from an individual’s Templates and shall only disclose, re-disclose or disseminate an individual’s Templates with necessary consents or as may be required by law.
Routine Maintenance of Biometric Data
Customers are responsible for complying with applicable standards and laws. For example, under the Illinois law, customers must delete an individual’s biometric data when the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining the data has been satisfied or within three years of the individual’s last interaction with the customer, whichever occurs first. When an employment relationship ends, the customer terminates the employee through the Attendance on Demand service by changing the employee’s status. The customer should also delete the Template when the employee’s status is set to Terminated. This causes the Template to be deleted from the Attendance on Demand database and the time clock (at the time clock’s next synchronization).
Maintenance and Storage of Backups and Archives
Backups of active customer databases are automated and take place on an incremental hourly, daily, weekly and quarterly basis. These production backups are kept for a maximum of one year. After one year, they are destroyed.
Authorized support personnel from Attendance on Demand, Inc. may occasionally backup or copy a system for the purposes of testing and troubleshooting. It is Attendance on Demand’s policy that these backups be deleted when they are no longer needed. As a precaution, all manual backups are destroyed after one year.
Attendance on Demand, Inc. archives databases of clients that are no longer using the Attendance on Demand service. As part of the archive process, all Templates are deleted.
Security of Biometric Information
Attendance on Demand, Inc. takes great care with all employee data, including Templates and such care is within the reasonable standard of care for this industry. Attendance on Demand stores, transmits, and protects the Templates in a manner that is the same or more protective than it stores, transmits, and protects other confidential or sensitive information. Templates are transmitted with encryption. Access to employee information is protected through access rights and password authorization. Biometric information cannot be imported or exported from the system. In addition, Attendance on Demand’s hosting environment and backup storage are protected from unauthorized access by physical and digital security measures.
This Attendance on Demand, Inc. Biometric Information Policy should not be construed as legal advice. Contact your legal counsel for clarification and/or advice regarding this and other state laws and regulations.
