•    Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;

•    Communicate with you about the Site and the Services.
We process your personal data because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with
the best service, to verify your identity, and to comply with fraud and money laundering laws.
Such processing is also a contractual requirement for you to use our services. Without such
processing, you will not be able to use our services. Your personal data is protected by legal
rights which are detailed in Section 8.
2.2   We receive and store certain types of information automatically, such as whenever you

identifier. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our
website, including pages accessed and links clicked. We may use identifiers to recognize you
when you arrive at the Site via an external link, such as a link appearing on a third party site.
We process your personal information in order to satisfy our legitimate interest of enhancing
security, monitoring and verifying identity or service access, combating spam or other
malware or security risks and to comply with applicable security laws and regulations.
Without processing your personal information, we may not be able to ensure the security of
our Services. We collect some of this information using cookies – please see Cookies in
Section 9 for further information.
Providing Your Personal Data to Others
3.1   We may disclose your information to our third party service providers and other organizations
for the purposes of providing services to us or directly to you on our behalf. We will never
sell or rent your personal information. When we use third party service providers, we only
disclose to them any personal information that is necessary for them to provide their service
and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to
use it other than in accordance with our specific instructions. We will only share your
information with the following providers under the following circumstances:
•    We may share your information with Thomson Reuters, and Onfido, companies located
in the United States, for identity verification services in order to prevent fraud. This
allows us to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public
records and other third party databases. These service providers may create derivative
data based on your personal information that can be used solely in connection with
provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services.
•    We may share your information with Google, Mailchimp, Postmark, Intercom,
DoubleClick, and Facebook, companies located in the United States, to help us with
parts of our business operations such as marketing, and technology services. Our
contracts require these service providers to only use your information in connection with
the services they perform for us, and prohibit them from selling your information to
anyone else.
•    We may also disclose your personal data to our auditors, lawyers, accountants,
consultants and other professional advisors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the
purposes of obtaining professional advice or managing legal disputes and risks.
3.2   We may also transfer your personal information if we are under a duty to disclose or share it
in order to comply with any legal obligation to detect or report a crime, to enforce or apply
the terms of our contracts or to protect the rights, property or safety of our visitors and
customers. However, we will always take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy
rights continue to be protected.
Information We Receive from Others
4.1   We obtain information about you from public databases and ID verification partners,
Thomson Reuters, and Onfido, for purposes of verifying your identity. ID verification
partners use a combination of government records and publicly available information about
you to verify your identity. Such information includes your name, address, job role, public
employment profile, credit history, status on any sanctions lists maintained by public
authorities, and other relevant data. We obtain such information to comply with our legal
obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws. The basis for processing such data is
compliance with legal obligations. In some cases, we may process additional data about you
to ensure our Services are not used fraudulently or for other illicit activities. In such
instances, processing is necessary for us to continue to perform our contract with you and
others.

job responsibilities and these employees are required to treat this information as confidential.

of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we
will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling

the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. If you are a EU

work or the place of the alleged infringement.

personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

identity of a user exercising his/her rights referred to in Sections 8.2 to 8.8 or if we otherwise
due to security reasons deem it necessary, we may request the provision of additional
information and otherwise use all reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of
the user.

how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how
you can prevent these cookies from being stored, however this may downgrade or break
certain elements of the sites functionality.
Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be

obtained from cookies. For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on
HTTP Cookies.
9.2   If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup

10. Automated Decision-Making and Information Collected Automatically
10.1  Automated decision making means the ability to make decisions using technology, without
human involvement. We may use automated decision making in processing your IP address
and unique user, or session, ID for load balancing to determine which backend server will
process the request. This information is required for us to perform your purchase contracts.
Please note that the automated decision making we use will not have a legal or similarly
significant effect on our users.
10.2   We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser,
including how you came to and used the Services; your IP address; device type and unique
device identification numbers, device event information (such as crashes, system activity and
hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and
referral URL), broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other
technical data collected through cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies that
uniquely identify your browser. We may also collect information about how your device has
interacted with our website, including pages accessed and links clicked. We may use
identifiers to recognize you when you arrive at the Site via an external link, such as a link
appearing on a third party site. We do not consider that this has any legal effect on you or
similarly significantly affects you.
10.3   You have the right to object to our use of automatically collected information described in
this section. You can do that by opting-out of cookies and similar technologies in accordance
with the method described above. If you do not want us to process your actual IP address

website, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a free service such as Tor.
11. Children’s Privacy
