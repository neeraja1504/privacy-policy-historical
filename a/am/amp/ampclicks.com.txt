Information Processed on Behalf of Our Partners

adMarketplace's network places ads to consumers who visit our Publisher’s websites. We may obtain anonymous information such as visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, general geographic data and browser type, by processing personal data such as cookies, pixels and IP addresses.

These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.
The use of IP addresses is to ensure ads are running in the allowed geos, to better place ads, and flag fraudulent traffic. Cookies may be used to track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher website.
