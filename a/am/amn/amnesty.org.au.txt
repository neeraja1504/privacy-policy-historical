Privacy statement - Amnesty International Australia
Your privacy is extremely important. Amnesty International Australia is committed to respecting your privacy and upholding the security of your personal information, so you can feel confident when interacting with our vital human rights work.
This Privacy Statement sets out what personal information we collect and why, and how we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information.
When you provide personal or sensitive information to us you have an opportunity to register whether you consent to that information being collected, used and disclosed as set out in this Privacy Statement.
Remember, we are here to help with any queries. If you have further questions after reading this Privacy Statement, please get in touch with our Supporter Relations team (details below).
What information we collect
Personal information
Personal information is information about an identified individual. We collect personal information about individuals including members, supporters, volunteers, contractors, job applicants and people whose human rights we work to protect. The information collected and held generally includes your name, address, date of birth, and contact details (such as your phone numbers, fax number and email address). We also use ‘cookies’ to track visits to our website and encourage you to return to them; you can disable cookies in your internet browsing settings.
You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However if you do not provide us with your personal information, it will be difficult for us to contact you. For example, without your personal information we may not be able to issue you with a receipt, offer you employment, respond to your request for assistance, or provide you with more information about Amnesty’s work.
Sensitive information
Sensitive information may include information about ethnic origin, political opinion or philosophical belief. Amnesty may collect and hold sensitive information in order to provide some services. For example, we may collect your ethnic origin if you are a case-work client, and some may view support of international human rights law as a political or philosophical belief. Amnesty will only collect sensitive information directly from you. By providing it to us you consent to us collecting, using or disclosing it as specified by this Privacy Statement or as otherwise authorised by law.
How we collect personal information
We collect personal information you provide to us directly, for example, in person, over the phone, by email, through our website or by completing our online or hard-copy petition forms. We may also collect your personal information from publicly available sources, from SMS and other electronic means and from third parties. In the event that we collected your personal information from a third party, we will notify you of that fact.
During your communications with us, please do not provide us with personal or sensitive information of any other individual unless you have the express consent of that individual to do so. If you do provide us with such information about another individual, you:
must tell that individual that you will be providing their information to us and that we will handle their information in accordance with this Privacy Statement
must provide that individual with a copy of (or refer them to) this Privacy Statement
warrant that you have that individual's consent to provide their information to us.
Use of personal information
We use personal information you provide us for the purpose for which it was provided to us, for other related purposes or as permitted or required by law. Such purposes include:
processing donations, memberships and Human Rights Defender pledges
issuing receipts
responding to your comments or questions
providing follow-up information about Amnesty’s activities
supporter research, for example asking you to participate in a survey about your involvement with Amnesty
requesting financial or activism support
improving our website
measuring the level of support received and the effectiveness of our campaigns
providing you with marketing material such as our newsletter (if you opt-in to receive such information)
any other purposes identified at the time of collecting your information.
If we also obtain your sensitive information, we will only use your sensitive information (such as your ethnic origin or health information) for the purposes listed above, or other directly-related purposes or purposes to which you consent.
Disclosure of personal information
Any personal information you provide to us may be disclosed, if appropriate, to third parties who provide services on our behalf, such as mail, database, telephone, IT, audit, professional advice, payment processing and research services. We may also disclose your personal information to our volunteers who assist with many of our tasks. From time to time we send personal information to suppliers who are based overseas, such as cloud storage suppliers. The overseas locations of these suppliers include North America, Europe and Asia.
Our suppliers are required by us to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. We have confidentiality agreements in place with many of our service providers and external agencies, and with staff and volunteers who handle personal information that we provide to them. We will only disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it was initially collected, other directly-related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.
Other than as stated above, we will we not share your personal information. Though unlikely, it is possible that we might be forced to disclose personal information in response to legal process or in good faith when the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request.
Data security
We are committed to protecting your data. We take commercially-reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse, loss, interference and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, whenever we ask for your financial details online, we use security-encrypted response forms and your information is held in secure servers.
However, data protection and security measures are never completely secure and, despite the measures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. You must take care to protect your personal information (for example, by protecting any usernames and passwords) and you should notify us as soon as possible of any security breaches. If you do not wish to make your financial contribution online, please contact us to receive a hard-copy form.

List swapping
Occasionally we allow other like-minded organisations to use your data to contact you with information that might be of interest to you. We will always obtain your express consent for your personal information to be disclosed to a like-minded organisation for this purpose. If we receive your data from another like-minded organisation, we will inform you where we got your information from and obtain your consent to continue to be contacted by Amnesty.
Accuracy, access and correction
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect and hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us of any changes to your personal information to help us maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date information.
We will, on request, provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you unless otherwise required or permitted by law. We will notify you of the basis for any denial of access to your personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period after the request is made.
