Personal Data Collected
AMI defines Personal data as any data about an identified or identifiable natural person, or any information that in combination with other non-personal information can reasonably be used to identify a natural person.
As a part of AMI’s standard business operations with your company, AMI collects personal data, so it may provide services, respond to requests, offer customer support, and fulfill legal, contractual or financial obligations to your company. The type of personal data AMI collects from you depends upon the type of interactions you have with AMI websites and services, including the context of your interactions with AMI, the choices you make (including privacy settings) as well as the products and services you use.
You may choose to voluntarily give personal data to AMI directly in a variety of methods such as through our websites, products, online services, software, apps, tools, and other online and offline services and functionality we provide. When you subscribe to a newsletter, create an account, make a purchase or request information from AMI, we will ask for information related to your business, such as contact name, email address, phone number, company name, billing address, shipping address communication information, company financial information and account ID or credentials in order to fulfill your request. If you attend a trade show or marketing event, or otherwise contact us, you may also voluntarily provide similar personal data.
We may also collect information relating to your use of our websites and our services through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our websites, we may log certain information that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring web site addresses. We may collect information about the pages you view within our websites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, some of our services include technologies that allow us to collect certain information about product use.
We may also collect information that pertains to your company, from other sources, such as vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired and that we have the right to obtain it from them before we use it.
Security Measures
AMI protects the personal data you provide us. Access to personal data is limited to people who need it to perform their job functions and have a need to know. Authorized third-party agents may also need access to some of the personal data. For example, if AMI needs to ship products to customers, it shares the customer's name and address with the shipping company. AMI only provides third-party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested transaction.
How We Use Your Personal Data
We collect and use your personal data to operate our business; for example, to perform accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation, and collection activities. Other business purposes that depend on use of your personal information include crime or fraud monitoring and prevention, protecting our legal rights, and performing contractual obligations.
