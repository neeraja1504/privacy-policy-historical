Internal research and analysis: We carry out research and analysis on our customers to determine the success of campaigns and promotions, better understand behavior and responses and identify patterns and trends. This helps inform our approach and make RLH Corporation a stronger and more effective organization. Understanding our customers, their interests, and what they care about also helps us provide a better experience.
Analysis and grouping: We analyze the data we collect about customers to identify common characteristics and preferences. We do this by assessing various types of information including behavior, for example, previous activity or demographic information, such as age or location. This allows us to ensure you receive the communications, products and information which are most important to you.
Profiling to help us understand our customers: We profile customers on the basis of various criteria including their interests, general geographic location, website/app activity and socioeconomic and age groups. At times, we may also use aggregated, anonymized lifestyle data obtained from third parties to supplement our profiles.
