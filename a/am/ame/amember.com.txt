Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit CGI-Central’s web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
This website uses Google AdWords
This website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the [CLIENT NAME] website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can
opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or
permanently using a browser plugin.

In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
Information We Collect
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and/or a set of numbers, that serve as that computer’s “Internet Protocol” IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any web page within CGI-Central, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor’s domain name and/or IP address. The domain name and/or IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of CGI-Central, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also “Disclosure to Third Parties” below. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals.
CGI-Central may offer access to services that require registration. In that event, your registration and/or contact information may be used to send notification to you of CGI-Central products and/or services by e-mail. We maintain a strict “No-Spam” policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.
When you use co-branded services or those provided by a third party within CGI-Central, your Personal Information may be passed to that third party provider. Its use of your Personal Information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.
We are using Google Remarketing
We use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender, and interests to better understanding the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.
