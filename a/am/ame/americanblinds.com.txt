When you place an order or register on our site, we require you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information (when ordering products only). We may also require you to create a username and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each user, as well as provide a more efficient method for users to submit information to americanblinds.com when placing an order or a request for product information. When you order a product and/or register, we also give you the option of submitting personal information such as your phone number, gender, date of birth, and/or other information. This allows us to know you better and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you. When registering with our site, you are also given a choice whether you would like to be on our mailing list, or whether you would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature at our site, we may again ask for your name, address, username and password so that we are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.

We utilize third-party companies to perform certain functions for us. Examples include order fulfillment, package delivery, the sending of emails and direct mail, data analysis, marketing optimization programs, credit card processing, etc. These third parties are given only the data that they need to perform the function that they are engaged in, and are not allowed to use it for any other purpose. We may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to comply with applicable laws, subpoenas, or court orders.
We do make our customer postal mailing list available to other reputable organizations from time to time. You may opt out of this process by going to our registration section.
In the event of a merger or acquisition, your information may be transferred to the successor entity.
