Privacy Policy | AmeriMark
Welcome to our website, operated by AmeriMark Direct LLC ("AmeriMark," "we," or "our") and located at www.amerimark.com.
We value our customers and are committed to protecting their privacy and informing them as to how their personal information will be used. We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests and promotions. We recognize that we must maintain and use customer information responsibly. We have created this Privacy Policy to address our practices regarding information collected from visitors to the Site.
This Privacy Policy only addresses information collected directly through or from the Site - it does not address or govern any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected from you (sometimes referred to as a "visitor," "user," "you," or "your") other than directly through or from the Site, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our  Terms of Use, which must be reviewed and accepted by you as a condition of use of the Site. The Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. It does not knowingly collect personal information online from visitors in this age group, and will delete information from a person in that age group as quickly as possible upon receipt of notice that such information has been collected.
If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Contact Customer Service form or by telephone at 1-877-268-9594.
Collection of Information
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of the Site. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We receive and store any information you submit to us through our Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information (as addressed below), but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. For example, if you make a purchase using a credit card, we will need to collect information such as your credit card number and billing address to complete that transaction.
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Our authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may also collect and display the total counts that page has been viewed. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages of the Site are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We do not override these settings or options, including any "Do Not Track" settings. However, if you utilize the aforementioned privacy features, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits on the Site.

If you access a third party website from a link on this Site, any information you disclose on that website is not subject to this Privacy Policy. It is possible that these links may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites, advertisers, or third parties or the content of such websites and it is your sole obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites.

It is solely your obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites, advertisers and any third parties.
Third Party Ads
We use third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our Site, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. This anonymous information is collected through the use of pixel tags or similar technologies which are industry standard technologies used by most major web sites. You can also read more about online marketing practices and the technologies that support them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's website. If you would like to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, check out Network Advertising.org.
In addition, we may from time to time contract with third party vendors to serve ads to our customers on our behalf across the Internet or to send our catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. To do this, the vendors will collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our products and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie or pixel tag - industry standard technology used by most major Web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. They may also pool the anonymous information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving a catalog.
If you do not wish for cookies or pixel tags to be placed on your computer, most commercially available web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place. To opt-out of receiving our catalogs, you may send us an email at custserv@amerimark.com or call us at 1-877-268-9594.
We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services. No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Site is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 18.

Accordingly, we urge you to review this Privacy Policy at the start of each use of this Site. We will also list the date of the last revision at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.
Confidentiality and Security
We use modern technology to protect the information you submit. All personally identifiable user information is stored on secured servers and behind a firewall. However, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We are not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.
