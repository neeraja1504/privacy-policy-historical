Your Security
RentPath, Inc. has taken the following important measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. First, we store no financial information or social security information on our site. The personal data we do store on our system is protected by firewall and password. Our network firewall is a combination of hardware and software designed to keep unauthorized users from accessing our network. The password you select, along with your unique email address, prevents others from accessing your information. We suggest that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
Third Party Service Providers
Some of the services available are provided by third parties that have their own privacy policies that may be different than ours. You should review the privacy policy of third parties before providing your personal information to them.

We take great care to require that these business partners agree by contract not to use any member information that they may receive access to. RentPath, Inc. may contract with outside companies to administer our mailing lists or provide retail services. Your personal information may be shared with an outside company for the sole purpose of administering the products, services and programs you have selected.
