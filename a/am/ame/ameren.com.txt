Privacy | Ameren - Ameren.com
Through your use of our Site and Services, we may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information:
Personal Information is information or a combination of information that identifies or relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, household, or business.  Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your first and last name, home or business address, email address, and telephone number, and information that could be considered Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) or Sensitive Personal Information (“SPI”).  We may also combine the Personal Information that we collect on our Site with information we collect about you offline.  An IP address may or may not constitute Personal Information depending upon the jurisdiction.  For the purposes of this definition, IP addresses are not included.
Anonymous Information is information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual.
Using the information collected, we may pool Personal Information, Anonymous Information, or both, in a manner that produces a separate type of information - Aggregate Information - which cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual person, household, or business.  For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular ZIP code.
As part of the Services you choose to use, Ameren may collect certain Personal Information.  For example, we may collect Personal Information when you create or modify an online account, complete a self-service transaction with us online, or provide us with Personal Information in correspondence. This may also include any of your questions, comments, or suggestions submitted through our Site or if you fill out a survey.
When you voluntarily provide us with a cell phone number on our Site, you are giving us express written consent to use that number for the purpose indicated, or if given with regard to your utility account or other account with us, express written consent to communicate information to you related to your account, so long as you have not given us instructions to the contrary. You may revoke this consent at any time by any reasonable method, including telephone contact with the appropriate Ameren Company or by making adjustments to your account settings online. Your consent to be contacted by us is not required in order to receive our Services.
Chat is a voluntary online service that allows customers of an Ameren Company to speak with customer service representatives of Ameren about their account.  While the Ameren Companies have taken commercially reasonable efforts, including the execution of contractual arrangements with third-parties intended to provide security measures commensurate with those provided by the Ameren Companies, as with any online service, there is some level of risk when communicating over the Internet. In using Chat, you understand that the information that you submit via a Chat session may be documented and retained by Ameren’s third-party Chat provider. While Ameren is committed to your privacy and has made commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the information you submit via Chat remains confidential, we cannot guarantee that such information will remain inaccessible. If you choose to use the Chat function provided through the third-party provider, you disclaim any claims against the Ameren Companies, its employees, or its agents arising out of the information shared.
