How We Use Your Information
The primary use for Your information is to provide You with services You have requested and/or paid for. We also use Your information to deliver customized services to You. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively is used in order to customize Our marketing efforts or to customize the use of Our Site for an aggregate group of customers.

We also use Your information for market research purposes – in order to increase Your (and other Users’) experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target potential new markets, and for other marketing or statistical purposes.
We also use Your information for the obvious purpose of providing Your User profile to all of Our other Members and Visitors. When You create a profile, You should consider all of the information on the profile to be public information and therefore, accessible by anyone, unless otherwise stated. Confidential information in Your profile cannot be viewed by others or the public. Confidential information includes Your name, physical address, and billing information. Nevertheless, Your profile information, pictures, and videos as well as Your city, state, and country will be public information. Although Your personally identifying information will not be made public, You should understand that there is a possibility that You may be identified through the information provided on Your profile. For example, You may be visually recognized by someone who sees Your picture, or Your description may be adequately detailed to the extent that someone may be able to identify You. Accordingly, You understand that using this Site places You in control of all information displayed on Your profile, and You take full responsibility for any consequences for whatever information You choose to publish. We also reserve the right to post Your profile and any of the public information or images contained therein, on any of the websites within Our network. Additionally, should any of Our websites undergo new ownership, You profile may be part and parcel any related sale.

Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals We are unable to guarantee that Our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.
