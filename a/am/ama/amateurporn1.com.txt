7. What are your rights regarding our processing of your personal data?
Access, rectification, restriction and erasure
You can always send us a message to ask what personal data is stored of you or ask us to rectify, restrict or remove your personal data. Since our storage of personal data is minimal, and almost all our data is anonymized and aggregated, we cannot gaurantee that we have your data on file. As explained before, when data is anonymized, it is not considered personal data.
If you sent us an e-mail, we can retrieve that e-mail if we still have it on our mailservers. If so, we cannot rectifiy any data in that e-mail, since e-mails cannot be changed. We can delete any e-mail on request. The same goes for messages you send us through other mediums.
Please note that we might have legitimate rights to continue processing your personal data, which override your interest, rights and freedoms regarding our processing of such data. For example, we might be obligated to continue processing your personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or we need to retain such data for other legal purposes. We will always inform you of this decision when you contact us with a request to exercise one of your rights stated in this section.
Data portability
The data we process is minimal, and mostly aggregated and anonymized. You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you in an interoperable format, so you can transmit that data to another service provider. We cannot guarantee that we have your personal data on file and/or in an interoparble format, but we will do our best to assist you in enforcing your right regarding data portability.
Withdrawing consent
As explained in our paragraph on cookies, you can withdraw consent by deleting your cookies. You can contact us with your request to withdraw consent for any personal data you provided to us via certain interactions with our site, such as using a specific website feature or sending (e-mail) messages.
