Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
AtomPark Software Inc. does use the services of third parties, such as email service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtomPark Software Inc. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose AtomPark Software Inc. specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the AtomPark Software Inc.'s affiliates for their use without your approval.
AtomPark Software Inc. may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AtomPark Software Inc. may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Privacy Policy or End User License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining AtomPark Software Inc.'s products.
In the event that all or substantially all of AtomPark Software Inc.'s stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AtomPark Software Inc. may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Choices Available to You
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the AtomPark Software Inc. Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtomPark Software Inc. or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information.

We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our End User License Agreement.
AtomPark Software Inc. is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.
