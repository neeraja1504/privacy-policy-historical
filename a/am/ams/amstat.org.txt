Privacy Statement
Last Updated July, 2019
The ASA has a strong commitment to privacy, balanced by the recognition that we are a public association. This statement discloses policies and procedures concerning information gathering and dissemination practices for www.amstat.org, other websites controlled by the ASA, and for data collected through email communications with ASA members and customers.
User Information
Users of this website may differ in their access or needs. We recommend you read this policy in its entirety to understand your and our responsibilities. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our website.
The information in this statement is summarized into two broad headings: customer information and member information. Members who place orders should also read the customer information section.

Customer Information
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect customers’ contact information (e.g., name and email address) and financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers). Financial information is used to bill the customer for products and services. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our association, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers . This contact information also is used to get in touch with customers when necessary. Customers may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section below.
Additionally, we collect data automatically when we communicate with members and customers by email. We use third-party analytics services to collect behavioral and operational data, which may be recorded and retained in web logs and other ASA systems. Examples of data we collect this way include:
The emails you open and links you click in those emails
The times and dates you open our emails and the duration of such interaction
The email client you used to read our emails
We use this data to provide customized digital experiences, as well as for market research, marketing, analytics, and system administration purposes. For example, we may use this data to determine whether you’ve previously opened an email, to store your preferences and settings, or to target relevant content to you.

Members’ contact information is made available through the Member Directory. Members’ contact information is sometimes shared with other organizations that promote statistics or professional development of statisticians.

Cookie Information
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a simple text file stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Most websites use cookies to improve your experience by allowing the website to “remember” you, either for the duration of your visit (using a “session cookie”) or for repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or they may be set by other websites that run content on the page you are viewing (“third-party cookies”).
What do cookies do?
Cookies perform different functions, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, even after you log in, the site won’t recognize you or be able to keep you logged in if you move to another page.
How does the American Statistical Association use cookies?
The American Statistical Association uses different types of cookies to enhance and improve your experience. By continuing to browse our site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. The American Statistical Association uses the following types of cookies:
