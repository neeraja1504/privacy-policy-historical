Personal information
The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you. You are free to visit Smarthinking; however, if you would like to use the Smarthinking service, you must register. When you register with us, we will request certain personal information including email, phone number, ZIP/postal code, country and, if your school does not provide the Smarthinking service to you, credit card information. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary and not required for receipt of services.
This information is used by Smarthinking for (1) billing and account purposes; (2) demographic assessments of and provision of services to the user population; (3) empirical research; (4) communication with you; and (5) internal auditing purposes. Only strictly authorized Smarthinking employees have access to this personal information. It may be given to an institutional administrator or a professor if the service is provided through your school or by a textbook publisher.
In addition to registration information, all electronic text-based conversations between you and Smarthinking’s tutors are digitally captured and stored in Smarthinking’s databases. They may be given to your school administrator, professor, and empirical researchers. Smarthinking may request personal information at other times to better serve your individual needs. As stated above, Smarthinking will not collect any personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily provide. Smarthinking will not disclose any of your personal information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Registration Agreement or the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any content on Smarthinking violates the rights of third parties, (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Smarthinking, its users or the public, or (v) respond to the request of your institutional administrators if the service is paid for by them.
Your schools' administrators are within their rights to request access to your personal information and electronic conversations with Smarthinking tutors. Your school, in turn, is subject to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Acts of 1974 (FERPA) restrictions on further disclosure. For further information on FERPA rules and responsibilities, contact your school.
Smarthinking also reserves the right to replicate written comments about the service sent to its representatives on our website and/or in promotional materials and/or in business development materials, along with your name and institution. Your email address and any personal information besides your name and institution will not be used at any time without your agreement. If you do not want your name to accompany your comments, please state this in your written correspondence with Smarthinking, Inc. and its representatives.
Smarthinking contains links to other sites and some features of the Smarthinking Service may be offered in conjunction with a partner company. Smarthinking is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and companies.
In order to provide partner company features, it may be necessary for either you or Smarthinking to share your voluntarily provided personal information with this company. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.
