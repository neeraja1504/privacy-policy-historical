As we are a Luxembourg based company, we comply with the EU Data Protection Regulation commonly called "GDPR" (If you want to learn more you can check:  EU Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC), which provides a high level of protection of your personal data.
In the course of the operation and exploitation of the site and the provision of the services, your personal information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") to third parties data processors for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.
If we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, we endeavor to ensure that your rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of your personal data are adequately and appropriately protected. For this purpose, we utilize the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission that you can find here.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We did our best to explain what your rights are and how you can exercise them. If, despite of our below explanations, you are still unsure about the actions you can take or the conditions of exercise of your rights, do not worry, our Support Team will provide you with all the assistance you need when exercising your rights.
You may also contact us, at any time, before exercising any of your rights, and we will reply to your request as quickly as possible.
Please note that we created a specific interface called "Privacy Rights" in your account settings in order for you to be able to easily exercise your rights.
Our Support Team will provide you with information on actions taken within 30 days of when we receive your request. Only in exceptional circumstances, when we face complex or a high number of requests, we may extend this period of response up to 60 days.
Please note that rights may be exercised free of charge. However, unfounded or excessive requests, in particular because of their repetitive character, will lead to the payment of a fee.
Data access and data portability
You have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you by requesting a copy of your personal data free of charge through the "Data Download" section in your account settings.
Upon verification of your identity, your request will be sent to our Support Team.
If we consider that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, because you requested a copy of your data numerous times in a short period of time), we may refuse to act or charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs for providing you the information.
In certain cases, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). For this purpose, you can send an email to privacy@awempire.com.
Rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data
You have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal data.
For this purpose, you can send an email to privacy@awempire.com.
Data retention and erasure
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations.
If you no longer want us to use your information, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your model account. In such case, please select "Forget my Data" in the "Privacy Rights" section of your account settings.
Your request will be sent to our Support Team who will contact you to learn more about your request. However, if you face any difficulties, please contact us at any time.
Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We might retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we close or suspend your account for fraud or illegal activities, we may retain certain information about you to prevent you from opening a new account in the future. Such information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial proceedings/and or investigations.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations. Please note that according to Luxembourg legislation financial related information shall be kept for a period of ten years.
Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
In order to protect our site and your personal information from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, we have backup systems. Residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
Right to object
We process your data for a variety of reasons as explained in "WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?". Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes.
In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.
Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop processing your data for any direct marketing activities that we may do by sending an email to privacy@awempire.com.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved.
Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:
If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.
You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.
You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.
We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR).
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our services and the way we handle your personal information or changes in the applicable laws.
If we make changes we consider important, we will let you know by placing a notice on the relevant app/site and/or contact you using other methods such as email.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, such changes will be applicable from the time they are published on our site, unless we specify a date of entry into force. Your continued use of our site from that day on will be subject to the new Privacy Policy.
