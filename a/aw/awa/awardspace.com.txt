This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, browser plug-ins, screen resolution, window size, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, landing page, and referring URL. To collect this information, a cookie may be saved on your computer or device when you visit our Services. Cookies contain a small amount of information that allows our web servers to recognize you.

Any personal data gathered on these platforms is only in response to users interacting out of their own will with our marketing pages. The contact is deemed as a legitimate business inquiry. The personal contact data is removed from the social media platform once the user has requested its removal.
2. Analytics
Our services use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use our website. We anonymize this data at the point of collection and automatically delete user and event data that is older than two years. Google provides some additional privacy options regarding its Analytics cookies at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
3. Registering with third-party accounts

Legal basis for processing personal information
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only:
* where we have your consent to do so;
* where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights;
* where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you.
We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you when necessary to provide these Services. In example, when improving our platform, undertaking marketing, responding to your queries, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
In case we need you to provide personal information to us to perform a contract with you or to comply with a legal requirement, we will make this clear at the relevant time and explain whether your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
Third-party services
You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible in any way for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.
Securing your data
We are committed to protecting your data and personal information. We employ a variety of security measures and technologies, that are designed to defend against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. However, we aim to provide a level of security that can cover the possible risks when processing your personal information.
Keeping your data
We keep personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable tax, accounting, or legal requirements).
If we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either anonymize or delete it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Management over the data we have for you
If you have registered with us, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing us at privacy@supportindeed.com. If you choose to terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.
To protect your privacy and security, we may have to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could:
* inhibit our ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims;
* inhibit our ability to comply with a legal obligation;
* result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or
* result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to us or a third party.
General data protection regulation (GDPR) and your data protection rights
If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:
* You can **object to the processing** of your personal information, ask us to **restrict the processing** of your personal information, or **request portability** of your personal information at any time by emailing us [privacy@supportindeed.com](mailto:privacy@supportindeed.com).
* You can **access** , **correct** , **update** , or **request deletion** of your personal information at any time by emailing us at [privacy@supportindeed.com](mailto:privacy@supportindeed.com).
* You can **withdraw your consent** at any time (see our Cookie Policy), if we have collected or process your personal information with your consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
* You can **opt-out of our marketing communications** that we send you at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails you receive from us. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing [privacy@supportindeed.com](mailto:privacy@supportindeed.com).

If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our Services, by email, or other communication means.
International transfer of data
We are a global business, so we may transfer personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected.
