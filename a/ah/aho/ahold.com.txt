Koninklijke Ahold N.V. (“Ahold”), its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (together “Ahold Companies”) appreciate your interest in their products and services and your visit to this website (the "Site") and the sites of the Ahold Companies. To the extent any discrepancy exists between the respective privacy policies as applicable to such sites and this Privacy Policy, those policies prevail. We intend to give you as much control as possible over your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and it is important to us that you feel comfortable with visiting the Site. Any Personal Information that you give us, including but not limited to your email address, may be used in the following ways. If you give us Personal Information in order to receive information from us - for instance when submitting requests for annual reports or other information on Ahold Companies - we may collect and store your information as it enables us to fulfill your information request. We may also use that Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes. If you do not want it to be used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt-out" by emailing your request to us (at communications@ahold.com). Ahold sometimes sells a business to another company. Such sale could include the transfer of your Personal Information directly related to that business to the buyer. We will release Personal Information, to the extent required by law. Except as described in the previous sentence, Ahold will not sell or willfully provide your Personal Information to third parties who are not our subsidiaries, joint venture partners or associates allowing them to use your Personal Information for their own purposes. We will not share any Personal Information you provide, such as credit card information, with other parties, unless it is needed to handle your request, process your invoice or prevent or combat fraud. The Site may contain links to websites that are not related to Ahold Companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the owners of such websites.
