COOKIES
Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us PI, you agree that your PI may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your PI may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws of such countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your PI, e.g. by obtaining from the PI recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses. ITN has a security program intended to keep the PI stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the PI you send over the Internet. PI may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our service providers to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your PI from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your PI to those employees, agents, contractors and other service providers who have a business need to know. They will only process your PI on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected PI breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
OTHER WEBSITES
If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, ITN’s privacy policy does not apply.
CHILDREN
ITN does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
THIRD-PARTY MARKETING
Under certain circumstances set by applicable law, you are entitled to:
Request access to your PI (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the PI we hold about you and to check correctness and integrity of PI. The disclosure might be limited to the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable request. You may also request to furnish you with:
the categories of sources from which PI is collected;
the business or commercial purposes for collecting of PI;
the categories of third parties with whom we share your PI;
the categories of PI we have disclosed for a business purpose.
Request correction of the PI that we hold about you. This enables you to request any incomplete or inaccurate PI to be corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new PI you provide to us.
Request to delete. You are able to submit verifiable request and ask us to delete your PI. Please, be aware, there are some cases, when we might reject your request (e.g. when we shall comply with legal obligation or complete a transaction requested by you).
Request to opt out from PI sales. Such requests shall be submitted through the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” website.
Due to the remote nature of our services, it is important for us to keep communicating through the same email (Verified Email), which was used by you to request a price quote or purchase air tickets and other related services. The Verified Email is the key communication channel for us, so we can give quick answers and not to divulge your data to any malicious person. You might also submit request through the voice call, but still we must use the Verified Email to reply, due to law requirements and in order to protect our legal claims. NONDISCRIMINATION:  We shall not discriminate (deny services, charge different prices, provide different levels of quality) against you because you exercised any of the rights set herein. This right might be limited in case, if  the difference in prices or levels or quality is reasonably related to the value provided to you by your PI.   We might obtain your opt-in consent and provide to you financial incentives, so you agree to provide additional PI or not to request the deletion of your PI. FEES and DENIALS: You will not have to pay a fee to access your PI (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive (more than twice in a 12-month period) or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We might also refuse to act on your request, when we are not in a position to identify you and verify your request. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your PI (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that PI is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you (via email, phone or messenger) to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. TERMS: We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. The maximum response time shall not exceed 90 days. CONTACTS: you can submit your complaint/ request to DPO email (see above) or by filling the Request Form.
OPTING OUT
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by contacting us at any time.

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Platforms after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.
CHANGE OF PURPOSE
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
ITN USES TRACKING TOOLS SUCH AS COOKIES
We (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Web sites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.
We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter. When you access a partner site within our mobile applications, we may track your activity on that site.
By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.
ITN uses tracking tools for following purposes

To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Platforms, such as language.
To make use of cross-device tracking in order to optimize our advertising activities.

HOW YOU CAN CONTROL TRACKING TOOLS AND OPT-OUT OF ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING
Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information. Your opt out choice is stored in opt out cookies only in that browser, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers, computers, or devices you may use. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt out preferences may not be effective. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you should visit this page periodically to review your preferences. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.
