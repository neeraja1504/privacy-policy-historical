a s t r o n o m i c s . c o m [Our privacy policy]
|  Our privacy policy is very simple. We will not sell, rent, lease, or give away to any other party any information that you may choose to give us. We will not automatically collect any personal information from your computer when you visit our web site. Your visits to our website are totally anonymous. If you want us to know who you are, or anything about you, you will have to tell us on the e-mail list, catalog request, registration page, or order forms provided.
If you request a catalog on our website, your name and address will be stored for one year in our internal database. If you do not order anything from us within one year, your name and address will be deleted automatically from the database.
We won't send you unsolicited e-mails. If you want to receive news of new products, sales, and so forth, you will have to sign up on our e-mail list. If you do choose to sign up, you will not be bombarded with e-mail. We will only send out occasional messages of genuine interest - new products, limited time sales, manufacturers' rebates, etc.
We will not bore you with trivia. Should you ever decide to unsubscribe, and we hope you won't, you can do so by following the "remove" link located at the bottom of each list-mail we send.
Oh, one other thing. We won't invade your privacy while you're on our website by throwing ads at you while you're browsing. We won't sell advertising space to make a few bucks off your visit.
So that's our privacy policy in a nutshell. And we'll never tell anybody who you are. We won't even know who you are until you choose to tell us. And we won't pester you with ads while you're on our site. If you have any questions about our policy, however, drop us an e-mail and we'll get you an answer as soon as possible.
