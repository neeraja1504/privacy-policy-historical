Privacy Policy - Astrodienst
Privacy Policy of www.astro.com / Astrodienst AG / Astro AG
About the information you give us
Astrodienst has been serving its customers around the world since 1980. Those customers entrust us with information which they expect to remain confidential. We take that trust seriously. The information you provide to Astrodienst is not made available to any other company or individual. It is used internally to process the orders you place with us, whether for a free service or when you are making a purchase.
Protection of personal data
Astrodienst has its own servers which are maintained by us. Nobody outside of Astrodienst has access to our software or data. The website uses encryption (TLSv.1.2) for security and to protect the transmission of confidential content. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. All pages that transmit personal data to our servers are encrypted in secure TLS mode. The data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
As the controller, the Astrodienst AG has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
Collection of personal data
If we require personal information from you, you will be asked to confirm that your details have been transmitted. By submitting your data you give us your consent to collect this data. In general, this data is requested when you create a horoscope, create a registered user profile or purchase a product from the AstroShop.
Use of personal data
The creation of a horoscope on our website requires the entry of birth data: time, date and place of birth, as well as at least one first name, which can also be a pseudonym.
The use of the services on this website is possible with an anonymous guest profile, which does not require any personal data other than birth data for the horoscope.
To create a registered user profile, the following data is recorded:
Your e-mail address, which also serves as your user name
Password
Title
Name and surname
Country
Language preferences
The following additional data is recorded for a purchase:
Address (complete postal address, postcode, city)
Phone number, Fax number (if any)
Your payment preferences, although we never have any knowledge of your credit card number
Any additional notifications you may have entered
Your personal data will be used for the following purposes:
To make it easier for you to use the website, you only need to enter your personal data once.
To deliver or activate a purchased product.
To ensure that only you have access to your chart data and online services.
In order to be able to invoice you when you make a purchase.
Deletion of your data
You can delete your data at any time in "My Astro", either individual birth data or the complete profile. Please note that when you delete a profile, any services such as subscriptions or E-horoscopes are also deleted and thus expire. You need your password to delete a registered user profile and the data it contains.
Deleting a profile does not mean that all data on the servers of Astrodienst is deleted. The data can no longer be accessed on the website, but will be stored for a period of six months before being irrevocably deleted. This is used to restore an erroneously deleted profile. If you wish to have your data deleted immediately and irrevocably, please contact us by email.
Retention of data during an order
The data that you transmit to us when placing an order is subject to retention due to our duty to preserve records. This period is 10 years for companies in Switzerland. All data relevant to an order - name, address, dates of birth, email, products, payment information etc. - will be stored by us during this period. This storage takes place independently of the website. This data cannot be deleted.
Credit card data is never stored by Astrodienst, not even during the payment transaction, which is processed by an external payment provider. We never know your credit card number or security number.
E-mails
The services and contents of this website can be used anonymously and without registration. However, a registered user profile offers the possibility to store up to 100 birth data and to connect to your data from different devices. A valid email address is required to create a registered user profile. By creating a registered user profile, you give us permission to send you e-mails.
If you have forgotten your password or want to set a new one, the corresponding link will be sent to this address. We may also occasionally send you an email to this address informing you of the delivery status of a product you have requested, an innovation in a service you have requested or an innovation on the website, for example. It is not possible to use a registered user profile on www.astro.com and at the same time to cancel these emails completely, as they are regarded as an essential part of the service requested by you.
Your email address will be treated confidentially and will not be passed on to third parties.
We send out a few newsletters a year. Sending is done via our own servers. No personal tracking is carried out. Newsletters sent by us contain a link to unsubscribe from the mailing list.
Use of cookies
This website uses cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies serve to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website.
You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser.

Forum posts
The contributions in the Astro-Forum are public and accessible to everyone. Before publication, carefully check that they do not contain any information that is not intended for the public. Although we do not allow any search engines in the forum, you must expect that your contributions will be recorded by search engines that do not follow the rules and will also be accessible worldwide without specifically calling up our website. Deletion or correction of such search engine entries often cannot be enforced on foreign operators. Astrodienst has no claim to the deletion of this data.

Browser type and browser version
operating system used
referrer URL
Host name of the accessing computer
Time of the server request
This data is not assigned to specific persons, and it is not combined with other data sources. We reserve the right to check the data subsequently if we become aware of concrete indications of an illegal use.
Right to information, deletion, blocking
You have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing as well as a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given below if you have any further questions on the subject of personal data.
Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor
On this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.
The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.Ã .r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option in the online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.
The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.
The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.
The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
