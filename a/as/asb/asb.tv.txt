Airshowbuzz.com: Your Aviation Resource
We know people rarely read the fine print, but we thought we’d post it anyway. Without breaking out your magnifying glass, we’ll zealously guard your personal information and we’ll never compromise your integrity, or ours.
Last Updated: 11.7.08
1. Policy
Airshowbuzz, LLC ("ASB") has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices so that you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to this website (the "Site"). ASB respects the privacy of its users, and this Policy explains what information we collect on our Site and how we use such information. Please read this Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Rules of Engagement posted at the Site, which governs your use of the Site. Your use of our Site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Policy.
2. Applicability
Please note that this Policy only applies to this Site and any other site owned and/or operated by or for ASB upon which ASB has placed a "link" which, when "clicked," transfers you to this Policy. This Policy only covers information collected at this Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other site unless otherwise specifically stated or disclosed by ASB.
3. Information ASB Collects
(a) Personally Identifiable Information: Personal Information is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your first and last name, gender, phone number, address, birth date, e-mail address, and, if applicable, your credit card information), which we refer to in this Policy as "PI." Generally, you may browse our Site without providing us with PI. However, there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PI, such as when you choose to register with our Site; post a photo, video, or message; or participate in e-commerce, interactive, or promotional activities. You can change or update your PI by changing your account information. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information to enhance your experience. ASB reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Site that require you to register or otherwise provide additional PI. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Site's features. The PI you submit will be used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, and to notify you (if applicable) regarding any promotions or e-commerce activities. Your PI may also be used by us and any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, joint venturer, sponsor and/or partner of ASB (collectively, “Affiliated Third Parties”) to provide you with additional services. You may always direct us by “opting-out” at the point where we ask for PI, and we will not share or use PI in order to provide you with additional services. However, if you do not want us to share this information, we may not be able to provide you with the additional services. In such case, please use our unsubscribe page and we will not share such information. We will not share PI with entities that are not Affiliated Third Parties unless you give us express permission to do so by opting-in at the point where we ask for PI. ASB does not sell, rent or share PI collected with other people other than that specifically outlined herein.
(b) This is not a Site directed to children under the age of 13 and ASB does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age at the Site. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to ASB. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not use the ASB Site—there are lots of other great websites for you. Talk to your parents about what sites are appropriate for you.  If ASB learns that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Site with PI, ASB will delete that child's PI from its system.
(c) Anonymous Information: When you visit the Site, our web servers automatically collect Site usage information. Site usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, and the length of their stays. ASB collects the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP address. We may also determine what technology is available through your browser in order to present you the most appropriate version of a web page (i.e. Flash or HTML).
(d) IP Addresses: When visitors request pages from our Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number of visits to different pages, photos viewed or videos watched on our Site.
(e) Cookies: Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a website when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the Site, the Site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve the Site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular, to personalize the Site and improve the Site experience. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our Site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the Site’s features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.
We do not store any PI in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any information we collect. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policy. Visitors to our Site should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.
4. ASB Use and Disclosure of Collected Information
