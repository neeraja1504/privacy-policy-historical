Our Commitment to Privacy - AskforTask
AskforTask Inc. (“ we ”/” us ”) is committed to protecting privacy. We make the website, www.askfortask.com (the “ Website ”) and the AskforTask mobile applications (the “ AskforTask App ”) available for download together with our services as further described in our Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users of the Service.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual (unless you give us your consent, for example in connection with testimonials or reviews on the Service) and we don’t sell customer lists.
Collection of Information : We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Service, to process payments, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes and for service improvement.

Two types of information may be collected through the Service: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. We also collect location data At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Service through registration processes; communications with you; information downloads; service purchases; user support; and surveys.
"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature which does not identify an individual. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Service is not considered Personal Information. Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Service.
