What Information We Collect/How We Use It
We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide our marketing partners if you joined AskDrSears.com though one of our partners) requests that you provide certain contact and profile information. That information includes but may not be limited to: name, address, email address. Additional information may include, but not be limited to, health and lifestyle information about you and your family such as marital status and household information (spouse, children, pets, etc.), ethnicity, education, income, occupation, purchasing habits, reading habits, insurance, height, weight, physical and mental health conditions and diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, medical devices, vitamins, health habits, participation in research surveys and clinical trials.
In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your AskDrSears.com membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).
We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened an AskDrSears.com e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members.

to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
to send you general and administrative information about your AskDrSears.com membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and
to provide your contact information to AskDrSears.com marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail.
