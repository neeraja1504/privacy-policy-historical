Privacy Policy - ASIA Travel Tips.com
Thank you for using ASIA Travel Tips.com. For many years we did not had a Privacy Policy publicly displayed on ASIA Travel Tips.com for the simple reason that most Privacy Policies have a clause that state that it may change at any time. It was for this reason, that we never publicly displayed our policy even though as a company, we have always had a very strict internal Privacy Policy which is followed to the letter. In addition to this, however often do the average user check a site's privacy policy? I know most of us here never do.
Further down you can read the official "more legal" Privacy Policy if you wish, however it really is very simple. Any information that we obtain from you be it, your email, name or other information is never sold or given to any third party (this excludes hotel reservations where your details are shared between us and the hotel where you are making the reservation). We never send out unsolicited email to any of our users at any time. If you feel that you have been receiving something from us which you should not, then please let us know and we will immediately look into the matter. We respect your privacy, in exactly the same way as we respect our own.
Our hotel reservations are made through an encrypted and secure SSL connection meaning that the information your provide when making a reservation is shared only with us and the hotel where you are making the reservation. Also, because many users startedasking for immediate confirmations to their hotel reservations we signed up with a third party that allows us to do just that. This added convenience however does mean that the privacy policy of the third party comes into effect once you pass from our site to theirs.
Now for the more legal version:
