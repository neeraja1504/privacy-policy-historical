Asia Society Website Privacy Statement
The Asia Society last amended this Privacy Statement ("Statement") on May 25, 2018.
This Statement describes how the Asia Society collects and uses information from our websites' visitors, including Asia Society members. This Statement applies to the websites we control and which are accessible via the following domains: asiasociety.org, asiasociety.net, asiasociety.com, asiastore.org, asiasource.org, askasia.org, asiasocietymuseum.org, asiafood.org, asiainnyc.org, asiasocietysocal.org and internationaled.org (collectively, "Our Site"). This Statement does not apply to any other web pages or websites.
By using Our Site, you consent to our collection and use of information about you in accordance with this Statement. We may change this Statement by occasionally posting an updated version of it on this page. If we decide that it is appropriate, we may also post a notice of the update on Our Site's home page at http://www.asiasociety.org/. By continuing to use Our Site after we have posted any changes, you agree to the terms of the updated Statement. This Statement is part of the Terms that govern your use of Our Site, so please read the entire Terms.
We collect two kinds of information from Our Site's visitors: anonymous information and personally identifiable information.
Updates Related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The General Data Protection Regulation takes effect as of May 25, 2018, across the European Union. It is designed to offer increased privacy protection, giving individuals stronger and more consistent rights to access and control their personal information. Given the cross-border nature of so many of our transactions today, Asia Society is currently reviewing our policies to ensure they are in compliance with the new regulation. We have put together a cross-organization team to assess our GDPR readiness, identify any gaps and create and implement any changes required to our policies.
Asia Society takes the protection of your personal information seriously. We already have a strong and protective privacy program in place. However in light of the new regulation, we are currently conducting an information audit to review all the ways we collect personal information, reviewing our consent mechanisms to be sure that you understand what you’re granting us and why and how we use it, and evaluating our agreements with the third parties who process some of your personal information to ensure they/we are GDPR compliant.
We will post an updated privacy policy on our website within the next few weeks. In the meantime if you have any questions, you can contact webmaster@asiasociety.org.
Anonymous Information
Our servers automatically log certain information that does not personally identify you ("Anonymous Information"). We use this Anonymous Information in aggregate form to help us manage and improve Our Site. The Anonymous Information we record includes, for example, the pages you visit on our Site, the amount of time you spend viewing those pages, the links and advertisements you click, the browser you use, the address of the web page that referred you to Our Site, and your Internet Protocol address, which tells us about your location and your connection to the Internet.
We do not link Anonymous Information with personally identifiable information. However, we reserve the right to do so, in our discretion, for safety or security reasons or to comply with the law.

Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal Data")
We also collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us through Our Site ("Personal Data"). For example, we collect Personal Data when you fill out a member registration form, sign up for a program or event, subscribe to an email newsletter, purchase something from our store, submit a request for information, complete a survey or make a donation or purchase. The types of Personal Data that we collect include:
Name
Postal address
Email address
Telephone number
Age
Sex
Racial or ethnic information
Educational background
Professional and employment-related information, including salary
Financial information, such as credit card numbers
Hobbies and special interests
Other memberships and affiliations you have
We use Personal Data for the purposes for which you provide it, and for other purposes unless you ask us not to do so, including:
To fulfill orders for merchandise in our store
To fulfill orders for membership, services or products
To manage memberships and other subscriptions to our services
To process registrations for events, courses and other activities
To facilitate participation in contests or surveys
To personalize services provided to Asia Society members and visitors to Our Site
To promote our other activities, services or products to you
To send communications to you on behalf of other organizations that we believe may be of interest (see more detail below under "Communications Sent to You")
We may also collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us about other people. We use this information only for the purpose for which you originally provide it. For example, if you submit another person's email address in order to have material from Our Site forwarded to them (also known as an "email-a-friend" feature), we do not keep the other person's email address. If you purchase and ship products to someone, we will use this information to fulfill your request but will not send marketing communications to your contacts.

Google Analytics
The Google Analytics features Asia Society has implemented is based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).
Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.
Asia Society will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless you have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.

Communications Sent to You
We distribute newsletters and other communications by email and regular postal mail. We send these communications to you only if you have signed up to receive them or if you have agreed to receive them as part of an Asia Society membership. We may also use your Personal Data to contact you individually if you initiate correspondence with us. For example, if you email us, we may respond using the contact information you provide.
From time to time, we may use your Personal Data to allow other organizations to send communications that may be of interest to you. We (or our agents) send these mailings on behalf of the other organization, which does not have access to your Personal Data at any time. We exclude our database of Asia Society members from these mailings.

Sharing Information with Third Parties
We do not share, transfer or release Personal Data to third parties besides the contractors who provide us with services necessary to our operations (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers help us with, for example, web hosting, order fulfillment, subscription management, conference registrations, survey administration, software development, database maintenance, website consulting and credit card processing. These Service Providers may have access to your Personal Data.
In addition, we may occasionally refer you to a Service Provider’s site for help in serving you. For example, we may link you to a Service Provider’s site to process a conference or program registration, to take an order for special Asia Society publications or to gather survey responses. When you follow a referral or a link away from Our Site, you leave Our Site.  This Statement applies only to Our Site, and not to our Service Providers’ sites. You should review their privacy statements to find out how they protect your privacy.
Finally, we reserve the right to disclose and use Personal Data for necessary purposes, including: to protect our proprietary rights; to protect the safety of customers, employees or property; to carry out a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets; or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

Firewalls
Software to detect viruses and other intrusions into Our Site and computers
Secure hosting environment for our web servers
Storage of Personal Data on password-protected computers
Restricting access to Personal Data to necessary Asia Society staff
Of course, no mechanism can guarantee that information storage or transmission over the Internet is perfectly safe. We make no warranty, guarantee or representation that Our Site is protected from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities or that your Personal Data is always secure. Accordingly, you provide us with your Personal Data at your own risk.
