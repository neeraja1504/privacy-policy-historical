We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988 with respect to collection, use and disclosure of personal information. See our Privacy Policy.
While every effort is made to secure information transmitted to this website over the internet, there is a possibility that this information could be accessed by a third party while in transit.
Information logged
When you browse our website, we use cookies to collect anonymous traffic data about how you interact with us. A cookie is small bits of code in the form of an electronic token that is passed to your browser and your browser passes it back to the server whenever a page is sent to you. This helps us measure how our services are used and what we can do to improve.
We won't try to identify you unless there's an investigation, for example if we issue a warrant or subpoena. Your personal information will be disclosed to third parties only if it's required or authorised by law.
Examples of data logged by our server when you visit this website includes:
what device you are using including the type of browser and operating system you are using
your top level domain name, for example, .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc. and how you came to our website, such as the address of the referring site such as the previous site that you visited
your server's IP address which is a number which is unique to the machine through which you are connected to the internet
the date and time of your visit
the address of the pages accessed and the documents downloaded.
Any information logged is stored securely, and archived for a period of at least 2 years and possibly up to 10 years.
Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager
In addition to web service logs, we use Google Analytics (including the Advertising Features) and Google Tag Manager, which are web analysis services provided by Google Inc. ('Google').
All the information we collect using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager is for internal purposes only. We cannot identify individuals based on the data we collect and we won't publish any of it on our website.
Reports obtained from Google Analytics are used to improve the efficiency and usability of this website. Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyse how users use this site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The Advertising Features is a function within Google Analytics to get more advanced information about our users, such as user demographics, user interests, and frequency of visits. For more information on how Google uses the data collected, visit Google's Privacy Policy and Google Analytics Terms of Service. To opt out and prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics, you can download Google's opt out add-on.
Google Tag Manager lets us combine codes on different areas of the website and collect data in ways that we can't do with Google Analytics. For more information on how Google uses the data collected, visit Google's Privacy Policy.
By using this website, you consent to Google processing data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
