INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DELIVERY OF ADVERTISEMENTS
In the course of delivering an advertisement to Codango visitors, Codango, or its advertising agency, does not collect any personally-identifiable information about the Web site user, such as the user's name, address, phone number or email address. Codango's advertising agency does, however, collect non-personally identifiable information, such as the server a user's computer is logged onto, the user's browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether the user responded to the advertisement delivered.
Codango's use of the non-personally identifiable information collected by Codango's advertising agency may include targeting advertisements and measuring advertisement effectiveness.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by those visitors. Codango uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection. Codango does not sell personal information to third parties. Codango may share personally identifiable information with other parts of our company, but this will never be used on an individual basis outside of the company. Codango maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of personally identifiable information in its possession. Codango may use such personally identifiable information in the aggregate (non-identifiable) form to make our Web site better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable information may also be used by or provided to others for marketing, advertising, or research purposes.
