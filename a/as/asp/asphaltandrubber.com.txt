We collect the following types of information from our Asphalt & Rubber users:

Asphalt & Rubber is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. Asphalt & Rubber may send out e-mails with Asphalt & Rubber-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Asphalt & Rubber, which inform you of actions (e.g. comments or recent news posts) that have been performed on the site.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use the majority of Asphalt & Rubber’s features hassle free.
Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
