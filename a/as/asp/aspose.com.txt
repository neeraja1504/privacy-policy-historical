You should be aware though, that if you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer such information, within Aspose or to Aspose's third party service providers, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, subject to the limitations of this Privacy Policy.
Aspose strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Aspose intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
When you visit Aspose.com, you may surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to analyze and improve our site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. "Cookies" cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, therefore allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will not be able to access such pages.)
While Aspose uses cookies to track your visit to Aspose.com, and our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Aspose with Personal Information.
Newsletters
From time to time, Aspose will provide information to their customers in the form of electronic newsletters. When you subscribe to the Aspose.com newsletter you will be added to our mailing list and will receive announcements and information about Aspose. The announcements and information will come from Aspose, not from third parties. It will be emailed directly to the email address that you provide when you subscribe. If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from us in the future, you can sign-in aspose.com and then unsubscribe at the following URL: http://www.aspose.com/community/user/editprofile.aspx

Security
Wherever your Personal Information may be held by Aspose or by a third party on Aspose's behalf, reasonable and appropriate precautions, such as encryption, firewalls and like technologies, are and will be implemented to protect such Personal Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.
Access/Accuracy
To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Aspose wishes to maintain it accurately and updated. Where we collect Personal Information from you, our goal is to provide a means of contacting Aspose should you need to access, update or correct that Information. If for any reason you desire to review such information, please contact us at privacy@aspose.com and we will make reasonable efforts to promptly provide you with such information.

Third-party Services
In the interest of providing better service to its customers, Aspose is represented in Australia and in some foreign countries by authorized distributors and resellers who provide marketing, sales, and support services to Aspose customers. When you submit personal information to Aspose, you understand and agree that Aspose may allow Aspose's authorized distributors and resellers access to your customer profile for the exclusive purpose of providing you with marketing, sales, and support services for Aspose products.
Your personal information will not be leased, sold, rented or otherwise made available to any other third party except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. Occasionally, Aspose allows access to database information to bonded mailing houses only for the purpose of allowing for the printing of mailing labels that are used for Aspose's own direct mail and promotional purposes. In those instances, the third party is strictly bound by these terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby agree that Aspose may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a material portion or essentially all of the assets or stock of Aspose or its affiliated entities.
