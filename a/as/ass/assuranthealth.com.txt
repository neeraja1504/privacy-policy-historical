Assurant Health and its affiliated companies are committed to protecting the personal information entrusted to us by consumers who visit our
website. The trust you place in us when you share personal information and/or the personal information of another person or entity is a responsibility
we take very seriously and is the cornerstone of how we conduct our business.
We use the brand name "Assurant Health" to associate our products and services and to connect us with the brand of our parent company, Assurant, Inc. This Policy is intended to inform our consumers of our practices with regard to consumers' personal information collected through this website. As used in this online Privacy Policy, the term "you and your" are defined to include all website visitors including, but not limited to, customers, brokers, third party administrators, and/or representatives of any of the above.
I. Categories of personal information we collect
The term "personal information" includes any individually identifiable information about you that we collect online, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, or social security number. We collect this information when you voluntarily disclose it to us in connection with a service offered on this website. Our website has security safeguards that are designed to protect any personal information that you decide to give us via this website. You may, however, choose not to provide this information and use an alternative form of communication such as telephone, fax, or regular mail. By using our website your consent to this online Privacy Policy is implied.
II. How we use and disclose personal information
If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as in an email to one of our online email boxes, by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website or by logging onto our website, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information you have requested. We also need information from you when you register for online access to your claims information. We use that information in order to process transactions that you request and to authenticate you as a registered user.
We do not sell or rent personal information about visitors to this site or consumers who use the site. We will use and disclose the information you give us only as required or permitted by law. This may include, for example, disclosures to third parties that perform business services on our behalf or in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or subpoena.

Personally-identifiable information is information that allows us to identify you. We collect, analyze, monitor online activities, and store any personal information that you voluntarily provide by sending us an email to one of our online email boxes, by filling out a form with personal information and submitting through our website or by logging onto our website.
This information helps us assist you with technical issues encountered when using our website, improve our website and make your visits more appealing. You may choose not to provide personal information to us by not sending us an email using our online email boxes, by not filling out a form with personal information and by not logging onto our website. Refer to Section XII for other ways to contact us.
IV. How we collect and use non-personal information
Non-personal information is generic data that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual. We look at such data on an individual and collective basis, to help us detect trends that might help us to improve our website.
We may gather generic data automatically from your web browser, such as: the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click path to, through, and from our website; mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as non-Personally Identifiable Information text you type in this website; and the date and time you access our website.
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information as long as it remains combined.
V. Email communication
To protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. Email is not a secure method of communication and is not encrypted. Accordingly, an email message potentially could be accessed and viewed by others without your knowledge and/or permission, while in transit to us.

If you prefer not to accept cookies, the help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, disabling cookies may result in certain parts of the website not operating correctly or prevent you from taking full advantage of some of the features of our website.
