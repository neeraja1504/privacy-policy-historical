FERPA compliance
Ashworth College’s policy regarding confidentiality is in keeping with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and affords student certain rights with respect to their education records. This includes the following:
The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day Ashworth College receives a request for access
The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. School officials are individuals or entities working for, or on the behalf of, the educational institution. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. As allowed within FERPA guidelines, Ashworth College may disclose education records without consent to officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
The right to file a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failure by Ashworth College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. At its discretion, Ashworth College may provide Directory Information in accordance with the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. Directory Information is defined as that information which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Students may withhold Directory Information by notifying the Registrar in writing. Please note that such withholding requests are binding for all information to all parties other than for those exceptions allowed under the Act.
For more information regarding Ashworth College FERPA compliance, please review the publically available institutional Catalog located here: Catalog.
Children’s privacy
Persons under the age of 18 years of age, and who have not been emancipated, cannot enroll into the College or High School without a parent or guardian’s signature. For a student who is under the age of 18 years, all rights regarding education records are given to the student’s parent or guardian.
