Analyses
In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.
Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
The tracking code embedded in this website uses display advertising. Remarketing as specified in Google Analytics for Display Ads is also used. You may find Ashampoo ads on third-party websites including Google. Ashampoo and third-party content providers, including Google, are using cookies. The combined approach of using primary cookies (e.g. cookies by Google Analytics) and cookies by third-party content providers (e.g. DoubleClick cookies) allows for interest-related ad development, optimization and display based on previous visits. You may disable Google Analytics for display ads at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb or customize the display of ads within the Google Display Network.
We are using these Google Adwords-related features to also reach our visitors on third-party websites or internet users with specific interest profiles based on their internet use. We do not collect any personal data with our cookies, remarketing lists or other anonymous ids.
By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above
Google Signals
In addition we use the web analysis service Google Signals. Via Google Signals, Google provides us with reports on cross-device number of users, as well as different groups of users, based on different device combinations. In order to do so Google uses the data of users who have activated the option “personalized advertising” in their Google account settings. Google Signals is only used with activated IP anonymization. As a result, your IP address will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other states that have ratified the Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the United States. Therefore, no single user can be identified. You can withdraw your consent to the collection of your data via Google Signals, at any time via disabling “personalised advertising” in your Google Account:

Software Installation and Activation
Activation, trial extension and unlocking of free software is achieved through an activation routine at program launch. This process requires an Ashampoo-registered email address and password. Alternatively, a license key can be used. Activation of a full version software requires an active Internet connection. During the process, a connection to a licensing server is established and a validity check performed. Invalid licenses / license keys or keys that have been used multiple times will result in the display of a licensing error in the program that will disappear once the program has been activated successfully. The validity of a product license will be automatically checked online at regular intervals.
The following information is transmitted when you activate a program with a license key:
The license key
A checksum
The product code
The version numbers
The language setting
You can check your current license keys at any time. Just visit MyAshampoo at https://www.ashampoo.com/myashampoo. Your personal MyAshampoo data is protected against unauthorized access, you can log in with your email address and a password you choose yourself. Your personal data will be stored anonymously unless you choose to enter your name, which is entirely optional. Our privacy policies for managing your data are very strict and we will never share your information with any third parties.
