The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for ASHP.org.

Cookies
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your online shopping cart. The shopping cart may not perform correctly if the cookies option is turned off in the browser settings. The ASHP website uses cookies to restrict access to some content. ASHP members who elect to browse the site with the cookies option turned off will not be able to access restricted content.
Log Files
Browser type, IP address, access time, and files accessed are collected in log files. ASHP uses this information to analyze traffic on the site and then discards the log files. Aggregate information generated from the log files is sometimes shared with advertisers.
Personally Identifiable Information
The site collects personally identifiable information at the following locations: Online ASHP Membership Form, Change of Address Form for ASHP Members, ASHP Virtual Mentoring Exchange, The ASHP Shopping Cart, Professional Information Form, and the CE Testing Center. The information collected includes name, title, home address, business address, practice demographics, email, and credit card number (when a purchase is made). ASHP uses customer contact information from the forms to send orders, email news services, newsletters, its journal (AJHP), Products Catalog, and event announcements. The non-financial information we collect is sometimes shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. Users may choose to decline receiving future mailings; please see the “Opting Out“ section below. Aggregated demographic information may also be compiled and shared, but does not identify the individual user.
Special Relationships
Part of the ASHP Superstore is a royalty arrangement with Doody Publishing. Doody Publishing collects personally identifiable information only for billing purposes and never shares personal information with third parties. Doody Publishing does share with ASHP aggregate sales information as part of the royalty arrangement. Please read Doody Publishing's privacy policy for additional information.
