Privacy Policy | ashrae.org
Approved by Board of Directors 2005-06-29
I. Privacy Policy
ASHRAE members and others have noted the importance of privacy and confidentiality in providing and accessing information directly to ASHRAE and in using the ASHRAE web site. ASHRAE has established policies relating to the gathering and sharing of information, as outlined herein.
It is ASHRAE’s policy to keep personal information collected by ASHRAE confidential, and to not sell, rent, loan, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties, except as described in this Privacy Policy, unless permission is obtained from the user or as required by a lawful court order or subpoena. Use of member contact information by volunteers conducting ASHRAE activities, under the safeguards outlined herein, is not considered third party use. Also, sharing of contact information, under the safeguards outlined herein, may be considered a requirement of volunteer involvement.
ASHRAE seeks to use commercially reasonable managerial and technical precautions to help protect the security and integrity of the personal information collected directly by ASHRAE or through the Internet. Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by ASHRAE, 'perfect security' does not exist at ASHRAE or on the Internet. ASHRAE cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit directly to ASHRAE or from its website, hence you transmit such information at your own risk.
II. No Collection of Information from Children
ASHRAE does not intend to collect personal information from children who identify themselves as being less than 18 years of age. Children should not submit any personal and/or private information directly to ASHRAE or on the ASHRAE web site, and should ask their parents to submit a request on their behalf if they want to receive information related to the web site.
III. Privacy Practices of Other Sites
This Security and Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information ASHRAE collects directly from our members, our customers or online through the web site, http://www.ashrae.org. Note: that the ASHRAE web site may include links to the sites of ASHRAE’s business partners, sponsors, advertisers, or others. ASHRAE is not responsible for the content or the security and privacy policies of these other sites, which may be different from ASHRAE’s security and privacy practices.
Also, this Security and Privacy Policy does not apply to sites of any ASHRAE chapter, region, student branch, technical committee or other group affiliated or associated with the Society.
IV. The Information We Collect
Browser information collected on the ASHRAE web site:
ASHRAE analyzes our site logs to continually improve the value of the content and services available on the site. In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information, like the number and frequency of visitors to ASHRAE and to particular portions of the site. Our site logs are not personally identifiable, and we do not attempt to link them with the individuals who actually browse the site.
As you click through the pages on the ASHRAE site, our server logs information about your session on the site. This includes such information as the site address from which you came, the browser you are using, the country from which you are accessing the Internet, the time and date of your visit, how long your session lasted, what pages you visited, and your Internet Provider (IP) address.
ASHRAE logs IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. (Your IP address indicates the location of your computer on the Internet.) We do not log IP addresses to track your session, nor do we link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information except when recording IP addresses when members or customers chose to purchase IP access to ASHRAE literature.
We use the information from our server logs to learn about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. This information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site. We may use this information for any of the following purposes:

Access is given to volunteer leaders of respective committees, chapters and regions for use in conducting ASHRAE business only in accordance with guidelines contained in a document entitled “Society Contact Data Availability” approved by ASHRAE’s Board of Directors.
