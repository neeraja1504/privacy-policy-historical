Privacy Policy | A Slob Comes Clean
ASlobComesClean.com uses google analytics to collect site statistics which are used to solicit advertising and for general family entertainment.  Mama has to know what to say when her kid asks how many people came to her blog today.
Google Analytics provide general information such as how people arrived at this site and how long they stayed.
It helps me see how many people came from a certain site, which percentage were new, and how many of them stuck around.  I use this to determine if it’s worth my time to post on various sites such as Facebook, Pinterest, etc.
Personally identifiable information is not available through these sources.  While they supposedly say the location of the visitor, they’re often wrong.  I know this because I can tell when the visitor is me, and the location is rarely the same, and is never my actual location.  Nothing to freak out about.
Emails – Email addresses are required to leave a comment.  This prevents (or supposedly prevents) comment spam, and also allows you to receive direct replies to your comment via email.  I do not collect or sell any email addresses you leave here.  You will only be signed up for my email newsletter if you . . . sign up for my email subscription.
Here are the same things, written in a much more thorough and legally way:
As the owner of this website (the “Site”),  Dana K White  (“we” or “us”) understand that your privacy is of critical importance.  This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect from you via the Site and how we use and disclose such information.
