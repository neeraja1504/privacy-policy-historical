Privacy Policy | A Small Orange Web Hosting
Privacy Policy
Privacy is extremely important at A Small Orange and we are committed to ensuring that we respect and protect our customers' privacy. The three basic tenets of our privacy policies here at A Small Orange are:
Collect only what we need. We will not ask you for information we do not need to serve you in some way. Our job is to be your web hosting company, not to be a data mining company.
Share only when we have to. We do not and will not share any of your personal information unless we have your permission or we are required to do so by law or similar process.
Ensure that we keep private information private. We will do what we can (within reason, of course) to ensure that any personal information you have given us will remains private.
The three tenets above are intentionally very simple. If you are interested in more details regarding our privacy policies, keep reading. If you have any questions, feel free to get get in touch with us.
