A SQUARED ARMORY 100% SECURE SHOPPING GUARANTEE
At A Squared Armory, we realize that shopping online can feel a bit risky. However, the truth of the matter is that advances in secure server technology have made shopping at A Squared Armory just as safe as using your credit card to shop around town or over the phone. Our goal is for you to feel as comfortable using your credit card at A Squared Armory as you do everywhere else that you shop. To that end, A Squared Armory has partnered with Verisign for all online credit card transactions.
Verisign, the leading provider of digital trust services, has been processing credit cards securely over the Internet since 1995 and currently provides secure payment services for more than 60,000 online merchants. Verisign's internet payment gateway supports the Internet's strongest security technologies, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with 128-bit encryption. These encryption technologies work with Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), and AOL (AOL 3.0 and above). All financial information submitted on A Squared Armory's site is encrypted and digitally signed as it travels over the Internet using Verisign's industrial-strength combination of DES encryption and RSA public key technology.
Verisign transactions are protected by the highest levels of security available and ensure complete and total privacy for A Squared Armory's online customers. Using your credit card affords you the added advantage of knowing that, in the event that there is a problem with your purchase, the credit card company will remove the purchase from your bill and A Squared Armory will not be paid. Furthermore, in the extremely unlikely event that shopping at A Squared Armory leads to an unauthorized use of your credit card, most financial institutions either cover all of the resultant charges or limit your liability to $50 (refer to the Fair Credit Billing Act or your credit card agreement for further details). Should the bank not cover this additional $50 liability, A Squared Armory will cover it, provided that the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted from an error on the part of A Squared Armory as a result of purchases made on A Squared Armory through the secure server, and through no fault of your own. In short, using your credit card at A Squared Armory is absolutely safe - we guarantee it.
NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN
A Squared Armory does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or sell to children under the age of 18.
