Privacy Policy | ACS
The American Constitution Society ("ACS") is sensitive to online privacy concerns. Among our organization's central goals is the protection of individual rights and liberties, including privacy.  The following is our privacy policy for information collected through our websites (www.acslaw.org and www.judicialnominations.org) and email communications systems.
ACS may, from time to time, need to revise its privacy policy as it continues to improve its websites and email communications systems to better serve its members and supporters.
Collection and use of personally identifiable information
The American Constitution Society will not sell or share the personal information you provide or we collect through our websites or our email communication systems outside our organization.  Through our websites and email communication systems, users are enabled to join or contribute to ACS, to RSVP for events, or otherwise provide personally identifiable information.  In this process, you may be requested to provide your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, biographical information such as your place of employment and educational background, information on your relationship and experience with the organization, or other personally identifiable information.  All of this information will be kept confidential, and ACS does not retain financial information used to process a transaction.
The American Constitution Society’s websites and email communication systems use “cookies” (small data files placed on your computer) to store such information that you choose to supply, and will not share this information with third parties.
Tracking our websites' traffic and email effectiveness
Like many organizations, the American Constitution Society uses Google Analytics as well as "cookies" to track statistics about our websites, such as page views, unique views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits and peak-volume traffic periods.  ACS uses this information to improve the value of its websites. ACS also tracks statistics through its email communication system in order to improve its email program; these statistics include open rates, click rates, single-page visits to our websites, multi-page visits to our websites, return visits to our websites, number of page views, and duration of visit to our websites.
Email lists
The American Constitution Society maintains email lists to inform interested parties about our various activities. ACS does not share or sell addresses on such lists with any third parties. ACS may share email information of attendees at co-sponsored events with organizations co-sponsoring any particular event.  You will be able to unsubscribe from email communications from ACS through "Unsubscribe" option at the bottom of each email communication from us.
