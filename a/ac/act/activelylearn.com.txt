Actively Learn - Privacy Policy
Actively Learn Inc. “Actively Learn“ developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, store, use, communicate and disclose your information.
INTRODUCTION
Actively Learn is committed to protecting the privacy of the students and teachers who use our products and services. We want you to know how we use your information, and how students, their parents, teachers, and administrators have control over that information.
We collect the bare minimum of personally identifiable information necessary (first name, last name, username, and class) for students to establish an account on Actively Learn and be identified by their teacher and associated with the work students do in our application.
Students’ and teachers’ personally identifiable information is stored securely on our servers and protected with numerous technological and procedural safeguards.
We do not sell or lease students’ or teachers’ personal information to third parties for advertising, marketing, or other purposes.
We are compliant with FERPA and COPPA.
By using Actively Learn, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree with this policy or have any questions about it, you can contact us anytime at privacy@activelylearn.com.

COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information ( PII ) is data that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, email address or credit card information. We may collect personal information from you for a variety of reasons such as processing your order for the purchase of a product or service, registering your product, enabling the use of certain features of a product, supporting a solution, downloading a software update, communication for marketing purposes from Actively Learn, creating an Actively Learn ID, or managing a job application. The PII we collect is different for teachers and staff, students under 18, and children under 13. For example, we collect first and last name, email, and school name and address for each teacher or staff member. Billing address and payment details are collected and passed to our payment processor but are not stored by Actively Learn. For students under 18, we collect first and last name and school name for each student, and the email address if school policy or technical infrastructure requires students to create accounts on Actively Learn using their email address (e.g., Google Classroom schools).
We may use PII for internal purposes such as data analysis and research to improve our products, services and content. We may also use PII to send you important notices regarding product purchases or changes to our terms and conditions or policies, and to occasionally contact teachers and staff to answer questions, resolve issues they or their students may encounter while using our product, and to inform them of new features on our platform. If you provide personal information of a third party, we will assume that you have the third party’s permission to provide such information. Student PII is used only to provide the Actively Learn service to the student and authenticate the student when logging in. It is not used for advertising of any kind nor any other non-educational purpose.
Here are examples of how we collect user information:
Account information:  When an educator or student creates an account on Actively Learn, we collect their name, email address, school, and, depending on the method of signup, a password for accessing their Actively Learn account. They also have the option of uploading a profile picture. Students cannot create an account by themselves; their teacher must first create a class in Actively Learn and invite students to join it.
Credit card and billing info: When teachers purchase content or upgrade to a premium plan, we collect credit card and billing information and pass it securely along to our payment processor, Stripe. We do not store credit card and billing information on our servers.
Communications: Actively Learn collects communications that teachers and administrators send us directly via e-mail and through our in-app support system.
Classroom content: We collect instructional content created by teachers on our platform when they build assignments including questions, notes, links, and media, student work including discussion and question answers, and teacher assessment of student work including grades and feedback.
Analytics and log data: When you use Actively Learn, we collect additional identifying information including your IP address as well as metadata about your browser version and operating system. We also collect analytics on platform and feature usage, including metrics such as reading time.
We use this information only to provide the Actively Learn service to you. For example, we use this information to:
Allow you to access your Actively Learn account and to create and teach lessons in Actively Learn.
Notify you about activity in your classes (if you’ve indicated in your account settings that you’d like notifications).
Provide you with customer support.
Research, understand, and analyze usage trends to improve Actively Learn and develop new features.
As described in this policy, Actively Learn uses administrative, technological and physical safeguards to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
PARENTAL CONSENT
Teachers and schools are required to get parental consent before setting up student  accounts, or asking students to set up their own account, for students who are not legally old enough to give their consent for these purposes. The age varies by country, and in the U.S. it is 13. There are several ways to get parental consent. For teachers in the United States, the most common method is to act as the parent’s agent and provide consent on their behalf, which an educator or institution may do as long as they use Actively Learn solely in an educational context as provided by the FTC. Learn More.
FERPA and COPPA COMPLIANCE
For U.S. users, Actively Learn’s data protection and privacy policies and practices comply with FERPA (Family Education Rights & Privacy Act), COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), and other applicable federal and state education privacy laws.
We only collect personal information from children in the United States who are under 13 if the child’s parent or legal guardian has provided us with the necessary consent, or if the child’s educational institution has contractually agreed to obtain parental consent for the child to use Actively Learn’s services and to disclose information to us for educational purposes. Parents and legal guardians of these users have the right to review or have deleted the child’s personal information and refuse to permit its further collection or use by emailing privacy@activelylearn.com.
If you have reason to believe that a child under 13 years old has provided Actively Learn with personal information, and that child’s parents or school have not provided Acitvely Learn with the adequate consent, please contact us at privacy@activelylearn.com.
For further information about FERPA and COPPA compliance, or to access, modify, or remove any personal data, please contact us at privacy@activelylearn.com. To the extent that a provision in this policy conflicts with a provision in FERPA, COPPA, or another state or federal education privacy law, Actively Learn will abide by the more restrictive provision.
