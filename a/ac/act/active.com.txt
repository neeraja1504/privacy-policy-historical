If, during the Services, we collect your personal information on behalf of a third party, such as one of our customers who is an event organizer (“ our Client”/”Client ”), this will be brought to your attention at the time you provide your personal information. This Policy does not cover our Clients’ use of your personal information outside of our Services.

Further, as a result of your interactions with our Services or use of the Sites, you may purchase products or services offered by third parties (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings, or cruises) or you may elect to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site.

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN, AND WHY WE USE IT ABOUT YOU
ACTIVE is a leading provider of Activity and Participant Management™ solutions. Our flagship technology platform, ACTIVEWorks®, transforms the way organizers manage their activities and events by automating online registrations and streamlining other critical management functions, while also driving consumer participation to their events. Our Sites include online communities for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate.
The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites, use our Services and Applications, and register for and/or set up registration for you or your organization’s own customers for events, contests, camps, licenses, classes, tickets, facility/equipment use, transactions, sales, memberships, reservations, donations, and/or activities (collectively, “ Events ”).
We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from ACTIVE.
Individuals (and agents of individuals) may provide us information directly or indirectly by registering for an Event or by otherwise using our Services (these individuals are referred to as “Consumers”). For example, you may enter your information in order to register for an Event, or someone who has organized a team may enter your information on your behalf to register your entire team.
In addition, individuals or organizations (i.e. our Clients) can use our Services to set up Events for Consumers. Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about individuals who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.
We collect or receive personal information from you via our Sites, Applications and/or Services. For example, we receive personal information from you directly when you create an online account or register for an Event. We also collect personal information about you, for example, by using cookies to understand how you use our Sites.
We collect personal information from third parties whom you have authorised to provide your personal information to us (for example, this may be via one of our Clients, who provides your personal information to us). We combine this information with the information we collect directly from you or about you for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. More details on how we share your information with others is below in the HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN ACTIVE AND WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, REGULATORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES section. We also collect personal information from individuals who may refer you as a friend to our loyalty programs or products or services. We ask these individuals to confirm that you are happy to hear from us.
We will only collect, use, and share your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. The chart below summarizes when we collect personal information, the types of personal information we collect, how we use the personal information, and the legal basis for our use of such personal information.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN ACTIVE AND WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, REGULATORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES
We share your personal information in the manner and for the purposes described below:
• With other ACTIVE entities where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our Services or to manage our business. We may also share your personal information with other ACTIVE entities to improve the services we offer or help us to create new ones and to personalize the Services and offers you receive and or marketing, profiling and analytics as set out further in  EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING section below; and for the purposes set out in this Policy.
• With third parties who help manage our business and deliver services, for example, IT service providers who help manage our IT and back office systems or administer our Sites and Applications. These third parties have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and have agreed to use any personal information we share with them, or which they collect on our behalf, solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us.
• If you are using our Services to register for an Event or to purchase a third party product or service (for example, one of our Clients who is an Event organizer), ACTIVE shares the personal information that you provide with the applicable third party in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from such third party. Each such party operates independently from ACTIVE and, as we explained earlier, their collection of your personal information is not subject to this Policy but is subject to their own privacy notice. Please refer to that party’s privacy policy if you have any questions.
We may disclose information to third parties (with consent if required by law) such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. For further details, refer to EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING section below.
• With government organizations and agencies, law enforcement and regulators, to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies; in response to legal process.
• Banks and payment providers to authorize and complete card payments.
• We may share in aggregate, statistical form, non-personal information regarding the visitors to our Sites, traffic patterns, and website usage with our partners, affiliates or advertisers.
• If, in future, we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may disclose/transfer the information we have collected from you to the acquiring company.
TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY
International data transfer
We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence.
We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:
• we ensure transfers within ACTIVE will be covered by an agreement entered into by ACTIVE entities (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each such entity to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within ACTIVE;
•where we transfer your personal information outside ACTIVE or to third parties who help provide our Services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information; or
• where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information are disclosed.
You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.
EU Transfer Mechanism
ACTIVE participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. ACTIVE is committed to subjecting all personal information received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit  www.privacyshield.gov.
ACTIVE is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. ACTIVE complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, ACTIVE is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, ACTIVE may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Security
We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction, or loss, or unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned, including:
• (where appropriate) password protection, encryption, and use of secure communication transmission software (known as "secure socket layering" or "SSL") to protect our Sites;
• placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and service providers;
• destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; and
• following strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it. Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal information, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us and any such transmission is at your own risk.
As the security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password. You should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Storing your personal information
We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Policy. Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner. In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements.
In specific circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.
EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING

We also work with carefully selected third parties, such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. At all times, in accordance with your marketing preferences, these third parties may contact you by email, SMS/text, social media or through other communications channels to tell you about products and services that they believe would be of interest to you.
