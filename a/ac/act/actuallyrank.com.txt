LinkitPro.com uses audience re-targeting technology to reach out to previous visitors, via traditional, non-invasive advertising, as they use other popular websites. This occurs when users load our website, and our re-targeting technology loads a tracking cookie onto the users browser.
To opt-out and unsubscribe from our re-targeting campaigns, all you have to do is clear any cookies associated with LinkitPro.com, or our 3rd party advertising services, which may include ClickCertain, Adroll, and ReMarketingStats. For easy instructions on how to remove cookie files, please see this 3rd party tutorial.
The only additional information collected involuntarily from all visitors is basic geographic, referral, on-site navigation patterns and IP information for the purpose of tracking our website traffic statistics. We use this data in order to improve our website & user experience, as well as measuring the effectiveness of our advertising & marketing efforts.
Data is not evaluated on a "user by user" basis, but rather in the aggregate on a mass scale. We look at the overall patterns based on the statistical information collected from thousands of visitors.
The data is collected (and stored) by our preferred & reputable traffic analysis service. The data is stored securely and is not publicly available. Only LinkitPro.com (ownership & staff) can access this statistical data, without exception.
This data is collected through the use of a simple javascript script on each page of LinkitPro.com, and does not interfere with or affect the user's internet browsing program whatsoever.
LinkitPro.com does NOT use spyware, viruses, trojans or otherwise any invasive, objectional methods to increase incoming traffic, or otherwise for any other purpose.
