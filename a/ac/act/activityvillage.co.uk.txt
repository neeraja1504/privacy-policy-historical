To provide our services, we may collect your personal information in various ways. We explain the ways below and provide, in square brackets, the lawful bases for each as obliged by the EU GDPR.

Log files: When you browse our website, our services automatically receive and store information from your browser such as your IP address and the pages you visit. This information is stored in log files for up to 2 days. We may use this information to defend our servers against abuse, troubleshoot technical problems and understand how our platform is used. [Legal obligation GDPR Article 6(1)(c)] [Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]

3. Purchasing a Membership:
When you become a paid Member, our shopping card provider stores necessary information such as your name, email address, country (self-certified) and IP Address. We do not store your credit card or bank details ourselves as we use payment processors for security, but we are legally required to keep a record of these transactions for at least 6 years after the end of the financial year that you joined up in and, for EU citizens, for 10 years (to comply with EU Digital VAT policy). You can find more details about our shopping card provider and payment processors below. [Contract GDPR Article 6(1)(b), [Legal Obligation GDPR Article 6(1)(c)]
4. Subscribing to the newsletter:
When you sign up for our newsletter you give us your email address through one of our forms, and then confirm your request by clicking a link in a confirmation email. We use a newsletter service (details below) which stores your email address and IP address as well as information such as whether you open a newsletter or click on a link, which helps us to provide a better newsletter service. [Consent GDPR Article 6(1)(a)] [Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]
