4.2 Despite clause 4.1 , any act done or practice engaged in by ACU directly related to:
a current or former employment relationship between ACU and an individual, and
a current or historical employee record held by ACU relating to an individual
are exempt from this Policy in accordance with the Act and the APPs.

5.1  Personal information collected and held by ACU
ACU collects personal information for the purposes of ACU’s functions and activities. It collects personal information about staff, students and other individuals who have dealings with ACU for administrative need, to conduct its business, for legislative compliance or for research purposes.
The information may include residence and contact details, date of birth, details of next of kin, identifying information, including photographs, records of injuries, criminal checks, student enrolment information and academic performance, qualifications, financial information, information concerning individuals who apply to the University for appointment or admission, and information collected from or concerning human research subjects.
Some of the personal information that ACU collects and holds is sensitive information. ACU only collects sensitive information where it is necessary for the purpose for which it is being collected and with the individual’s consent unless the collection is required or authorised by law.
5.2  How ACU collects and holds personal information
ACU collects and holds information from a number of sources. Where reasonably possible, ACU will only collect information from the individual to whom it relates. Frequently this will be collected through official University administrative processes but it may also be collected from email, letters or other forms of communication.
ACU also holds personal information about individuals that it generates in the course of its operational activities, such as recruitment information, student placement information, research grant applications, academic feedback and examination results and library loan records.
Personal information is held in both paper and electronic form, including databases.
When an individual accesses the ACU website, log files (“cookies”) are created by the web server that contain certain information including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the visitor, the previous site visited, the time and date of access and pages visited and downloaded. Cookies allow a website, such as the ACU website, to temporarily store information on an individual’s machine for later use. ACU’s website uses cookies to identify unique visitors to the site.
In order to improve ACU’s services and assist the user, ACU may store information about users of its website to create a digital profile and provide them with information specific to them.
ACU also uses Web Analytics to obtain statistics about how its website is accessed. Web Analytics relies upon cookies to gather information for the purpose of providing statistical reports to ACU. The information generated by the cookie about an individual’s use of the ACU website is transmitted to and stored by Web Analytic service providers on servers located within and outside Australia, but it does not include any personally identifying information.
Individual users generally have the option of accepting or rejecting cookies by adjusting the settings in their web browsers. However, rejecting cookies may impact upon the functionality of the ACU website.
The ACU website may contain links to other websites. ACU cannot control the privacy controls of third party websites. Third party sites are not subject to ACU’s Privacy Policy or Procedures.
5.3  Notification of collection of personal information
When ACU collects personal information it will advise the individual why it is collecting that information and how it uses it, whether the collection of the information is required or authorised by law and the consequences for the individual if the personal information is not collected. It will also provide information about ACU’s Privacy Policy and about the right of individuals to access and correct personal information. If ACU collects personal information in circumstances where the individual may not be aware of the collection it will seek to advise the individual of the collection.
5.4  The purposes for which ACU collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information
ACU collects and uses personal information for a variety of different purposes relating to its functions and activities including:

maintaining contact with its alumni and with other stakeholders in the community
community engagement

conducting its business and improving the way in which it conducts its business
purposes directly related to the above.
5.5  Use or disclosure for secondary purposes
ACU does not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was collected ( the primary purpose ) unless:
5.5.1 the individual has consented to a secondary use or disclosure, or
5.5.2 the secondary use or disclosure is related to the primary purpose (in the case of personal information that is not sensitive information) or is directly related to the primary purpose (in the case of sensitive information), or
5.5.3 it is otherwise required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order,or
5.5.4 a permitted general situation exists (as described in clause 9 of this policy), or

5.6  Security
ACU applies both physical and information and communications technology (ICT) security systems to protect personal information.
In relation to electronic records, personal information is collected via ACU’s systems including web-based systems. ACU has put in place measures to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of electronic information. Where necessary, ACU also uses encryption technology to protect certain information and transactions.
5.7  Remaining anonymous or using a pseudonym
ACU understands that anonymity is an important aspect of privacy and that in some circumstances some people may prefer to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. People have the right to remain anonymous or to use a pseudonym when dealing with ACU. However for a significant proportion of its activities (e.g. matters relating to enrolment, teaching and assessment of individual students) it is impracticable for ACU to deal with individuals who have not identified themselves or who have used a pseudonym.
5.8  Unsolicited personal information
When ACU receives unsolicited personal information it will assess whether it is personal information that it could legally collect. If it is, it will treat it according to the APPs. If it is not, it will, if lawful to do so, destroy or de-identify it as soon as practicable.
5.9  Direct marketing
ACU will only use personal information for direct marketing with the individual’s consent or when authorised by law.

5.11  How an individual may access personal information about the individual that is held by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to access personal information that ACU holds about them. Access to personal information is governed by the Access to and Correction of Personal Information Procedure.
5.12  How an individual may seek the correction of personal information about the individual that is held by ACU
Subject to clause 4.2, anyone has a right under the Act to request corrections to any personal information that ACU holds about them if they think that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. Correction of personal information is governed by the Access Procedure.

ACU will manage the process of dealing with an actual or suspected breach in accordance with the Data Breach Procedure and Response Plan.
5.16  Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients by ACU
ACU may disclose personal information to overseas recipients. For instance, ACU my disclose personal information to an overseas university which requires proof of the academic standing of an individual before it permits the individual to enrol or to facilitate staff or student exchange. ACU will only do this at the request of, or with the specific approval of, the individual whose personal information it is.
ACU will disclose personal information in these circumstances to an overseas recipient in any country.
ACU may also disclose personal information to overseas recipients who are service providers for research or purposes, including data storage. Australian law may not apply to those recipients. ACU will ensure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place. Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients may also be required or authorised by law.

provide services
for purposes of research to improve its operations and services
facilitate national surveys carried out in relation to the higher education sector

Where ACU discloses personal information to third parties it will require restrictions on the collection and use of personal information equivalent to those required of ACU by the Privacy Act 1988.
