Privacy Policy
This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web Site. If you have questions regarding this statement, contact AccuQuilt Customer Service at +1(402) 934-1110.
AccuQuilt's Privacy Policy
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about AccuQuilt users, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
Information that AccuQuilt Gathers
AccuQuilt gathers two types of information about users:
Personal data , provided through voluntary registration
Aggregated data , which tracks users as a whole
Personal data may be requested when you sign up for AccuQuilt's personalized services or register for contests, sweepstakes or other promotional programs offered on our service. We ask for this in order to provide you with the best Web experience possible. This information might include member name, password, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information. Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties other than AccuQuilt and its parent companies in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission.
Aggregated data , which tracks AccuQuilt user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis, is gathered through several methods.This tracking data follows AccuQuilt traffic in general, and is not used to identify you personally. Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. AccuQuilt does not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We may disclose such aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners.
How AccuQuilt Uses Information
AccuQuilt uses any personal information that's voluntarily given by you in order to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
AccuQuilt will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to parties other than AccuQuilt and its parent companies without your consent. There are exceptions:
When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to protect our rights.
Contests and Sweepstakes
AccuQuilt occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. The full rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted during the event, including how information gathered will be used.
