membership or student membership with ACCA and comply with its regulatory obligations.
Details may include name, contact details, membership ID numbers, nationality, date of birth,
dates of affiliation, membership or fellowship, and details of payments, queries and complaints.
It is also voluntary for members, affiliates and students to provide ACCA with details of ethnic
origin, in order for ACCA to review equality or opportunity of treatment.

purposes. Recordings may be used to monitor the quality of the assistance given and to verify
the matters discussed.

materials, surveys, questionnaires, invitations regarding ACCA based consultations, details of
ACCA courses and events or to notify you of any updates and changes to ACCA’s products and
services.
ACCA may also carry out mailings on behalf of third parties (without disclosing your details to
such third parties), subject to obtaining your consent. Consent may be requested on your
ACCA registration form or separately by ACCA.

2.4 Training and employment
Training and examinations: Details of your training, attendance, tuition providers, examination
and course results will be used to administer courses and exams and to monitor the pass rates
and performance of tuition providers as well as ACCA students.            Please note that some
examinations may be taken electronically.
ACCA Exchange: This is a service offered to large employers and tuition providers. It enables
them to upload details of the ACCA students whom they employ and/or are training, and monitor
examination status and results. ACCA requires such employers and tuition providers to obtain
your consent before including your details on this service.
ACCA Experience: This is a facility enabling students to upload CVs and other details about
themselves. Potential employers may view the uploaded information other than the students'
names, and may notify ACCA of any student whom they wish to contact. ACCA will ask your
permission before sending details to a potential employer using this tool.
CPD courses: ACCA offers CPD training courses for both members and non-members and will
need to hold contact details and attendance records in order to administer such courses.
2.5 Professional Conduct
ACCA holds records of enquiries, investigations and complaints relating to members and
registered students (or prospective and former students). Such matters may be sensitive in
nature and ACCA restricts internal access to information to those teams responsible for
investigating and resolving the relevant matters. However, please be aware that disciplinary
hearings and outcomes may be made public.
2.6 Publications
ACCA will use your name, mailing and/or email address and payment details in order to
manage subscriptions to ACCA's publications, including student accountant, finance matters,

exams. ACCA requires such service providers to use your personal data only for the purpose of
the relevant service.

parties. Both ACCA and the joint scheme partner will need to share information with each other
in order to operate the scheme.

shared with employers and tuition providers who receive this service, subject to obtaining your
consent – see paragraph 2.4 above.
5.4 Tuition provider results service: Some tuition providers subscribe to an ACCA "results service"
under which they may access examination results of the students they have trained in order to
monitor their pass rate performance. Your tuition provider is required to inform you separately if
they use your data in this way.
5.5 CPD accredited employers: ACCA may liaise with employers who are accredited for CPD
purposes to verify your employment with them and/or to validate their accreditation as a CPD
provider.

approved employer scheme, ACCA may liaise with your employer and provide relevant details
in order to give you the opportunity to receive additional member benefits (eg training courses).

register relating to accountancy accreditations. ACCA may also, at its option, include details of

Times in the UK.
