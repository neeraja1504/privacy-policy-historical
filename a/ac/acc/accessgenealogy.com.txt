Privacy Policy | Access Genealogy
At AccessGenealogy, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us (See this article to learn more about Privacy Policies.). This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by AccessGenealogy and how it is used.
Log Files
Like many other Web sites, AccessGenealogy makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. In reality I’ve only used the log files to identify attempted hacking of the website. So if you’re not trying to hack us, we’re not using the log files to track you.

Facebook Login
We enable users to login using their existing (or creating a new) account with Facebook. Any information that OneAll has access to is disclosed during the signup process. We ourselves locally store the name, url, and email address assigned to your Facebook account (or a Facebook email address if you don’t allow Facebook to disclose yours) and a copy of your profile image. If you comment on our website, your profile image will be displayed next to your comment, and your name linked to your Facebook profile. This enables other users to contact you directly on Facebook if they wish. We never disclose your email address. If you like or unlike a page of ours, or share it, we record the fact that somebody liked and/or shared our content, but we do not know who.
Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a piece of software that grabs data about our visitors. It’s something like an advanced server log, but on steroids. It’s the reason I don’t need to use our internal log files.
What does Google Analytics record?
How did you come to AccessGenealogy?
How long did you stay for?
What kind of browser are you using?
Are you using a mobile device?
And quite a bit more.
What do I do with your data?
The tracking information allows me to better understand the kind of people who come to my site and what content they’re reading. This provides me better information about what to include on the website, as well as design decisions.
All of my activity falls within the bounds of the Google Analytics Terms of Service.
Want to opt out of tracking?
You can also opt out of Google’s advertising tracking cookie or use a browser plugin to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software.
