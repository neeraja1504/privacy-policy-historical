These Service Providers receive the information reasonably necessary for them to perform services for Academy of Art University. Unless otherwise required by law, Academy of Art University does not disclose any Personal Information to third-parties; however, the University reserves the right to make exceptions, such as when it is believed that an emergency, illegal activity or some other reasonable basis exists for notifying or providing such information to the appropriate authorities.

Deceased Student Record Handling & Awarding of Posthumous Degrees
Release of Deceased Student Records
Education records are no longer protected under FERPA after a student’s death; consequently, the stewardship of records pertaining to a deceased individual is not a FERPA issue but a matter of institutional policy. During the first year after the death of the individual is recorded, Academy of Art University will release the educational records to family members and agencies contributing to the tuition payments of the student. Following the initial year, records will be provided to any individual upon request.
Awarding of Posthumous Degrees
The family or other interested parties of the deceased student may initiate a request for a posthumous degree through the Office of the Registrar’s Completion Committee. The committee will review the request and may recommend to the President the award of a posthumous degree, delivered to the family of the deceased. Posthumous degrees may be awarded when the student had satisfactorily completed at least two-thirds (2/3) of all coursework towards a degree and was actively enrolled at the time of death. Under special circumstances, the President or designee may grant the awarding of a posthumous degree or certificate for a student who has completed less than two-thirds (2/3) of the degree coursework. Petitions for a posthumous degree may be initiated at any time – there is no limit to how much time has transpired between the student’s passing and the request.
Effective Date: 3/7/2011
