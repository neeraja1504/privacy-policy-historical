We share the contact information you provide with the provider of the specific event or product in order to complete your registration or order. And we may use it, at your option, to notify you of improvements to our site, upcoming events, or product specials. We use your financial information to bill your credit card for your registration or order. At your option, we may store it on our secure server, to save you time on future registrations and orders. We also offer you the option of registering or ordering by telephone (by calling 800-735-8275 within the U.S. or 925-735-8275 from outside the U.S.).
