In the event you affirmatively act to register with one of the Sites or request additional information via the Sites, you agree to the following terms regarding your contact and personal information in addition to the general terms of this privacy policy tied to use of the Sites. The Sites' contact and/or registration forms request that users provide contact and other personal information (such as their name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, education level, educational interests, age, income and marital status). We use this contact and personal information to send the user additional information about our schools and partners. A user's contact and personal information may also be used by us to contact the user directly. We reserve the right to compile and sell the user's contact and personal information to a third party, including the information identified above or other information the user provides to the Sites during the use of the Sites.

TRACKING AND SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We share the personal information you provide on the online contact and/or registration forms with a third party vendor to process such information to filter out phony user submissions. The third party vendor stores this information but does not share it with other third parties.
In addition, personal information submitted to Sites related to our universities may be shared with other third-party vendors engaged by us to assist with the development, management, and/or operation of these Sites. These vendors do not share user information with any other company.
Information you provide through the online contact and/or registration forms for a particular school may be shared with other CEC-affiliated schools.
While your browser may also allow you to implement a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature through your browser’s settings, our Sites are not configured to honor DNT signals at this time
From time to time, our Sites may link to other websites and we may work with marketing or advertising partners, in which these third parties may collect information about you and/or your computer network over time and across different websites to provide targeted or personalized advertising (also referred to sometimes as online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising). For a current listing of our partners, please email privacymatters@careered.com. The practices of these third party companies may be different from ours, and are not governed by this privacy policy. We encourage our users to visit the websites of these companies and/or contact them directly for information about their privacy policies and practices.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy describes the types of information we currently collect, and the ways we use and protect that information. From time to time, we may collect different types of information and use that information in different ways - for example, when we add features or services to www.sanfordbrown.edu. In these cases, we may edit this policy to explain the new practices. Because protecting your privacy is very important to us, we do not expect major changes in policy.
