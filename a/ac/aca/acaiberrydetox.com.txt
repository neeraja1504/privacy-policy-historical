The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Acai Berry Detox
This policy applies to Acai Berry Detox's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Acai Berry Detox on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Acai Berry Detox's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Acai Berry Detox is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
Acai Berry Detox collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Acai Berry Detox survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Acai Berry Detox or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Acai Berry Detox , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Acai Berry Detox may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Acai Berry Detox or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Acai Berry Detox or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Acai Berry Detox.
1.2 Third Party List Information.
Acai Berry Detox collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Acai Berry Detox subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Acai Berry Detox seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Acai Berry Detox and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when Acai Berry Detox obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Acai Berry Detox or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Acai Berry Detox's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Acai Berry Detox service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
Acai Berry Detox currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Acai Berry Detox may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Acai Berry Detox to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Acai Berry Detox's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Acai Berry Detox to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Acai Berry Detox might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Acai Berry Detox's database, visits the fishing website, Acai Berry Detox receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Acai Berry Detox would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Acai Berry Detox may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Acai Berry Detox also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Acai Berry Detox's database.
(c) New Technology.
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Acai Berry Detox's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Acai Berry Detox strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
1.5 Outside Information.
Acai Berry Detox may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of Acai Berry Detox including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
1.6 Individual Information.
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Acai Berry Detox gathers or receives about individuals.
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.
Acai Berry Detox will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Acai Berry Detox obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Acai Berry Detox has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Acai Berry Detox has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
1.8 Credit Card Information.
Acai Berry Detox may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Acai Berry Detox. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Acai Berry Detox, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Acai Berry Detox will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

Acai Berry Detox stores the Individual Information in a database on Acai Berry Detox computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Acai Berry Detox's control.
