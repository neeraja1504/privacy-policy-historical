Website Visitors
Like most websites, AzerDict collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, including: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); and (d) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, which may include the word look-ups you previously submitted. AzerDict's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how AzerDict's visitors use its website. From time to time, AzerDict may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. AzerDict does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

AzerDict discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AzerDict's behalf or to provide services and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. AzerDict will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, AzerDict discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when AzerDict believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AzerDict, third parties or the public at large.
