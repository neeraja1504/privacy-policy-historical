Information You Provide
Information collected from an application submitted online will be treated in the same manner as the information collected from an application submitted on a hard copy to Arizona State Parks and Trails. The information you disclose to us will generally become a matter of public record pursuant to A. R. S. §§ 39-121, et seq., which means that the agency may be required to divulge certain information in response to a public records request or in response to a warrant, subpoena, or other court order.
Arizona State Parks and Trails may require that you enter personal information (e.g., your name, home address, and credit card number) when requesting certain goods or services described on our website. Those services may also reference common infrastructure utilities that are provided by Arizona @ Your Service. These utilities provide the agency with a means to obtain specific information or to facilitate a specific functional requirement of the online transaction being requested.
As an example, Arizona @ Your Service maintains a central credit card payment interface that Arizona State Parks uses as part of our online gift shop service. This utility will accept only the pertinent credit card authorization data necessary to validate and fulfill the purchase. The cardholder's name, credit card number, and expiration date are obtained by the utility and used only to complete the credit card payment portion of the online transaction. The data is used only for the fulfillment of the payment and is not retained by Arizona @ Your Service.
Not all online applications use the services of Arizona @ Your Service, nor are they required to. Please be assured that your personal information will be held in strictest confidence while Arizona State Parks processes your online transaction and will not be shared, sold, or otherwise disseminated to any outside person or entity, except as required or authorized by law.

The state will take prudent steps to ensure that third-party organizations are obligated to secure and protect personal information on the State’s behalf.
