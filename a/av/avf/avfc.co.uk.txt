As we review our databases on a quarterly basis, personal data may be retained for slightly longer than the periods specified above, until the next quarterly review.
Where you have opted in to receive marketing, we retain details of your consent and shall continue to market to you in accordance with your preferences for a period of 2 years from your last interaction with the Club or until you opt out, whichever is earlier.
For the purposes of retaining personal data, we currently regard the following as interactions with the Club: attending a Club match; logging into your online account; purchasing a product from the Club’s Online Store; opening an email from the Club. We may update this from time to time, depending on the data available to the Club to capture interactions.
We keep information which may relate to accidents or injuries for a period of 3 years from the date of the last entry in the log in which it is recorded (or, where the accident involves a child/ young adult, until that person reaches the age of 21, if longer). We do this in case there are any queries and to respond to any claims in relation to that incident. If we are aware that claim or legal action is or ongoing in relation to an accident or injury, we will keep relevant information until that claim or legal action has concluded.
We keep other information which may relate to a claim or legal action for a period of 7 years (or longer, if a claim or legal action is in progress). We do this in case there are any queries and to respond to claims in relation to that incident.
We keep CCTV footage for a period of 28 days following the recording (or longer if required in connection with an ongoing issue or if required by law).
10. Your legal rights  ** ** (Back to Top)**
It is important that the personal data the Club holds about you is accurate and current. Please keep the Club informed if your personal data changes.
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data the Club holds about you and to check that it is lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that the Club holds about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information the Club holds about you corrected.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask the Club to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for it continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask the Club to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal data where the Club is relying on a legitimate interest (see section 3 for those circumstances) (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. We may be able to continue processing even if you object (if we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if in connection with legal claims).
Object to processing where the Club is processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask the Club to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want the Club to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent or of any processing that is lawfully carried out for another purpose (for example, to comply with a contract or a legitimate interest). If you withdraw consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that the Club transfers a copy of your personal data to another party, please contact the Club in writing using the contact details given in section 2. Please ensure you give us details of your identity and contact details so we can identify you and the personal data in question and contact you in relation to your query.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, the Club may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, the Club may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
The Club may need to request specific information from you to help it confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
11. Children under the age of 16  ** ** (Back to Top)**
We expect parents and guardians to supervise their child when they access the Club’s websites, mobile applications and other services provided by the Club's websites,
If you are under the age of 16, you must ask your parent / guardian for consent before you access the Club’s services or provide personal data or other information to the Club.
12. Data Protection Officer  ** ** (Back to Top)**
The Club’s designated Data Protection Officer (dpo@avfc.co.uk) will oversee compliance with this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how the Club handles your personal data, please contact the Club using the details given in section 2.
