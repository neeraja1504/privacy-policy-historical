How we get the information and why we have it
All of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for the purposes of operating your forum membership.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful basis we rely on for processing this information is your consent. You are able to remove your consent at any time by asking for your membership to be deleted. You can do this by contacting us here.
What we do with the information we have
We use the information that you have given us in order to operate your forum membership. We will not share this information with anyone.
Disclosure of personal information
AVForums does not disclose your personally identifying information to any third parties for any purpose without your prior consent unless required by law to do so.
It's also important to be aware that when you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on the forum, that information is publicly available and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage the offering of any personally identifying information within the forum itself.
How we store your information
Your information is securely stored digitally on the AVForums database servers hosted by Nimbus Hosting in the UK.
Data retention policy
Your personal information is stored in your AVForums membership account. We keep your AVForums account until it is deleted. Sometimes we delete inactive accounts. We will also delete your account if you request it to be deleted by contacting us here.
What happens when your AVForums account is deleted?
If we delete your account, we will dispose of your information using the delete process in the Xenforo forum software we use. This process removes your user record and all the associated information such as IP logs and private conversations. Your information will be removed from all the database backups once 30 days have passed from the process being initiated. In addition, your user name will be changed to 'Deleted User'. This process is non reversible.

Under data protection law, you have rights including:
Your right of access - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.
Your right to rectification - You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.

Your right to data portability - You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.
