Our our web and online presence we also offer the possibility of registering for our newsletter; advertising tools and social media plug-ins are used as well. Specifically:
1. Newsletter Registration and Competitions
If you would like to take advantage of the newsletter or take part in competitions, we need you to confirm your valid email address. In order to check whether you are the owner of the given email address, or that the address's owner consents to receiving the newsletter or taking part in competitions, after the first registration step we will send an automated email to the given email address ("double opt-in"). Only after confirmation of the newsletter registration or participation in the competition via a confirmation link in the email will we include the given email address in our mailing list. We do not collect any data other than the email address and the information that the registration has been confirmed.
Your data are processed exclusively for the purpose of mailing the newsletter you requested. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6(1b) of the GDPR. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time; in addition, the remarks on the right of revocation in (III.4) apply.
If you win as part of a competition, we will contact you at the email address provided to determine the mailing address for sending the prize.
2. Use of Personalized Data for Promotional Pitches and Marketing Messages / Customer Surveys
Your personalized data are used for the purpose of advertising and/or marketing and for the purpose of performing customer satisfaction surveys only when corresponding permission has been granted, or when there is another legal basis that permits advertising or marketing messages even without express consent.
The legal foundation for advertising and/or marketing measures on the basis of express consent is Article 6 (1a) of the GDPR; correspondingly, the remarks on consent in (III) apply. The legal basis for the use of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing by post is Art. 6 (1f) of the GDPR (legitimate interest); the legitimate interest here consists in addressing potential customers for the purpose of direct advertising for our products and services. For advertising and/or marketing measures via email for the purpose of direct advertising for similar wares or services of our own, the legal basis is Section 7(3) of the German Fair Trade Practices Act (UWG); this is subject to the condition that (i) we received your email address in connection with the sale of a good or service, (ii) you did not refuse to allow your email address to be used for the purpose of direct advertising and (iii) upon the collection of your email address and every time we use it, we clearly point out that you may refuse at any time to have your email address used in this way (on the right to refuse, see [XI.6]).
Your personal data will be stored and used for advertising purposes indefinitely, depending on the respective legal basis for the advertising measure (consent or legitimate interest), until you object to the use of your data for advertising purposes or until you revoke your corresponding consent. You can revoke consent to a processing of personal data at any time, with effect for the future. You may object to processing on the basis of legitimate interests at any time; a right of objection exists in particular in the case of profiling in accordance with Art. 21 of the GDPR. In the event of revocation and/or objection, the personal data will no longer be processed for the purposes concerned; with the exception of processing of data which is still required for the purpose of fulfilling the contract (Art. 6 (1b) of the GDPR) including statutory storage obligations and/or if the data is still required within the framework of legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1b) GDPR) (e.g. in the event of an advertising objection, processing of data in a so-called blacklist in order to prevent future advertising approaches).
