The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to assist you in understanding the type of personal information we may collect from you, how such information may be used, and the choices that are available to you concerning the use of your information.
BY INTERACTING WITH US THROUGH OUR STORES, TELEPHONE, WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED OR SUBMITTED AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US OR USE OUR WEBSITE OR COMMUNICATE WITH US ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.
WE MAY MAKE CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME OR ADD TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, SO WE ASK YOU TO REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME SO THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH OUR CURRENT PRIVACY PRACTICES.
Note that the examples contained in this Privacy Policy are illustrations only, and not intended to be exhaustive.
Personal information We Collect
Avenue collects information from a variety of sources, including: information you provide to us, transaction information, information we collect via technology-enabled services, and information we collect about you from third-party sources.
In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means any data or information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.
The information we collect depends on how you interact with us, and may include the following:
Information You Provide to Us. Avenue collects information you provide to us, when using our Website, through our retail operations, or otherwise. For example, if you place an order or register on our Website, and provide your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card or other payment related information, you are voluntarily providing us your personal information. We also collect information you submit when participating in our various services, promotions, programs or surveys, or when seeking support from us in the use of our products and services. In addition, we collect and maintain information about your transactions with us, such as shopping history and preferences.
Device Data. Each time you visit our Website, or Social Media platforms our servers may automatically collect certain information describing your visit, including your IP address and browser information. By itself, an IP address is not personally identifiable, however this information may be combined with other personal information and we may maintain a record of your products interests and purchases you make in our stores or online.
Location Data. We collect data about your location, which can be either precise or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots we collect when you enable location-based products or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a specific store location, city or postal code level.
Information from Other Sources. Avenue also receives information about you from publicly available sources, from other companies, joint-marketing partners or from unrelated third-parties including, but not limited to information on your creditworthiness for private label credit card offers, and products you may be interested in purchasing.
How We Use Personal Information
Avenue uses the information we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below: (1) to operate our business and provide the products we offer, (2) to send communications, including promotional communications, and (3) in connection with advertising. Some of the specific uses are as follows:
Operating our Business. We use information to provide and improve the products we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes operating the stores and the Website, delivering purchased products, maintaining and improving the selection of products, including developing new features, research, and providing customer support. This also includes sharing personal information with third parties who provide services to us, such as credit card processing, order fulfillment, website analytics and management, marketing management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, e-mail delivery, auditing, and other similar services.
Communications. We use information we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform you about products that may be of interest, or orders in process and returns, remind you about items left in your online shopping cart, update you or inquire about a return request, invite you to participate in a survey, or tell you that you need to take action to keep your account active. Additionally, you can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Avenue by email, by text messaging, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing email subscriptions and promotional communications, please see the Opt-Out Choices for Communications from Avenue section of this Privacy Policy, below.
Advertising. We may use your personal information to notify you about new products, and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Website visit, marketing experience, and communications may be tailored to your interests based on your personal information. We may also use personal information in order to respond directly to your information requests. We may use your Personal Information to deliver customized advertising to you on the Website, on other websites and on other digital and offline media channels, including Social Media platforms. Please see the Third-Party Advertising and Marketing and Advertising Services sections of this Privacy Policy, below, for related information.
Reasons We Share Personal Information
We share your personal information with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have purchased, requested or authorized. For example, we share your address with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you order an item through our Website and ask us to deliver it. When you provide payment information to make a purchase, we will share payment information with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.
In addition, we share personal information with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. See the Marketing and Advertising Services section of this Privacy Policy, below, for more information. For example, companies we hire to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies are only authorized to use personal information they receive from us for the purposes for which they are engaged. We also may disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger, consolidation, restructuring, reorganization or sale of some or all of Avenue’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of an insolvency proceeding, in which your personal information will be among the assets transferred or consolidated.
Finally, we will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal information, when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
operate and maintain the security of our stores, Website, and other facilities, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or
protect the rights or property of Avenue, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services - however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Avenue, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.

Do Not Track
Avenue does not directly track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites, including some suppliers to Avenue, do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. See the support information for your browser to learn how to handle DNT signals.
Third parties that have content embedded on Avenue’s websites such as a social feature may set cookies on a user’s browser or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Website from a certain IP address, for example.

If you are under 13 years of age, please do not provide your information on the Website. If the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 believes that the child has provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us (see Contact Information, below) to have this personal information deleted from our files. If we learn that we have obtained personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to delete that information from our files.
Security of Personal Information
Avenue is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.

We want your online shopping experience to be safe and secure. We encrypt your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card number when transmitting over the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software.

When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."
PLEASE NOTE THAT NORMAL EMAIL (SUCH AS USING CONTACT US OR YOUR HOME EMAIL) IS NOT ENCRYPTED AND THUS IS NOT A SECURE MEANS FOR TRANSMITTING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR INFORMATION YOU WISH TO KEEP PRIVATE AND SECURE.
