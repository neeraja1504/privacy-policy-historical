AviationCareer.net has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for www.aviationcareer.net.
Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (such as their email address). We use this contact information from the registration forms to transmit our weekly newsletter, and also to send the users other relevant information. This information may be also used to contact the user if that becomes necessary. We may also collect demographic information in order to allow us to refine our website and newsletter to better serve our audience. Any information provided is at the users' own option.
We do not release individual user data to any third parties. The demographic and profile data that are collected at our site may be made available to others on an aggregate basis only (e.g. we may provide information such as "70% of our users are located in the United States"), but we do not release information that is specific to a single user.
Cookies
Our ad serving system may use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a random number user ID that the site assigns to a visitor to track the pages they have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
Cookies allows us to measure and report aggregate information to site advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency). They also allow us to deliver ads that are more relevant to visitors and avoid delivering the same ads too many times to one visitor. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Our ad serving program will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable.
If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible by cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.
