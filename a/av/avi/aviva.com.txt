Privacy Policy - Aviva
What “we” means This privacy policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva Group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva Group that  processes  your  personal information.
We have separate privacy notices for our products
If you’re one of our customers, we will give you separate privacy notices when we ask for your  personal information , for example, when you get a quote or apply for our products. Read them carefully, as they’ll tell you which Aviva company is responsible for managing your  personal information  and provide more details about how we’ll use it in relation to that product.
You’ll find more privacy notices when you use our apps and platforms such as Drive or MyAviva. This Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.
We’ll keep this Policy up to date with the latest legal requirements, so please check back here for the current version.
Sensitive information
Sometimes we’ll ask about your  health,  details of  offences and convictions  or other sensitive information about the person(s) who is/are being insured and their family members. We know how sensitive that data is, so protecting it is a top priority.
Payment information
If you buy a product directly from our website or other Aviva sales channel, we’ll ask for  payment information. We need this to complete your purchase. __
Marketing and customer insights
We carry out customer insight analysis from our interactions with you to help improve our products and services, and keep you informed about offerings that may be of interest to you.
Information about other individuals
Most of the information we collect relates to the person taking out a product (or persons where it’s taken out jointly). We may also ask for information about other individuals if we need it. Examples include:
if you ask us to provide insurance for other household or family members, or members of a group
if we ask an  insured person  to provide  health information  about other family members where this is relevant to the risk we’re covering when we  arrange  a policy
if we need information about other individuals when we handle a  claim , such as injured third parties
If you provide us with information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission. We’ll  process  their  personal information  according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.
