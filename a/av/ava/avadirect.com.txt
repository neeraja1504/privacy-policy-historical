Transaction Security
AVADirect recognizes your right for privacy and full confidentiality while shopping online. All sensitive data such as billing and shipping information are securely encrypted using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption protocol. AVADirect is committed to providing an up-to-date secure environment for online consumers. Therefore, the AVADirect.com web site is registered with independent site identification authorities. Trustwave Global Certificate Authority (CA) confirms both parties’ identities before any transmission is sent and the Trustwave SSL Certificate helps give all parties the confidence that information is being sent securely and to the right place.
Fraud Protection
For your online shopping, AVADirect is committed to data security and protects the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide via stringent controls.
We strongly encourage all shipments are processed only to the verified billing address as a measure to minimize risk of fraud credit card usage.
For Customer purchases made with a credit card, AVADirect will only ship product to the verified billing address or an authorized shipping address that is registered with the Customer's credit card. (With proper customer authorization, alternative shipping addresses, other than the billing address, can be registered with credit card companies. Contact your credit card company for further information.)
