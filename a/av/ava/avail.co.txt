Privacy | Avail
Rentalutions, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, dba Avail ("Avail", "we" or "us"), appreciates your use of the Website and Services. We know that privacy is important, so we are providing this Privacy Policy to communicate our policies with respect to your information when you use the Avail Website or Services. Any defined terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or Services. By accessing or using the Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
Information Collection and Use
When you register to use the Services, you provide personal information to set up your account, such as: your name, title, optional photo, email address, birthdate, primary phone number, secondary phone number, emergency phone number, fax number, and mailing address. If you are a property manager (rather than an individual), you may also provide company information, such as: your company name, logo, website url, and number of units managed. All of this information is referred to as your “ Account Information ”.
If you are a Tenant and wish to submit a rental application for a unit on the Service, you will provide typical personal information necessary for the Manager to evaluate your application, such as: your name, email address, birthdate, primary phone number, secondary phone number, emergency phone number, mailing address, tenant history (including past addresses and landlord information), whether you have pets and how many, your vehicle information, your employment history, your current income information, whether or not you smoke, whether you have filed for bankruptcy in the past seven years, whether you have been convicted of a felony, whether you have ever been evicted from a tenancy, and whether you have ever refused to pay rent. All of this information is referred to as “ Tenant Application Information ”.
Tenants who submit a rental application for a unit will also be redirected from our Website to the site of a third-party service provider to provide personal information, such as social security number and name, to allow that third-party service provider to run a Background Check to be used in the rental application. Neither Avail nor the Manager has access to the information you provide to the third-party service provider (notably your social security number) in order to perform the Background Check nor does Avail store this information on our servers. You will authorize this third-party service provider to share the results of the Background Check (the “Background Check Results”) with Rentaltuions and the Manager who owns or manages the unit you wish to rent. Once the Background Check Results are complete, the third-party service provider will grant Avail access to the Background Check Results via a secure API, and Avail will share the Background Check Results with the Manager through the Service for his evaluation of your rental application. The Manager will only have access to the Background Check Results until the rental application has been evaluated (accepted or rejected) by Manager. Avail does not store the Background Check Results on our servers nor will Avail retain a copy of the Background Check Results after the rental application has been evaluated (accepted or rejected) by the Manager. Under our Terms of Use, Manager is required to keep your personal Background Check Results private and only use it in connection with the lawful use of the Services.
If you choose to use the ACH payment features of the Services, you will provide personal information required for Avail to process the ACH you request, such as: your bank name, bank routing number, account number, and account holder's name. This information is referred to as your “ ACH Information ”. Avail will store your ACH Information on secure servers unless you ask us to delete your ACH Information by contacting us at support@avail.co.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” shall include Account Information, Tenant Application Information, Background Check Results and ACH Information. At your request, we use your Personal Information to provide the Services on the Website. We may use your Personal Information to contact you to notify you of new services, changes to the Service or third-party services that may be of interest to you. Except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties.
We also collect “ Non-Identifying Information ” about you, which includes Aggregate Information, Public Information, and Usage Details. This is information that cannot reasonably be used to contact or identify you unless it is coupled with other information. We may aggregate non-personal statistical information that does not individually identify you, such as information concerning gender, location or average rent (“ Aggregate Information ”). We collect this information directly, such as when you register and indirectly, such as when you use the website or through our third-party service providers. The Aggregate Information we collect is pooled together to help us improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns; store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests; speed up your searches; and recognize you when you return to our Website.
You also may provide us with information that you ask us to make public by publishing or displaying the information on public areas of the Website or by sharing with third-party sites (“ Public Information ”). This includes information such as comments on the Website's blog or information about a unit that you list on the Website for rental promotion, including unit information such as: unit type, building name, street name and cross street, address, package delivery, amenities, rent amount, security deposit amount, and optional photos.
Finally, we collect non-personal statistical information about your internet connection, the equipment that you use to access our Website and how you use our website (“Usage Details”). This information is then pooled to allow us to optimize the Website to the internet connections and equipment that is used to visit the Website. We collect this information both directly from you when you provide it to us and automatically as you navigate through and interact with our Website, (i) including details of your visits to our Website, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website and (ii) information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type.

Third-party Service Providers
We use several third-party service providers in order to efficiently provide our Services to you. These services include such things as web hosting, credit card payment processing, ACH payment processing, email management, maintenance contractor scouting, and Background Check processing. For more information on how Background Checks are handled, please read the section on Background Checks above in Collected Information and Use ). Some third-party service providers will collect information directly from you and provide us with relevant data (such as credit card processing companies and the third-party Background Check provider). We may use this information to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection. Information collected from these third-party services is governed by their privacy policies. You should view the privacy policy of third-party service providers before providing information to them. Other times, we will provide Non-Identifying Information to third-parties in order to enhance our Services. For instance, our Services utilize an API that integrates with Yelp to help Managers find contractors to handle maintenance requests. In order to accomplish this, we provide your ZIP code and a general description of the maintenance request to Yelp in order to facilitate a search of relevant service providers. If you do not want to share your information in this way, you should not use the Website or Services. Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you interact with a third-party, the third-party may have access to your Personal Information.
