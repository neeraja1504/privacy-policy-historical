Data We Collect
We collect personal data of our workers, job candidates, suppliers, business contacts, shareholders and website users.

Whatever happens, we will only process that data if we consider it fair and lawful to do so. Except for certain information that we are required to collect by law, your decision to provide any personal data to us is voluntary.

These third parties may include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers and vendors.
