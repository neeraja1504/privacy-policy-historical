Information we collect
In order to meet our customers' needs effectively we need to collect certain personal information. We will collect the following: name, address, date of birth, contact details, income, assets, liabilities, account balances, employment details, tax and financial statements, trading statements and any other relevant information.
Most of the information comes directly from our customers through application forms and other requests for information, although we may from time to time obtain information from third party sources.
We may request other information to be supplied voluntarily in order to expand or develop our services to meet the need of existing and potential customers.
Should you choose not to provide information which we request, we may not be able to provide the service or product you require.
Use of Information
We use the information primarily to establish and manage your account, review your needs and provide you with information regarding opportunities which we believe may be of interest to you.
We also use it to identify you when you contact us.
We may send you marketing information from time to time by email, telephone or other electronic messaging media unless you contact us to notify us that you do not wish to receive this information.
We disclose your information to our group companies and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf, for debit card validation and to credit agencies and fraud prevention agencies.
We do not sell, rent or exchange your personal information with any third party for commercial reasons.
Where required by law, your personal information may also be disclosed to an applicable governmental agency, regulatory body or enforcement authority.
These agencies may then use your personal information in respect of any alleged breach of law or regulatory rules.
Management and Storage of Information
Our employees are trained to respect the confidentiality of customer information and we are committed to maintaining the security of the data we collect. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse, incorrect exposure or alteration of the information.
