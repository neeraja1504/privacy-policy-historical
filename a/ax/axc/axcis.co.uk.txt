This Privacy Notice applies to all job applicants, candidates and contractors.
The Company is committed to being transparent about how it handles your personal information, to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information and to meeting its data protection obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.  The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to make you aware of how and why we will collect and use your personal information during the recruitment process. We are required under the GDPR to notify you of the information contained in this Privacy Notice.
The Company has appointed a Data Protection Officer and a Data Controller to oversee compliance with this Privacy Notice.  If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice or about how we handle your personal information, please contact the HR Director (the Company's Data Protection Officer) or the HR & Training Manager (the Company's Data Controller).  Contact details are provided at the end of this document.
2.0        Data protection principles
Under the GDPR there are six data protection principles that the Company must comply with. These provide that the personal information we hold about you must be:
Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.
Collected only for legitimate purposes that have been clearly explained to you and not further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes.
Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to those purposes.
Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
Kept in a form which permits your identification for no longer than is necessary for those purposes.
Processed in a way that ensures appropriate security of the data.
The Company is responsible for following these requirements and must be able to prove compliance in order to demonstrate accountability.
3.0        What types of personal information do we collect about you?
Personal information is any information about an individual from which that person can be directly or indirectly identified.  It does not include anonymised data, i.e. where all identifying particulars have been removed.  There are also special categories of personal information and personal information on criminal convictions and offences, which require a higher level of protection because it is of a more sensitive nature.  The special categories of personal information comprise information about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex life or sexual orientation and genetic and biometric data.
The Company collects, uses and processes a range of personal information about you during the recruitment process. This includes:
your contact details, including your:
name;

telephone number
personal e-mail address.

4.0        How do we collect your personal information?
The Company collects personal information about you during the recruitment process either directly from you or via aggregated job boards e.g. Indeed. We may also collect personal information from other external third parties, such as references from current and former employers and criminal record checks from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).  The Company will only seek personal information from third parties during the application process. You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide personal information to the Company during the recruitment process.
Your personal information may be stored in different places, including on your application record, in the Company’s HR management system and in other IT systems, such as the e-mail system.

We need all the types of personal information listed under “What types of personal information do we collect about you?” primarily to enable us to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with you, or to place you into employment and to enable us to comply with our legal obligations.  In some cases, we may also use your personal information where it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our interests.
Our legitimate interests include:
pursuing our business by employing workers, contractors, consultants and interims;

We may also occasionally use your special categories of personal information, and information about any criminal convictions and offences, where it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

12.0      Your rights in connection with your personal information
As a data subject you have a number of statutory rights. Subject to certain conditions, and in certain circumstances, you have the right to:
request access to your personal information - this is usually known as ‘making a data subject access request’ and it enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are processing it lawfully;
request rectification of your personal information - this enables you to have any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you corrected;
request the erasure of your personal information - this enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing, e.g. it is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected;
restrict the processing of your personal information - this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information, e.g. if you contest its accuracy and so want us to verify its accuracy;
object to the processing of your personal information - this enables you to ask us to stop processing your personal information where we are relying on the legitimate interests of the business as our legal basis for processing and there is something relating to your particular situation which makes you decide to object to processing on this ground;
data portability - this gives you the right to request the transfer of your personal information to another party so that you can reuse it across different services for your own purposes.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Controller or Data Protection Officer .We may need to request specific information from you in order to verify your identity and check your right to access the personal information or to exercise any of your other rights.  This is a security measure to ensure that your personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
In the limited circumstances where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.  This will not, however, affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.  If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact our Data Controller or Data Protection Officer.  Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal information for the purpose you originally agreed to, unless we have another legal basis for processing.
If you believe that the Company has not complied with your data protection rights, you have the right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at any time.  The ICO is the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.
13.0      Transferring personal information outside the European Economic Area

To ensure that your personal information receives the adequate level of protection, it is transferred outside the EEA on the basis of appropriate or suitable safeguards, e.g. binding corporate rules or GDPR compliant data protection clauses.
14.0      Automated decision making
Automated decision making occurs when an electronic system uses your personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We do not envisage that any recruitment decisions will be taken about you based solely on automated decision-making, including profiling
