Privacy & Security

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience.
When you register, we need to know your name, e-mail address, and delivery address. This information is then used every time you order.
We also need your telephone number that enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. For some international deliveries this number may be given to our couriers.
We personalise your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations to future customers. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us modify our store and add new features.
Cookies - During your use of our website, our server will write small files to your browser. These are called cookies. This allows us to track which pages of our website you visit and enables key parts of the shopping functionality.
You may turn cookies off in your browser, but this may prevent you from using certain features of our site.
We will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting our terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
