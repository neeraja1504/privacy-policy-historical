Where we store your personal data

Order fulfilment
Payment processing
Technical support services.
If your personal data cannot be processed within the EEA, we will:
Comply with all other data protection principles
Where possible, be to a country that is on the list of the EU Commissions’ countries that provide adequate protections for the rights and freedoms of data subjects
If the transfer is to the United States of America, we will use reasonable endeavours to make sure they participate in the Privacy Shield program
Make sure we have assessed the adequacy of protections in all other cases.
Access to your stored personal data via password
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Transmission and storage of your personal data
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we use best practice to ensure your data is encrypted to the standard required in the GDPR to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it is transmitted and stored.
How long will you keep my personal information?
AXELOS will not retain your personal information for longer than required.
We will keep your personal information:
For as long as required by law
Until we no longer have a valid reason for keeping it
Until you request us to stop using it.
We may keep just enough of your personal information to ensure that we comply with your requests not to use your personal information or comply with your right to erasure. For example, we must keep your request to be erased even if it includes your personal data until such time as you are no longer our customer.
If you have questions about our Data Retention Policy, please contact: dpo@axelos.com.
What if I chose not to give you my personal information?
If the personal information is necessary in order to supply goods or services to you under a contract between you and AXELOS, then we will not enter into that contract or provide the services or goods if you do not give us your personal information.
