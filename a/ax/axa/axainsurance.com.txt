Further information
Your privacy is important to us and we promise we will respect your personal information. We will use your information to manage your insurance with us, including underwriting, claims handling, No Claims Discount entitlement and statistical analysis. This may include disclosing your information within the AXA Group and to agents, suppliers, other insurers, or reinsurers who provide services on our behalf.
We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the AXA Group except:
Where we have your permission; or
Where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or
To other companies who provide a service to us or you which includes proof of No Claims Discount (NCD) entitlement; or
Where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.
We may transfer your information to other countries including those located outside the European Economic Area. If we do this we will seek to ensure that anyone to whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection.

Using your online account
When you set up your first policy with AXA, you need to set up an online account (My AXA Account). In My AXA Account, you can:
View and print all your policy information and documents
Securely make changes to your policy yourself whenever you want
To set up and use My AXA Account, you'll need:
Your email address, which you give us when you buy your policy
A memorable password which you can choose
To answer an additional security question when you first set up your account
By using the same email address when buying additional AXA policies, your new documents will be stored to your existing online account. You can then view all your details in the same AXA Account. If you prefer your new policy to be saved in a different online account, you will need to use a different email address.
We recommend that you do not share your account details with anyone. If you do give your email address and password to another person, they will have all your privileges, and will be able to view or change your cover or details. In these instances you will be responsible for their actions, and AXA cannot accept any responsibility for any adjustment made without your authority.
Because circumstances can change, you should review your access details regularly to make sure they are still appropriate for you and anyone you have given permission to access your account.
To set up a separate account for one or more of your existing policies, please contact our help team.
If we’re contacted by phone we won’t discuss the policy with anybody other than the policyholder unless we already have their explicit consent. See  Dealing with other people below.

Fraud prevention agencies
To keep premiums low we participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time:
Approach the DVLA to check all or any relevant driving licence details of anyone named on the policy;
Share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
Share information about you and any other named drivers on the policy within the AXA Group and with other insurers;
Pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, CUE, CIFAS and all DVLA databases) where those details will be checked and updated;
Check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy information and electoral role data). If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering;
Periodically search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies to:
help make decisions about credit services for you and your financial associates
help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your financial associates;
trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies
check your identity to prevent money laundering.
For more information about the agencies with which we share your data, including further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies may be used, please email us at informationsharing@axa.com.
If you would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please refer to the Further information section below.

If you then continue to use a service or product for a further 60 days we will assume you have consented to the changes.

Motor Insurance Database
When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad, other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.
Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the Motor Insurance Bureau.

We make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register and credit information. The agencies may record details of the search whether or not this application proceeds. We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. Searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance applications and claims. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.

Use of personal information for marketing purposes
The information you supply may be used by us, other members of the AXA Group and carefully selected third parties for research purposes or to inform you of other products or services that may be of interest to you, unless you have advised us otherwise. On each occasion that we contact you for these purposes, you will always be given the option to opt out of any further communication.
Please note that we have the ability to retain any data that you provide on this website, even if you do not complete your quote by clicking submit/next. Such contact details and data may be used to contact you to enquire why you did not complete your quote. If you have any questions about this, please contact us.

Dealing with other people
If your spouse or partner contacts us on your behalf, due to data protection, we will be unable to answer their queries. However, if you require your spouse, partner or another third party to be able to discuss your policy, please contact the  help team and inform us of whom you would like to speak on your behalf. However, this will exclude them from being able to cancel the policy as we require to speak to the policyholder regarding cancellations.
In some exceptional circumstances we may also deal with other people who contact us on your behalf.
We will not reveal any credit or debit card numbers to anyone other than the policyholder.

Automatic renewals
Most AXA insurance customers benefit from the convenience of our automatic renewal service. Around 25 days before your renewal date we’ll email you your renewal invitation, which will also be stored in your AXA Account online for you to view or amend. If the cover’s right for you for another year, you don’t need to do anything. It’s the hassle-free way of keeping great value insurance with AXA. If you do not want to renew, just call us before your policy expiry date.
How does it work?
We securely retain your payment details and if you don’t contact us we will renew your policy automatically for you.
Does everyone qualify for this service?
Although most customers can benefit, not all policies can be automatically renewed - single trip travel insurance for instance. If you are unsure whether you qualify, you can contact us.
