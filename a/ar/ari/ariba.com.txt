Privacy Statement for SAP Ariba
Protecting the individual's privacy on the Internet is crucial to the future of Internet-based business and the move toward a true Internet economy. We have created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to the individual`s right to data protection and privacy. This Privacy Statement outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual ("Personal Data").
Note : The SAP Ariba Privacy Statement for Cloud Services available at http://www.ariba.com/legal/privacy-policy describes SAP Ariba practices for processing personal data submitted to the SAP Ariba Cloud Services by customers.
A. General Information
When does this Privacy Statement apply? This Privacy Statement applies to Personal Data that you provide to SAP Ariba or which is derived from the Personal Data as outlined below. The use of any information that is gathered by cookies or other web tracking technologies is subject to the disclosures and options provided in this Privacy Statement.  This policy applies to the websites and services that reference it including www.ariba.com and the SAP Ariba customer support systems (SAP Ariba Connect and SAP Ariba Community services).
Data Controller. The data controller of www.ariba.com is Ariba Inc., 3420 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“SAP Ariba”). The SAP Group’s data protection officer is Mathias Cellarius (privacy@sap.com).
What does SAP Ariba do with my Personal Data? SAP Ariba will process the Personal Data provided hereunder only as set out in this Privacy Statement. Further information can be found in Sections B. and C. below. Where the processing of your Personal Data is based on a statutory permission, you can find information on which Personal Data SAP Ariba is processing or using for which purposes in Section B below. Where consent for the processing of your Personal Data is required you can find further information in Section C. below. This information matches with the respective consent statements pertaining to individual processing operations in the Consent Resource Center.
Duration of processing of Personal Data. Where SAP Ariba is processing and using your Personal Data as permitted by law (see B. below) or under your consent (see C. below), SAP Ariba will store your Personal Data (i) only for as long as is required to fulfil the purposes set out below or (ii) until you object to SAP Ariba’s use of your Personal Data (where SAP Ariba has a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data), or (iii) until you withdraw your consent (where you consented to SAP Ariba using your Personal Data). However, where SAP Ariba is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer or where your Personal Data is required for SAP Ariba to assert or defend against legal claims, SAP Ariba will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.
Why am I required to provide Personal Data? As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Data hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Data. However, there are circumstances in which SAP Ariba cannot take action without certain Personal Data, for example because this Personal Data is required to process your orders, provide you with direct support assistance or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for SAP Ariba to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Data.
Where will my Personal Data be processed? As part of a global group of companies, SAP Ariba has affiliates and third-party service providers within as well as outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). As a consequence, whenever SAP Ariba is using or otherwise processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, SAP Ariba may transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your Personal Data is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA. You may obtain a redacted copy (from which commercial information and information that is not relevant has been removed) of such Standard Contractual Clauses by sending a request to privacy@sap.com.
Data subjects ’ rights. You can request from SAP Ariba at any time information about which Personal Data SAP Ariba processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data. Please note, however, that SAP Ariba can delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SAP Ariba to retain it. Kindly note that if you request that SAP Ariba delete your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to use any SAP Ariba service that requires SAP **** Ariba’s use of your Personal Data.
If SAP Ariba uses your Personal Data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from SAP Ariba a copy of the Personal Data that you have provided to SAP. In this case, please contact the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates and whether the Personal Data is to be sent to you or another recipient. SAP Ariba will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how it can best fulfill it.
Furthermore, you can request from SAP Ariba that SAP Ariba restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data SAP Ariba has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as SAP Ariba requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data), (ii) there is no legal basis for SAP Ariba processing your Personal Data and you demand that SAP Ariba restricts your Personal Data from further processing, (iii) SAP Ariba no longer requires your Personal Data but you claim that you require SAP Ariba to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by SAP Ariba (based on SAP **** Ariba’s legitimate interest as further set out in B. below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether SAP Ariba has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.
Please post such requests at https://support.ariba.com/privacy-request.
Right to lodge a complaint. If you believe that SAP Ariba is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which SAP Ariba has its registered seat.

Links to other websites. This website may contain links to foreign (meaning non-SAP Ariba Group companies) websites. SAP Ariba is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites outside the SAP Ariba Group of companies. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully read the privacy statements of such foreign sites.
Automated Tools. In addition to the information you provide, SAP may also collect information during your visit to a SAP website through Automated Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an SAP website. Using these tools, SAP Ariba can also track other information such as pages visited on the relevant SAP Ariba site and certain other aggregate data that is not related to a particular individual.
Sitecore. Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use the Sitecore Experience Manager platform to personalize content on the website.It does this based on observe visitor behavior, such as how many clicks a visitor has on certain types of content, or how long a visitor has spent in certain sections of the site, or how many pages of a certain type a visitor has views.It also uses information (a profile ID) from Marketo to determine more granular personalization’s.The data that goes into the profile is only store in Marketo and does not exist in Sitecore.Users may prevent Sitecore’s personalization by opting out of cookies (see below).
Demandbase. Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use tools from Demandbase for the following tasks:
Forms. used to provide data for forms. When someone’s IP resolves to a company IP address, a number of data points from Demandbase are inserted into the form and those fields are hidden automatically. Additionally, when a visitor enters their email address into a form, the domain name portion of the email address is sent to Demandbase as well, however when data is returned in this way, it is inserted into the form but the fields thus completed are not hidden.In both cases, this data includes Annual Revenue, Company Size, Company Name, Business Phone Number, Business Address. This data is entirely on the client (browser) until and unless the user submits a form, at which point this data along with any other data entered into the form is transmitted directly to our Marketing Automation platform.
Analytics. used to enrich web analytics. Every web request sends request data to Adobe Analytics (see below). Demandbase is used to enrich data with the same sort of data described under “Forms” above.As with Forms, only visitors whose IP address resolves to a corporate IP has any of this data transmitted to Adobe Analytics.
Chat. Used to enrich and better target chat interactions. We use the LiveEngage platform from LivePerson. There are two parts to this, one currently in use (#1) and another is a project that is currently underway (#2).
Reactive Chat. When a user clicks a control to open a chat session, and they have Demandbase data available, the company name and the company’s annual revenue amount is transmitted to the LiveEngage platform where chat representatives can better route that chat request.
Proactive chat. By using the Demandbase data, we can proactively prompt users to engage in a chat session based on their corporate information.
Demandbase Data is acquired via IP GeoLocation. IP addresses that resolve to corporate IPs in Demandbase’s company registry return a block of data about that company. IPs that do not resolve to a corporate IP address return only IP Geolocation data (IP country of origin, lat/long, etc) in which case, no acquired data is recorded or stored.
Adobe Analytics. Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Adobe Analytics. Adobe Analytics is using IP addresses to establish the approximate region where a user is coming from. Therefore, Adobe Analytics is collecting the full IP address of users in a first step and then anonymizes it in a second step. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from where a user is accessing a certain website.
Furthermore, if you are a registered user and logged on, SAP uses Adobe Analytics to track your user ID together with how you use the relevant website.
You can opt-out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link: http://ariba.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&confirm_change=1
Usage tracking for marketing purposes. Certain SAP websites may collect the way you are accessing and using such websites by other means in order to prepare pseudonymous usage profiles that are used to determine which content is the most appropriate to be displayed while you visit a certain website.
In this case, SAP is capturing your usage behavior together with a unique identifier (that allows SAP to establish that there is a certain person active on its websites) but no information like your name that can be used to directly identify you. SAP will use the collected information only in order to display appropriate and relevant content on its websites. Each SAP website making use of such tracking mechanism will contain further information about the collected information as well as an opt-out choice.
Cookies. Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a site via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. SAP uses cookies to deliver personalized content, to save you having to re-enter your password or complete registration forms repeatedly, to keep track of your shopping cart, and to tailor our information offerings to how you and others use the site.
