Arise receives information from your devices, including IP address, location, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers, push notification tokens, and, if you register with your social media account (such as Facebook, Google or LinkedIn), your applicable social media identifier.
Biometric Data. Arise may collect, store, use, and derive biometric data from your submitted pictures, driver's license, or government-issued ID. Arise will use this data to confirm your identity from time to time.

To help us understand how you use the Arise Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive information about your interactions with the Arise Platform, like the pages or other content you view, your actions within the Arise Platform, and the dates and times of your visits.

Call, Email and Text Information. We work with third-party partners to facilitate calls, emails and text messages to you.

We will share your information with such partners to facilitate these communications and to help us provide services on the Arise Platform.
Third Party Analytics. We use third party technologies, such as Facebook Analytics and Google Analytics, to help us to understand how you use the website and Arise Platform and ways that we can improve your experience. These technologies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content and improve the Arise platform and your experience. We also use social media buttons and plugins that allow you to connect with your social network in various ways, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.  These sites may set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies.

Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies. Arise is continuously improving the Arise Platform through the use of various third-party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems.
