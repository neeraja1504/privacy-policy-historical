Privacy Policy // arenamate.net - Your WoW Legion S7 PvP Hub
We recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here are details on what data is collected, why it is collected, and how it is used.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
With the GDPR taking effect on May 25, 2018, it is no longer allowed to collect and process "personal data" from European Union (EU) residents without their consent, a certain purpose and the possibility to delete it on request.
Since online gaming characters and/or accounts might fall under that definition, as treated by several sources ([1], [2]), we implemented some drastic changes to respect the new regulations:
We will no longer be targeting the EU as a "market place".
Any data relating to EU characters (Russian and CIS ones excluded) has been deleted and will no longer be crawled.
All accounts with at least one EU character (Russian and CIS ones excluded) on them have been permanently deleted and will not be able to sign in again.
You can now delete your account.
Log files were either completely disabled and deleted where possible (web server) or IP anonymization was activated.
If necessary, there will be further action to fully comply with the GDPR. This might lead to additional restrictions regarding the functionality of this website.
Game Data
The sole purpose of this website is to collect and process game data from World of Warcraft (WoW) relating to Player versus Player (PvP) activities.
Character data, which is shown on the ladders, consists of the names of characters, their defining attributes (like the class), their ratings and ranks as well as their seasonal performances. Character profiles provide additional information including achievements, other characters that belong to to the same player (so called "alts"), and the amount of games that were played during a certain period of time. Some of this data is combined to derive additional statistics (like class representation or player activity).
Account data, which is gathered after you signed in using Blizzard's Battle.net, includes your BattleTag, all player characters you follow on arenamate, all max level characters owned by you on WoW, creation time, last login time, and additional (optional) information (like your Twitter username).
As already stated, we do not collect any of this data if it can be referred to as personal data from EU residents. Also, we do not sell any of this data to third parties.
Cookies
We use cookies, which are small text files placed on your computer, to store certain preferences.
A basic set of cookies is necessary to keep track of your current session across the website (e.g. so you don't have to sign in over and over again) and to make some smaller things work (like remembering your choice about which cookies may be used or showing you a popup only once).
Tracking cookies are utilized to better understand your usage of the website.
Google Analytics
arenamate uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (Google). Google Analytics uses tracking cookies to help us analyze how users interact with the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States (US).
Google will use this information on behalf of arenamate for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
IP-anonymization is active on this website, which means your IP-address will be truncated within the area of Member States of the EU or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA).
You can opt out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Addon for your current web browser.
