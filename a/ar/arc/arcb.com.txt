ArcBest Corporation and its subsidiaries, (collectively “ArcBest,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) are committed to respecting your privacy. We use the information we collect via ARCB.com and our other web properties, domains, and websites to provide you a positive customer experience, inform you of relevant logistics solutions and provide the most robust online tools and applications in the transportation industry.  This Privacy Policy applies to ArcBest websites that link to or reference this Policy and describes how we handle your information collected through such sites. By visiting our website or using any of our services, you consent to ArcBest’s collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. ArcBest may review and update this Privacy Policy without prior notice. If we change this Privacy Policy, the updated policy will be posted to this page and the date first written above shall indicate its effective date.
What information does ArcBest collect?
We may collect data, including personal information, about you as you use our websites, services, and interact with us. Examples of personal information we may collect includes names, business title, addresses, e-mail addresses, preferences, information necessary to fulfill requests, and telephone numbers. We may also collect information that is related to you but that does not personally identify you.
We collect such data for many reasons, including but not limited to: processing a transaction, providing you with information about your transaction, enabling the use of certain web tools, providing you information about other services available, providing customer service, or responding to your inquiries. We may also collect and use such data in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and for benchmarking and analysis.
We may also collect IP addresses, usage statistics, browser information and other information generated by your use of our websites through the use of cookies, web logs, beacons, and other similar tools. This information allows us to understand and improve the customer experience on our websites and for administration, personalization, security, and analysis purposes.
In order to provide services to you and improve ArcBest’s websites, we may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to ArcBest, these third-party vendors may need to collect information about you or we may need to provide Your information to them.
ArcBest may also collect information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records and improve the quality or personalization of our services to you.
While not always collected through our websites we collect and store information about every shipment and transaction handled by us so that we can efficiently provide the services you require.

How is my information saved and protected?
We employ physical, administrative and technical safeguards and security techniques to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, the Internet is not 100% secure and we cannot guarantee or warrant that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose your information, therefore we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Because of the nature of transportation and logistics services and the varied parties involved in providing services to you, we cannot maintain complete confidentiality of information that is printed and placed in plain view on a shipment or package or that is required to be disclosed in order to arrange, perform, or manage services for you.
How do I change my personal or company information?
