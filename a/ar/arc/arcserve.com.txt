Scope
This Policy applies to all information collected by Arcserve LLC from which an individual can be identified (“Personal Information”). The Personal Information we collect includes the Employee Information described below as well as certain information including names, email addresses, mailing and billing addresses and telephone and fax numbers collected from customers, potential customers and end users of our products and services for sales, marketing, order fulfilment and order delivery purposes. Additionally, in our section on Online Information we also discuss how we gather and use all information gathered online even if it is not Personal Information. Arcserve LLC will not deviate from this Policy even if applicable national laws are less stringent than this Policy.
Notice
Excluding our Employee Information which is discussed below, we collect, process and use your Personal Information only as a part of our business relationship with you and your company, including contract and billing administration; product and service delivery; fulfilling our business obligations to our customers and resellers; communicating with customers and potential customers about marketing and technical information concerning our products and services; notifying our customers and potential customers regarding product launches and important events related to Arcserve LLC; and other related business activities of which you are informed at the time your Personal Information is collected or as soon thereafter as practicable. Arcserve LLC only collects personally identifiable information about individuals when such individuals specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis or while requesting information on our products or services. We may disclose Personal Information to our agents, resellers and business partners or to protect and defend the rights or property of Arcserve LLC. Arcserve LLC must reply to lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, for disclosure of Personal Information.
Arcserve LLC does not sell, lease, or rent Personal Information to third parties.

Employee Information
We collect Employee Information from prospective and present Employees only for legitimate business purposes, including:
(1) the management and operations of our company, its functions and activities,
(2) Employee communications, including Employee surveys,
(3) maintaining a global directory,
(4) carrying out obligations under employment contracts and employment, tax and benefits laws, and in connection with other working relationships or arrangements,
(5) development and training programs,
(6) recruiting and hiring job applicants,
(7) assessing qualifications and performance,
(8) performing background checks and verifying references where applicable,
(9) managing Employee performance,
(10) determining Employee compensation or payment,
(11) managing the Employee termination process, and
(12) other general human resources purposes.
Our European Union Employees at the time of their employment are notified in detail how their Personal Information will be used. Employee information on health, performance evaluations and disciplinary actions and other sensitive Employee matters, whether it is stored manually or electronically, is accessible by other Arcserve LLC Employees only if necessary with respect to legitimate human resource functions or issues. Arcserve LLC will obtain affirmative consent from an Employee before using such Employee’s Personal Information for any purpose other than described above. Employees may decline to provide this consent and may withdraw their consent at any time.
For legitimate human resources purposes, Employees may choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information about family members. If our Employees choose to do this, their family member’s Personal Information shall be treated, for the purposes of this Policy, the same as an Employee’s Personal Information. Employee Personal Information is never sold, leased or rented to any third party. Employee Personal Information will never be disclosed to third parties except as follows:
(1) to those retained by Arcserve LLC as agents for the purposes set forth in the paragraph above,
(2) where required pursuant to an applicable law, government or judicial order, law or regulation, or to protect the rights or property of Arcserve LLC,
(3) where authorised in writing by the Employee, and
(4) where the Employee voluntarily provides Personal Information and the context makes it clear such information will be provided to a third party.
Where personal data is transferred from the EU to the US in the context of the employment relationship, we will cooperate in investigations by and to comply with the advice of the competent EU Authorities.
Data Centers
Arcserve will cooperate with its Data Center Customers to ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
If individuals whose Personal Data is stored at Arcserve’s Data Centers require access to, or want to limit the use and disclosure of, their Personal Data, those individuals should contact the Customer at the address provided by the Customer in its Notice at the time the Personal Data was collected by the Customer. Arcserve will cooperate with the Customer to provide access to individuals whose Personal Data is stored at Arcserve’s Data Centers in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
Arcserve’s employees do not have access to Personal Data stored at Data Centers owned by Arcserve, except incidental access if the Customer requests technical assistance based on the services purchased from Arcserve. Arcserve will comply with a request to provide access to its Data Centers that host information systems that store Personal Data only in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements, in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
Arcserve does not transfer or disclose Personal Data stored in information systems at its Data Centers unless it is directed to do so by the Customer. The Customer will be responsible for complying with the Accountability for Onward Transfers Principles for any transfer of Personal Data initiated by the Customer.
Choice
We will always give you an opportunity to choose opt-out before your Personal Information is (1) disclosed to a third party (other than a Arcserve LLC agent doing work at our direction), or (2) to be used for a purpose that is materially different than that for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorised by you. Although we do not ever anticipate providing sensitive Personal Information, such as Employee health information, to a non-agent third party or using it for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will never do so without first allowing the individual involved to affirmatively and expressly consent (opt-in) to such transfer or use. The only exception to this choice for both sensitive and non-sensitive Personal Information would be where we are required to disclose your Personal Information pursuant to government or judicial order, law or regulation to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
At a minimum, you will always be able to opt-out from receiving marketing materials from Arcserve LLC. If we determine that applicable national law requires that more stringent requirements (opt-in) be applied before you receive marketing material or other communications from us, we will implement the same.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
We will not transfer Personal Information originating in the EU to third parties unless such third parties have entered into an agreement in writing with us requiring them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection to your Personal Information as required by the Principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. We will only transfer data to our agents, resellers or third party service providers (such as accountants, attorneys, consultants and other service providers) who need the information in order to provide services or to perform activities on behalf of Arcserve LLC, including in connection with the delivery of services or products, Arcserve’s management, or legal responsibilities. We acknowledge our liability for such data transfers to third parties.
To protect Personal Information collected and stored by Arcserve LLC, we have in place reasonable and appropriate technical and operational security measures to prevent Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
We will only collect and retain Personal Information which is relevant to the purposes for which the information is collected, and we will not use it in a way that is incompatible with such purposes unless such use has been subsequently authorised by you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. We may occasionally contact you to determine that your data is still accurate and current.
Access
You have the right to access personal data relating to you. If you wish to access, amend, or confirm that Arcserve LLC has personal data relating to you, or if you wish to correct or delete your Personal Information if it is inaccurate, please notify us at brett.rizk@arcserve.com or at (952) 903-5555. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.
Employees may review their personal files and any Personal Information concerning them upon by emailing brett.rizk@arcserve.com.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Since we are committed to protecting your privacy as set forth in this Policy, if you think we are not in compliance with our Policy, or if you have any question or if you wish to take any other action concerning this Policy or your Personal Information, we encourage you to contact us at brett.rizk@arcserve.com or call us at (952) 903-5555. We will investigate your complaint, take appropriate action and report back to you within 45 days.
If the Personal Information in question was transferred from the EU to the United States, and you are not satisfied with our response, Arcserve LLC has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) to resolve disputes pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles. A resident of the European Union (EU) whose enquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed may contact the EU DPAs panel or individual EU DPAs using the information provided at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/third-countries/index_en.htm to resolve disputes pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles.
Arcserve LLC commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.
Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.
The services of the EU DPAs panel are provided at no cost to you.
