Archello Privacy Policy | Archello
The protection of your privacy and personal information is of the utmost importance to Archello. This Archello Privacy Policy gives transparency to the information we collect, how we use it and the steps we take to protect it. The policy governs all the products and services we provide throughout the website. When you use the site, you consent to the way we collect, manage and protect your data as described in this document.
1 Information you share with us
1.1 Your user account
When you sign up for a personal account at Archello we save your name, email and password. Passwords are saved encrypted. If you forget your email you can reset your password via a link that can be sent to the email address with which you created the account. In your personal account you are free to add your occupation, location, your interests, brands you want to follow and create a first collection during the sign-up phase. There is an option to skip all this. Archello can use this anonymized information to give clients insight into the demographics of its users and can use this anonymized information to offer you content linked to your interests, followed companies, profession and collections.
You are also free to add your gender and birthdate. Archello will never share this with other parties. As an option, you can add a profile picture and cover photo to your personal account and add a short description. When you login via facebook or linkedin, Archello automatically adds your profile image from the respective social media profile. The profile picture is visible if you link your personal account to a brand account as a team member, then your profile images and name will be shown in the team member section of the brand you connected to. The personal profile page is visible to the public, but you can turn this off in your settings by making your profile private.
1.2 Collection
When you make a collection your profile picture will be shown on the collection page and next to the collection card on the homepage if it is featured. When you save your favourite products or projects in a collection, you can choose to make this private or public. Visitors will only be able to see a public collection.
1.3 Newsletters
Archello offers newsletters. This way you can receive updates on the most interesting posts of the week or get notifications about new products or projects from your favorite companies, about upcoming events, new functions and offers. To make sure you only get newsletters that you wish to receive, you must explicitly opt-in. Our newsletters are sent via Sendgrid, Inc. (US), which receives the required information from us.
1.4 Request and contact forms
On a product page you can send a variety of requests about the product itself or the brand of the product. You can ask a product brand for more information, request prices, documentation, or request available suppliers. On a brand page you can contact a brand via the contact button. In order to respond to your request, the brand requires some of your information. The personal information you provide in the form will be shared with the contacted party. When you are logged into your personal account, automatically your name and email will be placed in the form. You can choose whether to make a request or not.
1.5 Follow
Every company on Archello has a follow button on their brand page. You can click on the follow button to get updates from a brand you are interested in. When a brand you are following adds a new project, product or article, you will receive an email notification from Archello about this new publication. In your sign-up you need to explicitly opt-in for these emails. In your account settings you can choose to turn this off or on. On the brand page of the company you follow, your name and profile picture are visible on their followers page.
1.6 Personal profile visibility
An open profile is visible for the public and indexed by search engines. This profile contains your name and added profile information (see 1.1), the collections you created and it shows the brands you are following. On the followers page of the brands you follow, your name and profile picture will also be visible. Brands you are connected to or created will also show your profile photo and name.
In the case you do not want your profile to be visible, you can use the setting 'Hide my profile' in your personal profile settings. With this ‘Hide my profile’ setting your personal profile page will change into an anonymous page for the public.
1.7 Activity
With certain actions on Archello, a company will receive a record of the action if it relates to their profile. When you save a product or project to a collection, download a brochure, click on a website link, download an image, or use any of the contact buttons, the company related to the item on Archello will see your public profile name mentioned in an activity list next to the action you performed. Only your username and profile image are visible, nothing more will be shared (such as your email or other contact information).
If you don't want your name to be visible, also for this you can ‘Hide your profile’ in the personal profile settings and instead of your name in the activity list, it will say ‘anonymous’.
