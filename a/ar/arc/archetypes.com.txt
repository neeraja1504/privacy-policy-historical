This Privacy Policy describes how Archetypes LLC (“ Archetypes “, “ we “, or “ us “) collects, uses, stores, shares and protects your information in connection with the Archetypes website located at www.archetypes.com (the “ Site “), and the services and tools (including, but not limited to, mobile and other software applications) related to the Site (collectively, the “ Service “). This Privacy Policy applies when you access, visit or use the Service. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in the Archetypes Terms of Service located at www.archetypes/terms-conditions.
By creating an Archetypes account, or by otherwise accessing, visiting or using the Service, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described in this Privacy Policy and in the Archetypes Terms of Service.
We will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the amended terms on the Site at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you have provided us with your email address we will also notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending an email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes to the email address you most recently provided to us. We encourage you to keep the email address you provide to us current, and to promptly notify us of any changes to your email address, so that you may receive any notices we send to you regarding material changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new terms, you may terminate your account within the applicable thirty (30) day period by contacting us using the information in Section 14 below or by deleting your account through the account settings link on your profile page, and you will not be bound by the amended terms. Otherwise, the new terms will take effect after thirty (30) days.
Information Collected by Archetypes.
Information You Provide to Us. We may collect information that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Service when you (i) register as a user of the Service; (ii) make changes to your user profile information; or (iii) send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us through the Service. If you register for an Archetypes account directly through the Service, you will be required to provide your email address and create a password. You may also choose to provide additional information in connection with your Archetypes account, including your full name, birthday, your city, state and country of residence, your zip code, your gender and a profile picture. If you elect to make a purchase through the Service, you will need to provide payment information, including a payment card number, and related security code, expiration date, and cardholder name and billing and shipping addresses. We may also collect information about your purchases and associate it with your Archetypes account.
Information We Collect From Social Media Services. Users can log on the Service through third-party social media platforms (such as Facebook) (each, a “ Social Media Service “). If you log on to the Service through a Social Media Service, you give Archetypes permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable Social Media Service to share with Archetypes in accordance with your privacy settings with the applicable Social Media Service. This information (including without limitation, your name, photographs, geographic location, birthday and any status update or text that you provide) may be displayed on the Service while you are logged on to the Service. If you choose to log on to the Service through a Social Media Service, we are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of the applicable Social Media Service. We encourage you to review, and if necessary, adjust, your privacy settings with the applicable Social Media Service before logging in to the Service using the applicable Social Media Service. Information that Archetypes receives from Social Media Services is stored and use by Archetypes in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information You Share on the Service. Some portions of the Service allow you to submit comments, reviews, tags, ratings, pictures and other content, including by sharing content using the “Me” or “You” buttons. Depending on the privacy settings that you choose in connection with your Archetypes account, this content may be displayed on the Service and may be viewable by other users of the Service as well as to the public generally through public search engines. In addition, depending on your privacy settings, your birthday, location and Archtypes “friends” may be visible to other users of the Service as well as to the public generally through public search engines. Further, if you are connected with another user of the Service through a Social Media Service (for example, you are “friends” on Facebook), depending on the privacy settings you have selected for the applicable Social Media Service, you and your connections from the applicable Social Media Service will be able to see each other’s public Archetypes profiles, including name, profile picture and “archetype.” However, although you may be connected to someone through a Social Media Service, you will not be “followers” on the Service unless a separate “follow” request is sent through the Service.

Archetypes, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may automatically collect information about you when you use the Service. The information automatically collected about you may include, but is not limited to, device ID, device type, browser type and version, geo-location information, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Service, ad data, IP address and standard web log information.

Cookies and Web Beacons. Archetypes, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may use cookies, locally stored objects and web beacons to automatically collect information about your use of the Service. Cookies are small bits of information that are transferred to and stored in separate files within your computer’s browser. The Service uses both “persistent cookies” which remain on your computer after you have closed your browser as well as “session cookies” which exist only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from your computer when you close your browser. Locally stored objects or “flash cookies” are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. You can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. You can also disable the storage of flash cookies.
