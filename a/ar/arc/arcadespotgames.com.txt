This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. We may maintain Aggregate Information or associate Aggregate Information with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. This information may include information about your computer and internet connection, including what browser you are using, your operating system and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

How We Collect and Use Information
We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as by sending us an email message or submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone or letter.
