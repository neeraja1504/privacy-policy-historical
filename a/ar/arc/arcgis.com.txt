The use of information collected through ArcGIS Online shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has Esri. Please read the entire Privacy Policy before providing any personally identifiable information to Esri.
Esri has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's TRUSTed Cloud Program Requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the ArcGIS Online service.

Service Provider Collection and Use
Esri collects personally identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, user name and password only if our Clients enter/upload this information voluntarily onto ArcGIS Online.  Esri collects information from its Clients, but has no direct relationship with the Client's customers whose personally identifiable information Esri processes on ArcGIS Online.
The voluntary information Esri collects is used to complete transactions; sign up for a trial account; ensure appropriate legal use of Esri services; provide notification to Clients about updates to Esri's and our affiliates' software, data, and services; respond to customer service requests and help provide technical support to our Clients. Esri may also use personally identifiable information to send marketing materials, User Conference information, and newsletters to our Clients.
Choice
Esri collects information from our Clients.If you are a customer of one of Esri's Clients, and would no longer like to be contacted by Esri or by one of our Clients that use our services, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. If you are a Client and would like to update your account please contact us at info@esri.com.
Access to Data Controlled by our Clients
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to Esri’s Client (the data controller). If the Client requests Esri to remove personally identifiable information from Esri computer systems, we  will respond to the Client's request within thirty (30) business days.
Data Retention
Esri may retain personally identifiable information that Esri processes on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Esri may retain and use this personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Security
The security of your personally identifiable information and our Clients’ information is important to Esri.  During the login process for ArcGIS Online when sensitive information (such as login credentials) is entered Esri encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  ArcGIS Online allows Esri Clients to choose an option to encrypt other data which is entered or uploaded to the service but no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, Esri cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact security@esri.com.
How Esri Shares Your Personally Identifiable Information
Esri will only share our Client's or Client's customers personally identifiable information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Business Transfer
In the event Esri goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, our Client's or Client's customers personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  Our Client's will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of the  personally identifiable information provided to Esri via ArcGIS Online.
