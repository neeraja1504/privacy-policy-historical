Your privacy is important to us. Game Gutter is free for all to use, and prior registration is not needed for use of Game Gutter
No information is sold or released to anyone about visitors to Game Gutter without prior consent or a court order. In other words, no information is released to anyone unless you give permission first.

When visiting any Internet site, your unique address called an "IP address" is recorded.

Game Gutter archives the log files in order to create aggregate statistical reports, detect errors at the web site, and for security reasons. The log files are eventually deleted.

This is done to verify billing for the ads. No additional information associated with any specific user is provided to the advertisers.
