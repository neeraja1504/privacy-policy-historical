"Non-personal information" is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as device and browser information, geographic and other information collected through server logs, cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information and other information provided by you and aggregated information. We and our service providers may collect non-personal information, such as demographic information (age, gender, etc.), employment and job preferences, taste or other preference information, and the like, when submitted to us, when you visit the Websites and directly or indirectly gathered from our communications with you.

All of this information is considered non-personal information because, unless combined with personal information, it does not personally identify you or any other visitor of the Websites.

We may also aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other visitor to the Websites, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our visitors who have a particular telephone area code.
