A.T.A. is obligated to process the Personal Data in accordance with these purposes and in compliance with the Applicable Laws.

(see Annex 1 ). The Data Subject has the right to withdraw a given consent at any time. The legitimate interests for which A.T.A. processes Personal Data are: national tourism policy, direct marketing, improving customer experience, offering newsletters, customer support, conducting research, promotional and cross-selling activities and identification. The IP addresses of Data Subjects recorded in the system may be used, in order to explore the cause of or solution to any problem arising in its servers, or to administer the Website.
4.2. Retention period
A.T.A. will not use and store Personal Data longer than necessary to fulfil the abovementioned purposes, and shall remove the collected Personal Data after the necessary period to achieve the purposes described in this Policy has passed, or to comply with contractual obligations or as permitted or required by the Applicable Laws. In Annex 1 you find the retention periods for Personal Data that A.T.A. processes and in Annex 3 you find the retention periods for the cookies used by A.T.A.
The Personal Data may only be processed to the extent necessary for the described purposes. Personal Data may in principle not be processed for other purposes other than that for which the Personal Data were collected. If there is a necessity or need to process Personal Data for other purposes, it shall be investigated by A.T.A. whether the purpose of the intended data processing is compatible with the original purpose. A.T.A. shall provide the Data Subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose.
A.T.A. handles Personal Data carefully and confidentially, and uses all suitable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Data.
A.T.A. follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to A.T.A., both during transmission and once A.T.A. receives it. Be advised, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while A.T.A. strives to use all commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data as much as possible, A.T.A. cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you choose to contact A.T.A. through Aruba.com, Arubaconventionbureau.com, Media.aruba.com, Arubainsight.com or the Aruba.com forum (collectively: “ the Website ”), you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically might not be secure. Apart from the legal obligations under the Applicable Laws, A.T.A. assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to A.T.A. electronically. In communicating with you, A.T.A. may send e-mail in an unencrypted form because A.T.A. is aware that most persons cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.
Personal Data is being accessed or transferred by A.T.A. and other third parties such as service providers, agencies (hired by the A.T.A.), business partners, A.T.A. representatives, eCRM & Data base agency, website developer/ management agency, customer support agencies, social media, data analytics, companies that personalize the Website, digital registration tools (Customer support registration tool), Website analytics agency, companies that make customer service accessible via social media. These third parties are listed in Annex 4 of this Policy.
A.T.A. further discloses Personal Data in case such disclosure is mandatory under Applicable Laws or is reasonably judged to be essential in order to protect and safeguard the rights, property and safety of other parties, A.T.A. itself, and/or A.T.A.'s affiliates. In certain circumstances, it is possible that Personal Data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
ATA may transfer Personal Data to a third country or international organisations outside of the European union/European Economic Area (“ EU/EEA ”), which shall take place only in compliance with the Applicable Laws, and where appropriate safeguards are in place that ensure the level of protection of Data Subjects as required by the Applicable Laws (e.g. transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision or standard EU Model clauses).
With respect to storage, A.T.A. uses various applications for obtaining and storing certain data. To guarantee your privacy, these applications are subject to strict regulations. Most data and the Website is stored within the European Union. In respect of data that is forwarded to non-EU countries, A.T.A. only uses companies that provide sufficient protection in line with European legislation (e.g. a ‘Privacy Shield’ certification or signing the EU Model Clauses). For the purposes of forwarding data to other countries and parties, A.T.A. enters into Data Processing Agreements with EU Model Clauses attached. If you wish to see such a contract, feel free to contact: dpo@aruba.com.
