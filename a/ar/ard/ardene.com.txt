Disclosure of Personal Information
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share or transfer your Personal Information to third parties. However, aggregate information may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other purposes.
We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, better understanding our Site visitors or otherwise provide services to Site visitors, including performing such functions as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These third-party service providers are not permitted to use the Personal Information except for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
When we use third-party service providers, contractual provisions and other safeguards are used to ensure compliance by such third-party service providers with this Privacy Policy and all applicable privacy laws. Contractual provisions and other safeguards are also used to ensure that, where your Personal Information is transferred, processed or stored outside Canada, it is given protection similar to the protection set forth in this Privacy Policy. You agree that persons or entities outside of Canada to which Personal Information is transferred may be required to disclose your Personal Information to governmental authorities, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies, pursuant to the laws of their jurisdiction.
We may disclose Personal Information when we believe release is required to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ardene or others.
Ardene will remain responsible at all times for Personal Information under its control.
Protecting personal information
Ardene protects Personal Information by implementing a variety of security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, including through the use of the following measures: physical security measures, such as appropriate disposal of Personal Information; electronic security measures, such as password protection and firewalls; and organizational processes such as limiting access to Personal Information to a selected group of persons on a “need to know” basis. ** **
No verbal or written disclosure of Personal Information or transmission of data containing Personal Information over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties to overhear, see, intercept or access private communications or transmissions unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, Ardene cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us in person or over the internet. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.
