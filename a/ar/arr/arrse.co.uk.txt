Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining our data collection practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Personal Security
Many users have concerns about their personal security above and beyond most internet users. To fully address security concerns, there is a detailed article about security and privacy here in the Army Rumour Service wiki.
Cookies
When you visit our community website, www.arrse.co.uk or www.navy-net.co.uk, we send one or more cookies to your web browser. A cookie is a small, harmless piece of information that is stored in your browser. Only the domain which set that cookie can access the information from it. (ie, other domains can’t access cookies set by us and we can’t access cookies set by others) The table below explains the cookies we use and why.

Third party advertising cookies
Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don’t have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website). If you would like to disable “third party” cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party’s website and getting them to generate a one-time “no thanks” cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine. Here are links to the two main third party advertising platforms we use, each of which has instructions on how to do this: Google Doubleclick Advertising Privacy http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy-policy/ You can also visit the trade body representing advertising companies for more information on how to opt out of these cookies Finally you can directly control cookies in your browser by following this guide.
Other Partners
We also work in partnership with Quantcast, using their Measure product. This allows us to gather statistics about our user base (anonymous, overview type information) which we can use to give information about us to potential advertisers.  For more information please see the Quantcast privacy policy.
Information we Collect
Server Logs
Whenever your access a file from our website, the server logs the following data: (i) Requested File name, (ii) Your IP address, (iii) Date & Time of request, (iv) Your user agent, (v) Referring webpage (if any), and (vi) Size of the requested document.
Forum Account
In the process of creating an account on the Army Rumour Service, we ask for your EMail address. This is done to verify your identity & that you are a real human being; and not some unscrupulous bot submitting web forms across the internet. Also, each thread, post, message you create on the Forum is associated with your Forum account & stamped with your I.P. address.
Visitor Patterns
We use a visitor tracking and analysis service (Google Analytics) to see how our website, website sections and webpages are performing. (e.g. Unique Visitors, Page Views, Total Visitors, etc.). No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.
Outbound Clicks
We track outbound clicks from our webpages too. Again, No personally identifiable information is collected in the process. Only pure statistical information like the URI of clicked link and URI of the page from which the click was done, is stored. Further info and the ability to opt-out from VisualDNA cookies can be found here and selecting ‘ad choices’.
How we Use It
E-Mail Addresses
EMail addresses you entered while registering on the Forum and/or while commenting on Blog posts are used to provide you updates of any content which you have subscribed to. Occasionally (once in a month or two), we send out newsletters and/or important announcements regarding the changes in website, ongoing contests, maintenance downtimes, etc. You Email addresses are safe with us. We won’t sell it to anyone! Our newsletters may contain advertising as secondary content, but will never be just advertising mail shots.
Other Voluntary Profile Information
We make no use at all of voluntary profile information that you may add to your user account (eg. location, website).
Passwords
The password which you use to login to the Forum account is salted and then encrypted before being saved in our database. It’s NEVER stored in a plaintext format. This way even we can’t see what your password is. And that’s why in case you forget your login password, we can’t retrieve it for you; we are only able to change it to something else.
Visitor Statistics
Visitor statistics and data logged by the server and Google Analytics are used to improve our site. We can quickly see which pages are performing well and which of them are not. Some statistics like Total Visitors, Unique Visitors, Aggregate PageViews per month are released to public. But no personal information is ever revealed.
Cookies
Cookies are used to store your personal preferences for a short time. They are used to customise the content that is served to you on the Forum (primarily) and/or other site’s sections. Cookies are also used to store your site login credentials. (So you may or may not face difficulties accessing member-only functions, if you login with cookies disabled in your browser)
Data Security
Appropriate measures (user authentication, authorization, data encryption) are taken to ensure that the data we collect is safeguarded and secure from unauthorized access. Regarding the data submitted in Forum: private profile fields can only be accessed by site administrators, and I.P. addresses attached to the threads/posts can only be accessed by site administrators and moderators.
Use by children
Protecting very young children’s privacy is quite important. For that very reason we currently don’t allow account registrations by children under 13 years of age, on our Forum.
Accessing your Info

In the case of Forums, you can edit your personal information and site preferences via your profile and section (click on your username in the top right of the page when logged in). There are various areas within settings to add and edit data. These are the most relevant to your privacy: Personal Details Edit your personal information like birth date, birth date visibility preference, website URI, instant messaging (IM) contacts, your Location, Occupation, Hobbies / Topics of Interest, Biography, etc. All of these fields are optional and you can clear them out anytime you want.
