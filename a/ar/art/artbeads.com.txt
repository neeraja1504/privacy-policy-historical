Use of Cookies
The Artbeads website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Artbeads pages, or register with Artbeads site or services, a cookie helps Artbeads to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Artbeads website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Artbeads features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Artbeads services or websites you visit.

These companies may employ cookies, single pixel gifs or web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness. They may also use this technology to serve specialized or relevant advertising content and/or recommendations to you on our site or on a third party's website. Note that any information that these third parties collect via any tracking method is completely anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. If you would like to learn more about network advertisers, including how to opt-out of individual company's ads, please click here.
Artbeads may also engage third party service providers to provide additional functionality on our website. These third parties may collect and/or store data elements for use in providing their services, including, but not limited to, your social media identifier, IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. These data elements will be used solely for the purposes of providing their services and will not be shared with other companies or used for any other purpose.
