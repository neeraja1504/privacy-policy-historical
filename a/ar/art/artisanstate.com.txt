Using Technical Information
We will use your non-personally-identifiable technical information to improve the usability of our websites, mobile sites, and mobile applications.
Collecting Content Information
Any image uploaded to our server will be automatically collected and saved until deleted by the user who uploaded the image. Any project created will be automatically collected and saved until deleted by the user who created the project. If a project has been ordered it can no longer be deleted.
Using Content Information
On our websites and mobile sites at the end of checkout on the confirmation page a user will be given the voluntary option to authorize Artisan State to share the images contained in that order on Artisan State’s social media. Authorization allows Artisan State to share one or all images from that order at any time in the future and to alter the size of images to fit social media. Artisan State is not responsible for users who accidentally authorize images to be shared. Artisan State is not responsible for water marking images before sharing. Artisan State is not responsible for incorrectly attributing images. Artisan State is not responsible for other social media users who download or share images that are featured in Artisan State’s social media without owners permission. Artisan State will attempt to delete images from social media after posting if subsequently requested by owner, but if images cannot be found or deleted Artisan State is not responsible.
If the owner of a project shares their project using the “share url” or “embed code” we are not responsible for where the project is distributed.
Artisan State reserves the right to delete any images that you upload if Artisan State determines that your images are inappropriate for any reason, scenarios may include copyrighted or pornographic images. We are not responsible for providing copies of these deleted images.

You must be at least 13 years or older to register and use Artisan State. If you are under 13, you must use an account created by a parent of guardian, and you must have the explicit permission of a parent of guardian to use Artisan State.
Security
We use a secure server, which encrypts our sign-in page, sign-up page and all payment data. For extra security we do not store your credit card information in our database unless you are purchasing a membership plan with a recurring monthly fee.
