This information is primarily used for our own purposes; however, we reserve the right to share our customer lists with approved companies. This means that you may receive marketing materials from companies that have products you may be interested in. Your e-mail address will not be shared with other companies in any event ; however, Artbeats may use e-mail to send you information from us and possibly other companies', including special offers, newsletters, and press releases.

As a standard practice, Artbeats assigns a unique number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. This number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie."

We analyze this data for trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there, and what items visitors are searching for. We use all this information in order to improve our content, plan future products and measure overall site effectiveness.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be able to access certain pages.)
Sharing Information
Artbeats discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 25% of our users are interested in Sports footage, etc) in order to describe our services to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. We don't tell other companies specific information about any of our users.
