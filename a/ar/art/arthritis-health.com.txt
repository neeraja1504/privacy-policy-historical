What information we collect

Personal data means information that directly identifies you (such as your name, address, or email address) or data that could be used to indirectly identify you (such an IP address or browser agents). You can browse our Websites without submitting your personal data to us. However, there are circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal data, including when you subscribe to our newsletters, and other content; complete a survey, participate in market research, upload content in our online forums or on social media; or when you seek employment at Veritas Health. The ways that Veritas Health collects information from you are described below.
How we collect information
Veritas Health collects personal data in the following ways:
Registration
Access to some of our services, such as online forums on our Websites, may be limited to users who have registered an account with us. When you sign up for an account, we collect the personal data you submit to us through the registration process. Some of our tools do not retain your personal data, while others store your personal data in accordance with this Policy.

Any information (including personal data) you share in any online community, including forums or online discussions, is open to the public. You should always consider your online environment before posting any personal data in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. Your post may potentially show up in third-party search engines.
If you choose to use the forums and add personally identifying information (including personal medical information) to Veritas Health Forum discussions you understand the information (including personal data) shared is open to the public. You understand this is an online environment and acknowledge the risks of posting any personal data in this public forum. You understand that Veritas Health cannot control or predict outside misuse of the information you post and is not responsible for third party use of the information you choose to share.

In general, Veritas Health does not share personal data about you with third parties for their own direct marketing or advertising purposes unless you request or consent to such sharing, or as otherwise described below. However, we do share personal data with third parties for the following limited purposes.
Disclosures to Veritas Health Contractors
Veritas Health contractors sometimes have limited access to your personal data in the course of providing products or services to Veritas Health. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising, marketing assistance, and/or content in connection with our operation and maintenance of the Websites. We contractually require that our contractors:
Protect the privacy of your personal data consistent with this Policy, and
Not use or disclose your personal data for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for Veritas Health.

Veritas Health collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate visitors’ activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites. We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers, but Veritas Health will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When Veritas Health does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you.
In addition, Veritas Health does not provide third-party access to your personal data except in the aggregate and only after the information has been anonymized and/or without your express permission. The information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior.
Our advertising partners’ ad server may use cookies when you view pages on our site. These cookies collect anonymous information as a way of measuring the effectiveness of advertising sold on Veritas Health.

If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere.

How we protect your information
Veritas Health uses reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal data under our control and appropriately limit access to it. We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. We anonymize data by removing and replacing personal data with an empty string or blank spaces prior to the form being saved on our servers. Our Websites use encryption technology to protect your personal data you submit via our Websites and during data transport. That being said, Veritas Health cannot guarantee or warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data that you may provide. However, electronic transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.
How long we keep your information
We will retain your personal data as long as your account is active and/or it is needed to provide you services. At any time, you can remove your personal data or instruct us to remove it.
