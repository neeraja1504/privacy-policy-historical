Disclosure and Privacy Policy
Effective May 29, 2018
Hi. I’m Jean Van’t Hul, the owner of The Artful Parent. I understand that your privacy is of critical importance. This Privacy Policy describes what information is collected from you at The Artful Parent and how that information is used and disclosed.
Who we are
The Artful Parent website address is: https://artfulparent.com
Disclosure Statement
The Artful Parent blog is owned by Artful Media LLC.
The Artful Parent blog accepts forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, paid insertions or other forms of compensation.
The compensation received may occasionally influence the content selected to publish and the timing of that post. That content, advertising space or post will be identified as such within the guidelines of the FTC disclosure rules.
The views and opinions expressed on The Artful Parent are purely those of me, Jean Van’t Hul, chief blogger and children’s art enabler. Even though The Artful Parent blog receives compensation for some posts and advertisements, I always give my honest opinion, findings, beliefs, and experiences on those topics or products. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.
I only work with companies and organizations I believe in and share products that I love and think that you will love, too.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail The Artful Parent team at hello@artfulparent.com
