Your Responsibilities under EU Law (EDPR Compliance)
When selling on the ArtFire platform you may obtain and determine what to do with European Union users personal information. This information may be given to you when communicating with users and transactions with buyers. This means you process their personal information (i.e. buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other EU users that you may have obtained through the ArtFire services.
You are responsible for protecting user personal information you receive or process and comply with all relevant legal requirements when you use the ArtFire Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways you can use a user’s information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to ArtFire users you interact with and compatible with this policy and ArtFire’s Terms of Use.
For more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more resources at https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie.
As a data controller, to the extent that you process user personal information outside of the ArtFire, you may be required under applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor requests for data access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to processing. Also, if you disclose personal information without the buyer’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. This includes, for example, disclosures you make or unintentional data breaches. For example, you may receive a buyer’s email address or other information as a result of entering into a transaction with that buyer. This information may only be used for ArtFire-related communications or for ArtFire-facilitated transactions. You may not use this information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions. Without the buyer’s consent, and subject to other applicable ArtFire policies and laws, you may not add any ArtFire member to your email or physical mailing list, use that buyer’s identity for marketing, or obtain or retain any payment information. Please keep in mind that you're responsible for knowing the standard of consent required in any given instance.
If ArtFire and you are found to be joint data controllers of personal information, and if ArtFire is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify ArtFire for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal information.
