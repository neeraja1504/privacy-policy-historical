Your ArticleStars Directory Privacy Policy
ArticleStars.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We
may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street
address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will
never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.
Period.
How we gather information from users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access
to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate
in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other
interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, ArticleStars.com also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold
information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user
name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse
to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of
the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may
not be able to customize the sites features according to your preferences.
What we do with the information we collect
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and
do not share your information with anyone.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
www.ArticleStars.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by www.ArticleStars.com and other topics we think you might
find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticleStars.com may also
be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of
sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third
parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web
hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your
information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we
continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other
companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among
the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a
court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so
by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements
ArticleStars.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through
our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a

hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticleStars.com you may be introduced to,

offered by other parties. ArticleStars.com is not responsible for the actions or
policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of
those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a
third party.
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may
use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences
or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served
by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use
cookies or other technology to gather information. ArticleStars.com does not
control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and
is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
Such activities are beyond the control of ArticleStars and this policy.
