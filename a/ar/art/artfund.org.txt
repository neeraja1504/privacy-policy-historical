Privacy and cookies - Art Fund
1. Introduction and communication
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. We will only contact you regarding projects you may be interested in; moreover, we do not sell or share your details with other parties who may send you unsolicited emails or letters/communications. Art Fund will use your contact details to send you communications from time to time about inspiration for your next art visit; National Art Pass members will also receive information on how to make the most of the National Art Pass. We also contact you in order to promote the exhibition programmes of the organisations we work with and how you can make a difference by helping us with major appeals to support museums and galleries across the UK. For example, we use the address provided by those who have a National Art Pass to send them copies of our magazine Art Quarterly, and we use the email address, with your consent, for our fortnightly e-newsletter 'Art in your inbox', which contains ideas for great days out, must-see exhibitions and the latest Art Fund news.
If you prefer not to receive certain types of letters or emails from us, we will respect your wishes.
We may, only on very specific occasions and always with your permission to do so, share your details with museums and galleries or relevant partners, for example if a person has donated towards a specific appeal to buy an important work of art for a museum, we will ask at the time of the donation if they will be happy for the museum to get in touch. We also work with a number of trusted suppliers to deliver our goods and services. Please see Section 7. Who we share your personal information with for more information.

6. How we protect your information and how long we keep it for
We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal data so as to guard against loss, damage and unauthorised access by third parties.

For example we use encryption for logging in to your online account and for all financial information you provide to us.
We will only hold your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and to fulfil our legal obligations. The retention periods will vary depending on the purpose, for example if you make a card payment we will only hold your card details while the payment is being processed.

More about how we protect your information ____
We view our responsibility to safeguard your data with the utmost seriousness, and we take appropriate steps to protect you. Nevertheless cybercrime and data theft are increasingly prevalent and as such the Internet is not (and mobile devices are not) a 100% secure medium. We cannot therefore guarantee the security of information disclosed to us and want to make you aware of some particular risks when using internet and mobile devices.
Some links on our website may take you to third party sites, over which we have no control. When linking to another website we encourage you to read the privacy policy stated on that website.
Phishing is a cybercrime in which an individual is targeted and contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data. If you have concerns about any communication that might seem to be a genuine Art Fund communication, please review our helpful explanation on phishing before reacting.
Art Fund does not transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area. In the unlikely event that this needs to happen in the future, we will make you aware and put the required safeguards in place to ensure the security of your data.
7. Who we share your personal information with
We use a number of trusted data processors in order to deliver our goods and services. This includes Supporter Services who can assist you with enquiries six days a week, and our mailing house who may, for example, send you your Art Quarterly magazine, and our professional advisers.
In some instances we will share your data with your consent, for example you may ask us to share your information with a museum whose Art Happens project you have supported. In other instances, such as when you have applied for funding, we may share your details with specialist advisors with whom we work to ensure that we spend our charitable resources responsibly.
All third parties we work with are very carefully selected and are bound by data-sharing agreements to ensure that they treat your data with the same care and respect as Art Fund.
More about who we share your personal information with ____
your personal data may be shared with our employees, volunteers and/or third party organisations that we appoint to assist Art Fund. We will only share the personal information necessary for the purposes in question and we shall endeavour to ensure that any such recipients of your personal data use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data
where appropriate measures have been taken to minimise the extent of the personal data in question, this data may be provided to third parties to process lawfully:
in relation to any fundraising campaigns, competitions and promotions that we run jointly with a third party
in circumstances in which we are required or authorised by regulatory or governmental authorities requesting disclosure of your personal data, for example in the case of court orders
From time to time, we may allow a third party to sponsor a promotion, offer, competition [or] page of the website [or one of our mobile applications (or a part of one)].
