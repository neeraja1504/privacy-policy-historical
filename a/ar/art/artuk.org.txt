4. Disclosure of your information
4.1 In order to provide our products and services, we may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
4.2 Where we have your opt-in consent to do so, we may share your information with selected third parties who we work with in order to run and promote our projects, including but not limited to, the BBC, and participating collection administrations.
4.3 We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:
(a) if the Public Catalogue Foundation or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party (who will be a UK charity and a not-for-profit organisation), in which case personal data will be one of the transferred assets and the new owner may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice;
(b) if required to do so by Law or in we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by any order of the Courts or other competent body or agency;

We shall only use processors that will commit to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure that their processing activities meet the requirements of Data Privacy Laws and ensure the protection of your data protection rights. Prior to allowing these service providers to access your personal data, we will enter into a formal agreement with them to ensure that they handle and process the information in accordance with applicable law.
4.4 We will not share your information with parties outside of the European Economic Area (the EEA ) unless we are legally permitted or required to do so. You should be aware that certain non-EEA countries do not require the same standards of protection of personal data as are legally required in the EEA. If we send your data to these countries, we will ensure that there are appropriate and suitable safeguards to protect your personal data. This will involve at least one of the following:
(a) we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and
(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
If you require further information on these mechanisms, please contact us at info@artuk.org.

5.1 All information you provide to us is stored within the EEA on secure servers provided by a third party vendor. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to our Website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we will limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to access your data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
5.2 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
5.3 The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.
