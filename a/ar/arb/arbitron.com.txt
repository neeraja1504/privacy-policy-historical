ARBITRON'S SUBSCRIBERS/CLIENTS
Arbitron collects personally identifiable information, or personal information, such as name, organization, address, business and personal e-mail addresses, and telephone number, when our clients provide this information at the time of registration.

In some instances, we may use other companies to perform certain services on our behalf. These companies may need access to personal information to complete the services. The companies will not have authorization to use personally-identifiable information for purposes other than to perform the services on our behalf. The data we collect are considered our proprietary business assets and may be transferred if Arbitron or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another company. We may also be required by law to release personally-identifiable information under certain circumstances.
