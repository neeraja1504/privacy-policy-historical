Children
The Arbor Day Foundation has a long-standing commitment to helping children learn about the planting and care of trees. Honoring that commitment, this site will continue to present reliable information to young people as well as adults. This information will be presented in a proper and educational context, and will at no time include references or images that would be inappropriate for children at home or in a classroom setting.
Shipping
All trees delivered as part of our membership packages are shipped for free. Shipping costs for our nursery trees are $9.95 for any order under $60. Orders over $60 are shipped for free.
Trees are shipped at the right time for planting where you live. Credit cards are charged no more than 30 days prior to shipment.
Guarantee
When you order trees from The Arbor Day Foundation, your order is guaranteed to arrive in a good, healthy condition or we’ll replace them at no charge. Your trees will be shipped at a suitable time for planting. Each tree and plant is guaranteed to grow, or we’ll replace it within one year of shipment.
Refunds
All refunds will be provided as a credit to the credit card used at the time of purchase within 7–10 business days, upon receipt of the returned merchandise.
Nursery trees: Free replacement or 100% refund is issued if trees arrive in poor condition or if trees do not survive within one year of planting. After one year, 1/2 price replacement is offered (original price plus S&H.)
Membership Trees: Free replacement or 100% refund is issued if trees arrive in poor condition or trees do not survive within one year of planting. After one year or if multiple replacements have been requested on the same package, then we ask for $5.00 to cover shipping & handling.
Non-Tree Items: Please contact us with 30 days to setup a refund or replacement.
