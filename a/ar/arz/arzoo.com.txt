From time to time, we may disclose your Personal Information as follows:
To those travel service providers with which you make arrangements through our Site, for example, airlines, car rental, hotel, ground transportation, theater, attraction, or travel insurance. We provide them with the Personal Information needed to make and complete the purchase, booking or reservation.
To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of Arzoo, for example to provide customer service, deliver tickets, ship items, process credit cards, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Site, to facilitate usage by a Visitor, or to offer credit card services or evaluate your creditworthiness. We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in other countries. Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to Arzoo, and under the instructions of Arzoo, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy.

How we retain and store Personal information
We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our document management, retention and destruction policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for the trip you purchased but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it. Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations, and on servers controlled by Arzoo, located either at our offices, or at the offices of our service providers, as described in 'How we protect Personal Information'.
How we protect Personal Information
Arzoo employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to contact Arzoo through the Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Arzoo assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking, reservation or purchase on the Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction. In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests, or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted email.
Changes to the Privacy Policy and Changes in Ownership
We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also undergo a change of ownership. We will post an appropriate notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and changes of ownership on our Site. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the Site, as well as to the existing information held by us. If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your Personal Information (and/or that of other individuals for whom you made travel reservations or who have received your Alerts) from our records.
Disputes
If any dispute arises between you and Arzoo during your use of the Site or thereafter, in connection with the validity, interpretation, implementation or alleged breach of any provision of the Terms and Conditions, the dispute shall be referred to a sole Arbitrator who shall be an independent and neutral third party identified by Arzoo. The place of arbitration shall be Mumbai. The arbitration proceedings shall be in the English language. The Terms and Conditions shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India.
