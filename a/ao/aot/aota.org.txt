Privacy Policy - AOTA
Effective December 22, 2016
Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes AOTA’s practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the information we collect from and about you when you use any of AOTA’s websites and mobile applications (the “Service”). From time to time the number of websites that make up the Service may change. Each website that makes up the Service will provide a link to this unifying privacy policy. As such, this policy will govern the privacy practices of each website that links to this policy.
AOTA respects the privacy of its members and website visitors. We aim to give our website visitors the opportunity to know what information we collect about them, why we collect that information, how we use that information to improve their experience, and how they can limit the use of that personally identifiable information (PII) beyond the purposes for which they first provided it.
By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
Policy Changes
Whenever we change our policy, we will post those changes on this page. We will also announce these changes on the AOTA.org website. Since these policy change notices last only a limited time, you should periodically check this privacy policy to review any possible changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

This information helps AOTA improve the efficiency, security, and relevance of the Service.

When using the Service on a mobile device, AOTA collects specific device information contained in your “device identifier.” Such information includes the device type, operating system, and mobile network. We may associate this identifier with your account to customize the Service to your devices/account.
Location Information
Likewise, use of the Service on a mobile device may result in collection of the location of the device. This information may also be associated with your account. You can disable this on your particular device. However, be aware that some features of the Service may not function properly as a result.

If you create an account on the Service, at a minimum, we collect the following personal information:

We may use third party service providers to help us deliver, improve, protect, or promote the Service. We may use various third parties to deliver online coursework, deliver online publication content, send email messages and updates, analyze the security and operation of the Service, process payments, and other similar services. Using these third party service providers may also result in sharing and storing your personally identifiable information in locations and on servers, or clouds outside of the direct control of AOTA.
From time to time, these third party service providers may have access to your personally identifiable information for the limited purpose of providing the contracted service. ****

In order to comply with law or regulation; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect AOTA’s rights or property, and as AOTA deems appropriate in its sole discretion, we may also disclose your aggregated or personally identifiable information to government authorities, law enforcement authorities, or our legal counsel.
In an Aggregate and Non–Personally Identifiable Manner

AOTA does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an account on the Service.

Use of IP address
Every computer and device connected to the Internet is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are typically assigned in country-based blocks and can often be used to identify the country, state, and city from which a computer is connecting to the Internet. Because IP addresses need to be used by websites for the Internet to function, AOTA websites have access to your IP addresses.
Privacy Controls
You may modify certain preferences related to your account. Specifically, you can opt out of email newsletters, AOTA membership offers, AOTA products, AOTA events, AOTA advocacy efforts, information from third-party vendors, and surveys.
Data Integrity & Security
AOTA applies commercially reasonable and industry-standard technical, administrative, and organizational security measures to protect the integrity of the data we collect and to guard against unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of, or accidental destruction of such data.
Particularly, when you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) as part of our Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using industry-standard encryption.
Risks Inherent in Sharing Information
Although we take reasonable steps to maintain the security of our systems and the information associated with your account, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your Content, and we are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service.
Do Not Track Signals
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. We currently do not respond to “do not track” signals.
Links to Other Websites
The Service contains links to other websites not operated by AOTA. We are not responsible for the practices employed by such websites nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect and your activities on that third party website are subject to such third party website’s own rules and policies. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Service and to read the privacy policies of those websites.
