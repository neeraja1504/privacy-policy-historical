What Information Do We Collect?
Information You Provide – We collect information you provide, such as email addresses, telephone numbers, and payment information. Some of this information may be personally identifiable information, which means that it can be tied to a specific individual.
This information allows us to communicate with individuals in our community and to conduct online transactions.
Behavioral Data – We collect information about a specific user’s online browsing behaviors, such as what you search for, which pages you visit, what products and services you purchase, what links you click, and what articles you download, etc.
This data allows us to deliver more relevant offers and personalized content to each visitor based on inferences about their interests. We, our service providers and third party online companies such as ad networks and advertising partners may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites when you use our website. See the sections below discussing cookies and similar technologies for a description of these tools and how they are used.
Other Automatically Collected Information – We also collect other information that allows us to track the use of our web pages at an aggregate and de-identified level, to improve our overall web experience. We may use and share this de-identified data for any purpose at our discretion.
How Do We Collect Your Information?
User Provided Data
We ask you directly to provide your information when you register on our site, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, provide us with feedback on our products or services, attend an event, or enter information on our site.
Analytics Tracking Code
We use web analytics code to track information about your implicit web use patterns and online behaviors each time you visit our website, to better understand your needs and interests.
Cookies
We use small snippets of code to track your visits including both cookies and web beacons.
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
We use cookies to:
Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.
Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
Keep track of advertisements.
Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.
If you do not wish to be tracked, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to decline all cookies. You can do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie settings.
If you turn cookies off, some features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.
Web beacons
Web beacons, which are also known as clear GIFs, Web bugs or pixel tags, are often used in combination with cookies. They are images (often transparent) that are part of Web pages. At AACN, Web beacons allow us to count users who have visited certain pages and to generate statistics about how our site is used. They are not used to access personally identifiable information.
Unlike cookies, you cannot decline Web beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies or to prompt you for a response will keep Web beacons from tracking your activity.
Do Not Track
We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant advertising or analytics cookies, or use behavioral advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. For more information, see All About Do Not Track.

We may use the information we collect from you for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:
To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.
