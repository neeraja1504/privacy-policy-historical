AAT privacy policy | AAT
AAT carries a firm commitment to the privacy of your personal data.
This privacy policy describes the information we collect through this website (www.aat.org.uk), and:
What we do with it
Who we share parts of it with
The information we collect and how we use it.
We believe it is essential to respect the privacy of all visitors and to make safe and ethical use of the information provided to the website. We aim to give you as much control as possible over the information you give us, and in all cases the disclosure of your personal details is voluntary.
Where we ask for information we do so in order to offer you better services, both on the website and in the rest of our operations.
If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, you can update your details in your MyAAT account or contact us to update it.
Some of the information you give will be held in databases: we ensure that these are highly secure and can only be accessed by authorised people.
We will ask for your email address to:
Set up your MyAAT account
Update you with information and newsletters relevant to your studies and membership
Send you occasional invitations to participate in surveys to help us enhance and improve our service.
You can change your email address or choose not to receive further information at any time.
Who will have access to the information
Any information you give will be available to AAT. We will never share your email address with third parties except select parties we commission to undertake research on our behalf.
We will only allow trusted and relevant organisations to contact you, where we believe you will be interested in the information they can provide. Your contact details will not be provided directly to the third party organisation but to an independent mailing house who will then delete your details from their database as part of the Data Protection Act 1998. The information you’ll receive from third party organisations will be related to your AAT studies, CPD opportunities, career or study progression
Information you give in response to surveys and questionnaires on the website will be used in two ways:
By AAT itself to help determine policy and to help improve its services to members
By third parties that AAT may make the information available for market research - in this case, the information will be made available only in the form of anonymous qualitative and statistical reports.
We may follow up some survey responses by phone or email, but only where you have given your permission for us to do so as part of the initial research.
Booking AAT events
You can book to attend AAT events through a third party site which is managed by Eventsforce.
Eventsforce Solutions Ltd is registered with the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. The company, on behalf of its customers, takes all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that all personal data held on any of its systems – including the events management system “Eventsforce” – is kept secure against unauthorised access, loss or destruction.
AAT will have access to all the data shared by event attendees. No identifying information will ever be passed or sold to a third party.
The website www.aat.org.uk is a completely separate entity to Eventsforce booking platform. If you book on an AAT event, we will email you from the Eventsforce platform about your booking.
AAT Green Room
