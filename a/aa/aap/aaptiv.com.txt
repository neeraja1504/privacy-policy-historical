In order to provide our services, such as recommending classes you may enjoy, we may read and/or write data to the Apple HealthKit database on your Apple device with your consent. We will not use this information for marketing or advertising purposes or share it with third parties.
California Privacy Rights
Under California's "Shine the Light" law, we provide a method for consumers to "opt-out" of having their information shared with third-parties. Contact us at help@aaptiv.com to unsubscribe.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated websites or mobile applications. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time.
You may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program.  Note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.  It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.  In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
Children
Our Site, App, and services are not directed to children under 13. We will never knowingly collect any personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13. If Aaptiv obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted and will not be shared or disclosed to third parties.
Security
We maintain reasonable and appropriate measures designed to maintain information we collect in a secure manner.  We have taken certain physical, electronic, and administrative steps to safeguard and secure the information we collect from Site visitors and App users.  Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances.
