Individual rights regarding Personal Data
The data protection rights you have under the GDPR are summarized below, as follows:
Right to Access. You have the right to confirm whether AAPG processes your Personal Data and, where it does, access to the Personal Data, together with certain additional information, including details regarding the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned, and the recipients of the Personal Data. Provided the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, AAPG will supply to you a copy of your Personal Data. The first copy will be provided free of charge. Additional copies, however, may be subject to a reasonable fee.
Right to Rectification. You have the right to have any inaccurate Personal Data about you rectified and, considering the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete Personal Data about you completed.
Right to Erasure. In some circumstances, you have the right to the erasure of your Personal Data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the Personal Data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include, where processing is necessary: to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information; to comply with a legal obligation; or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
Right to Restrict Processing. In some circumstances, you have the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; AAPG no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of AAPG’s processing, but you require Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, AAPG may continue to store your Personal Data; however, AAPG will only otherwise process it: with your consent; to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
Right to Object to Processing. You have the right to object to AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary to: perform a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in AAPG; or to pursue AAPG’s legitimate interests or those of a third party. If you make such an objection, AAPG will cease to process the Personal Data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. You have the right to object to AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you so object, AAPG will cease to process your Personal Data for this purpose. You have the right to object to AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary to perform a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
Right to Data Portability. If the legal basis for AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data is:
Consent; or
The processing is necessary to perform or enter into a contract to which you are party,
and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data from AAPG in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This right does not apply, however, where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority. If you believe AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.
Right to Withdraw Consent. If the legal basis for AAPG’s processing of your Personal Data is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing performed prior to the withdrawal.
You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Data by written notice to AAPG, in addition to the other methods specified herein.
