USE AND SHARING OF CUSTOMER PROVIDED INFORMATION FOR AARKI SERVICES
A Customer may provide Aarki with information about end Users for the purposes of advertising to those end Users through Aarki services. This information is passed to Aarki via the Customer, either directly or through a technology partner of the Customer. The Customer is responsible for requesting permission to use personal data from end Users for such purposes.
WHAT DATA WE RECEIVE , We receive mobile device advertising identifiers, such as Android GAID and iOS IDFA. We do not receive or store any other Personal Data on end Users from our Customers.
HOW WE USE THIS DATA. When buying media on behalf of our Customers, if we are able to buy an advertising opportunity (Impression) that matches a mobile advertising identifier of one of our Customer’s end Users we may show that end User an ad from that Customer. Not all impressions served to an end User on one of our Customer end User lists may be targeted for that end User. The end User may be served advertising from Aarki that is not specifically targeted to their mobile advertising identifier.
END USERS
Our technology and how we collect information on end Users. End Users are those that may be served advertising from Aarki on behalf of our Customers.
In providing services to our Customers, we collect information to identify end Users’ interests and activity in mobile applications. We use this information to determine what advertising we think may be most relevant to an end User to serve them the most relevant ad opportunity from our Customers. To identify end Users we use mobile device advertising identifiers, such as Android GAID and iOS IDFA, and IP information. The information we collect on end Users is provided via the mobile app or site owner to Aarki via technology partners we are integrated with that enable the buying and selling of advertising opportunities, such as banners and videos.
In addition, some of our Customers may utilize the Aarki platform to engage in re-targeting or re-engagement activities. Retargeting and re-engagement is when an advertiser (our Customer) wants to advertise to an end User that may already be using, have used, or expressed interest in their product or service. Our Customers, in their relationship with this end User/s may request and collect some personal identifier and then may provide this information to Aarki in order to retarget or re-engage the end User. The Customer will provide a mobile device advertising identifier only, such as an Android GAID or iOS IDFA to Aarki for the about consumers they are interested in reaching via advertising and the Customer is responsible for obtaining consent to use personal identifying information from the end User before providing to Aarki. As an end User you can manage the use of your device identifier for such activity by reaching out directly to the advertiser, our Customer. You can also opt out of all targeted Aarki advertising as outlined below.
OPTING-OUT AND OPTING-IN. Aarki may use non-Personal Data that we collect in mobile apps to tailor advertising to you in other mobile apps and sites. You can opt out of cross-app and cross-site use of non-Personal Data in general by:
For iOS devices, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" setting. On iOS 6 this setting is located in Settings -> General -> About -> Advertising menu. On iOS 7+, it is located in Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising menu.
For Android devices, you can "Opt out of Ads Personalization". To opt out or to find your advertising identifier go to Settings -> Accounts -> Ads.
If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from Aarki please enter your device advertising identifier. Please note, you may still be served general, non targeted advertising from Aarki.
