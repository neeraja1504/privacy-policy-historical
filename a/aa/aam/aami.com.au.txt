As the AAMI Website develops and as technology evolves, AAMI will continue to strive to provide you with better services. AAMI encourages you to review the AAMI Security and Privacy Statement periodically as it may be updated from time to time.

3) Emailing AAMI
Unless otherwise stated, when you send us an email, the contents of your email and your email address is retained by AAMI for only as long as it takes to respond to your inquiry unless you provide us with your permission to retain that information or where we believe there is a legal reason to retain the information for a longer period.
4) Information collected and how we use it
4.1 General information
The information which we will collect about you will depend on how you use the AAMI Website.
If you visit the AAMI Website to read, browse or download information, our computer system will record information such as the date and time of your visit to the AAMI Website, the pages accessed, navigation paths, broad geo-location, mouse movements and clicks, and any information downloaded. This information is used for statistical, reporting and website administration and maintenance purposes only. It is also used to improve the content and performance of the website.  We do not collect any personal information while you visit the AAMI website.
The AAMI Website also uses third party services to monitor website use. Reports derived from such monitoring services provide AAMI with aggregated information only. These reports help AAMI to maintain, administer and improve the AAMI Website.  We do not collect any personal information via these monitoring services.
The AAMI Website may offer interactive facilities including premium calculators and online application forms. If you use any interactive features, we may capture any personal information which you may enter when using these tools.
The AAMI Website may offer competitions or promotions. When you submit an entry in such a competition, AAMI  may record your contact details provided by you. AAMI may use this information to contact you at a future time.
Where practical we collect your personal information directly from you. We may collect personal information about you when you deal with us directly via telephone, letter, email, or the AAMI Website.
4.2 Obtaining an insurance quote
All personal information you provide to AAMI over the Internet while inquiring about or obtaining an insurance quotation is passed through a secure, encrypted connection. The secure connection is over a protocol called secure sockets layer (SSL). AAMI uses 128-bit SSL encryption, which provides one of the highest levels of protection against unauthorised access in order to prevent unauthorised persons from reading the information you send to AAMI while it is in transit over the Internet.
Once your personal information and any payment details have been received at the AAMI website, we take all reasonable precautions to securely pass that information to the AAMI mainframe computer operated by AAMI or by another member of the Suncorp Group on behalf of AAMI. These mainframe computers are not directly accessible through the Internet, and several levels of firewall security are employed to prevent illegitimate access to our mainframes. No details you provide to us are stored on a web server.
If you have not proceeded with your AAMI on-line quotation within 30 days of its issue, it is automatically and completely removed from our records. Within this period, your details are never stored on any web server or computer system directly connected to the Internet.
4.3 AAMI recruitment
As part of our recruitment process, we will gather information on your background, including personal information that you include on your application or resume, such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, career history, details of any competency tests or other information relating to your career.
In some circumstances, we may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about your membership of a professional or trade association or trade union; security clearance or any criminal record(s) or charges you may have had filed against you. When we need to collect this type of information, we will obtain your consent.
There may be occasions when we obtain personal information about you from a third party; for example, when receiving the results of a psychological or competency test or assessment centre results. When we need to collect this type of information, we will obtain your consent prior to you taking part in the exercise.
In relation to the collection of personal information regarding references, we will not approach any referees without your specific permission or knowledge.
Please be aware, if you do not provide AAMI with the information we require, we may be limited in our ability to consider you for employment.
We will only use your personal information collected in relation to recruitment for the primary purpose of employment with AAMI.
Should AAMI engage/employ third party contractors or vendors to perform recruitment services for us, which involves handling your personal information we will take reasonable steps to prohibit these parties from using your personal information except for the purposes for which it was supplied.
In instances where AAMI engages a third party recruitment agency to assist with our recruitment efforts, we will ensure that their privacy policy commitments compliment ours.
4.4 Third Party Sites
The AAMI Website may contain links to websites which are owned or operated by third parties independent of AAMI (“Third Party Websites”). Third Party Websites should contain their own privacy statements and, should you choose to access those Third Party Websites, they are responsible for informing you about their security and privacy practices.
5) Making an online payment to AAMI
When you make a payment on our Website using your credit card, your credit card number is passed in a secure manner between the AAMI Website and third party payment providers, such as the issuer of your credit card. Your credit card number will be recorded in a mainframe computer operated by AAMI or by another member of the Suncorp Group on behalf of AAMI, and will not be transmitted over the Internet to credit card providers or payment providers. AAMI, and any payment providers will not store your credit card details on any web server. If your credit card number is stored, it will be only for AAMI or bank record keeping purposes, and then it will be stored with an even higher level of encryption.
