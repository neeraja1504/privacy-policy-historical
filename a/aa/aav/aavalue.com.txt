It is important that visitors are fully informed about the use of their personal information. GroupLotto™ believes in 100% permission-based marketing.

This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Grouplotto™ and GroupLotto's joint marketing advertisers ("Advertisers") , whether at our Website, via email, on third party websites, via co-registration or otherwise. GroupLotto™ collects information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.).

However, where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from Grouplotto™, in accordance with the law. In addition, Grouplotto™ reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event Grouplotto™ believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if Grouplotto™ is sold or acquired, or when Grouplotto™ deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when Grouplotto™, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is collected by Grouplotto™ and any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the customer's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grouplotto™ and its affiliates and subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they have credit card information on file for specific customers but they will not share this credit card information with third parties without the customer's prior informed consent.
Grouplotto™ shares Website usage information about visitors to our Website, who have received targeted promotional campaigns, with Advertisers for the purpose of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our Advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). By registering with Grouplotto™, you agree to allow Grouplotto™ to share such Website usage information with third parties.
Grouplotto™ also reserves the right to provide aggregate or group data about Grouplotto™ users for lawful purposes.

Grouplotto™ does not endorse, nor is Grouplotto™ responsible for the accuracy of, the Privacy Policies and/or Terms and Conditions of each of the Advertisers on the Grouplotto™ Website. The entities which advertise and/or place banner ads on the Grouplotto™ Website including, but not limited to, co-registration Advertisers, are independent third parties and are not affiliated with Grouplotto™.
Grouplotto™ delivers to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use the Website. However, Grouplotto™ also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within and/or on the Website. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad networks' servers, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the Website. Please note that if an advertiser asks Grouplotto™ to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. However, Grouplotto™ only authorizes our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. To Grouplotto's knowledge, the third-party ad servers do not collect, nor does Grouplotto™ give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. In addition, Grouplotto™ uses third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for accounting and data integrity purposes.
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server and/or third-party service provider from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's and service provider’s website individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).
Currently, we have relationships with the following third party service providers and/or may display the following third party ad server networks (click to visit their website).  In addition, we may at some point engage other third-party ad servers and/or third-party service providers in the future.
