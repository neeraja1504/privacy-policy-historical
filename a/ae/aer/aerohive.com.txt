The Ways Aerohive Uses and Discloses Information
Aerohive uses Personal Information we collect when we have explicit permission from you to do so (e.g., to assist in the event of a support call) or when the Personal Information is deidentified. Deidentified data is information about you, including Personal Information, but in aggregate form or a form that a third party can no longer reasonably use to identify specifically any individual. Such deidentified data may be based in part on Personal Information about you, but it does not specifically identify you personally (e.g., by your name, etc.). Deidentified data may be collected on any users of our Services, including you. We or our third party customers or service providers may use your deidentified data for various purposes, including research or analysis on our customer demographics, internet usage, and your use history, interests and behavior. With certain Products, you may opt out of Aerohive's use of such deidentified Personal Information.
Aerohive may use automatically collected information or Personal Information for a number of reasons related to the Services, including to: (a) remember your information, including for your future use of our Products or Services or visit to the Site; (b) provide customized third-party promotions, advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor the effectiveness of the Site, our Products and Services, including aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, transactions and status in any promotions or other activities.
Aerohive may use Personal Information we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we or our third party partners or affiliates think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site and our Products and Services, to comply with Aerohive’s legal and contractual obligations, and for the purpose for which we may reasonably understand the information was provided or made available to you. For example, we or our third party partners or affiliates may use the information we collect to:
send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Site, our Products or Services, to provide other services, products or information you request and to complete any transactions in connection therewith;
respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;
request feedback and to enable us to identify, develop, customize and improve the Site, our Products or Services and business offerings (including those of our partners and affiliates);
contact you for marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes; and
achieve the purpose for which we may reasonably understand the information was provided or made available to us.
Aerohive may share your Personal Information with Aerohive's employees, agents and contractors for legitimate business reasons, including to companies that provide services to us, such as our outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities. However, these service providers may only use your Personal Information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
We may link or merge together Personal Information you provide or make available to Aerohive online with other Personal Information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our Products or Services and those of our partners or affiliates. In addition, if we receive information from third parties, we may combine this information with the other Personal Information we maintain about you. In either case, this Privacy Policy and our permitted use governs this information.
We may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site or the Products, Users, our employees or the public, including without limitation disclosures intended to protect Aerohive or Users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of the Site or our Products or Services.

You agree that Aerohive can export information it has about you, including Personal Information, to any country as Aerohive deems reasonable or operationally necessary, even if that country's privacy laws may be different from the privacy laws of your country. You also agree that Aerohive can collect, access, use, disclose and transfer your Personal Information to the extent provided in the Privacy Policy.
We may disclose or transfer information about our Users, including your Personal Information, to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.

Aerohive’s Data Practices for Its Customers
The following describe Aerohive’s data practices that are applicable in instances where Aerohive collects or processes data on behalf of partners, affiliates or other companies or entities that have purchased our Products (our “ Customers ”).
Data Ownership and Consumer Choice
When Aerohive collects information on behalf of a Customer that information is treated as belonging to the Customer, with Aerohive acting as a service provider or “ data processor ” to that Customer. The collection, use, and sharing of information Aerohive collects on behalf of its Customers is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is instead governed by the terms of each Customer’s applicable privacy policy and the terms of the agreement existing between Aerohive and that Customer. Aerohive assumes no responsibility for any treatment of such information. If you have any question or concern about the treatment of information transmitted to an Aerohive Customer using Aerohive Products, please contact that Aerohive Customer directly. Customers cannot access information Aerohive collects or processes on behalf of other Customers unless those Customers have entered into a separate agreement with us relating to information sharing.
Data Collection
Aerohive collects data in various ways through its Products and Services, including your use of this Site. This includes data collection on behalf of our Customers. For certain of our Products, Aerohive enables our Customers to allow users to log into networks that are enabled using the Users’ social network login credentials. In these instances, Users will be provided with information from their social network about the implications of connecting to the network using their social network login credentials, and will have the opportunity to choose whether to provide certain information through the network enabled with Aerohive Products or Services. This information may include the name, gender, birthday, contact information, login source, and other information relating to a user that the user’s social networks may provide to Aerohive or our Customer under the terms of service for each social network and the user’s individual privacy settings. You should review your privacy settings for each of your social network accounts to determine what information may be provided to Aerohive or our Customers. The information collected from social networks is used for user validation and verification and may also be used or combined with other data and shared or disclosed according to the terms of the Customer’s privacy policy or this Privacy Policy.
Aerohive Customers may also collect information about your online activities when using those Customers’ networks that are enabled with Aerohive Products or Services. Aerohive Customers, depending on the nature of their business, may also use Aerohive Products or Services to collect and use information that is subject to regulation under applicable data protection, privacy, or security laws. This information is also subject to the privacy policies of Aerohive’s Customers.
Data Use
Aerohive does not access, analyze, share, sell, or otherwise use or transfer any Personal Information that it collects on behalf of any Customer unless specifically authorized to do so by that Customer or by this Privacy Policy. Aerohive may process information on the behalf of its Customers to provide them with analytics data, usage information, and other information or data for the Customers to use for their business purposes.
In addition, Aerohive may extract deidentified or aggregated information from the information sent to Aerohive Customers using Aerohive Products or Services; any time we collect, use, or share that deidentified or aggregated information it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If an Aerohive Customer provides Personal Information to Aerohive for Aerohive’s use, Aerohive will also treat that information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Data Retention
If you have provided data to a Customer, the retention of that data is subject to the Customer’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy, except as described below. If you wish to amend, delete, or otherwise access data provided to a Customer through Aerohive’s Products or Services, you will need to contact the Customer directly.
Aerohive will retain Personal Information we collect or access under this Privacy Policy, or process on behalf of our Customers, for as long as needed to provide services to our Customer, and will retain and use this Personal Information beyond that point as necessary as permitted under this Policy or to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our contractual relationships.
