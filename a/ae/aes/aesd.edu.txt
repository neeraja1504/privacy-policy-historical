Privacy Notice
School Loop Privacy Notice
(last updated July 2014)
Welcome!
School Loop, Inc. ("School Loop" or "us" or "we") welcomes you to our website at www.schoolloop.com (the "School Loop Site").
We provide several services. Our website system is used to create publicly accessible web pages. School Loop Plus is a school-to-home communication and collaboration service that helps teachers, students, school staff, and parents share information about student home assignments, grades, and other school-related information. OnTrackEDU is a social dashboard system that helps education professionals support students and lead effective schools. We refer to our online applications and our website together as the "Service," and all the different types of people who have accounts on the service as "Users."
This Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use and disclosure of information submitted by Users to the Service, as well as information collected by the Service. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the School Loop Terms of Service. Your use of the School Loop Site and the Service and any information you provide on the School Loop Site or to the Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service.
If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page and in the "News" section of the Service. Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.
Your Privacy
School Loop recognizes that School Loop Users value their privacy. School Loop understands that when a User chooses to submit information to the Service, that User trusts us to act in a responsible manner. We provide this Privacy Notice to help you better understand how we protect the information submitted to the Service and who has access to the information posted by you or about you on the Service.
Who Has Access to the Service?
School Loop Plus is the only service that includes parents and students as Users. One-to-one communication between adults and children is limited to school staff, and all communication is accessible by administrators. In addition, any adult who wishes to view a student's homework information must register with a valid ID number and have his or her membership reviewed by the affected student, who may challenge the registration.
School Loop Standard is designed for staff members and other adults that the School District gives web publishing rights. OnTrackEDU is designed for education professionals who have rights to student information as defined by FERPA (the Family Education Right Protection Act).
Who Sets the Information Access Rules for the Service?
Each school or school district sets the rules for accessing the information on the Service by configuring the privacy settings for the Service. Note, Districts have privacy policies in place that govern access to information. In general, the principles outlined below apply.
What Kind of Personal Information is Stored in the Service? Who has access to this information?

Students and parents can access posted content for their current or past courses if they are the targeted audience. Access to a student's grades by the student or the student's parents depends on the policy set by the school or school district. The Service allows a school's system administrator to program the access settings in the Service accordingly. Rights to this content can be restricted by district administration.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use. Please be aware, however, that if you choose not to store a cookie, you will need to login repeatedly, because cookies are what we use to manage your sessions. We may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the site and its services (such as browser type, operating system and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer). We do not match such information with any of your personal information without expressly informing you in each particular instance. We do not capture IP or other personally identifiable information.

Third-Party Integration
By enabling any third party services (e.g. choosing to connect to and access Google Drive, a third party service, through your School Loop locker), you agree that School Loop is not responsible for the accuracy, legality, availability or reliability of any such third party services, the acts or omissions of any providers of such third party services or any information made available in connection with such third party services. Please remember that the manner in which such third party services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and School Loop will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any provider of such third party service.

However, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases.
As School Loop is a product for schools and school districts, access to student login and password information is made available to school staff. This policy is in line with the rights and responsibilities afforded to schools under State and Federal statute. All material published on School Loop by students is considered public. For parents and other adults, access to specific passwords is denied.
