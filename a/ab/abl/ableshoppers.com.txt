IP Addresses
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. An Internet Service Provider randomly assigns the IP address at the time of dial-up. For other local area network (LAN) or cable modem users, the IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer or other device connected to the network. Anytime you connect to a site on the Internet, the computers communicating with each other exchange IP addresses. IP addresses can tell things like what part of the world you're connecting from, or which Internet Service Provider you are using.
We don't collect IP addresses. Also, we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's computer session is logged, but the computer user remains anonymous. Some services we may offer, such as chat rooms or forums may from time to time display the participant's IP address along with the message poster's user name (which may be real or fictional by choice).
Mailing List
If you join our mailing list, we will never disclose your email to any thirt party. Your will only receive deal alert from Ableshoppers, about once per week.
