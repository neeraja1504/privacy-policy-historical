able2know - Privacy Policy
I. Your Privacy at Able2know
When registering at able2know you do not need to provide any information except for the bare minimum that we need for your account: a username, e-mail and a password. Unlike many other sites, we will never sell these e-mails to unscrupulous spammers. In fact, we won't sell or give e-mails to anyone, regardless of their scruples, unless we are ordered to do so by law.
We collect no personally identifying information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide this information to us.
There is nothing we know of that we can do to show more respect for your privacy, but if you have any suggestions on how we can improve our commitment to your privacy, please don't hesitate to contact us.
II. What We Collect and Store Automatically
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. Rather, information is kept in the aggregate. We automatically collect and store only the information about your visit. We use the information we collect to understand the traffic to our site; for example, it's important to know how much bandwidth the site uses so that we can purchase more if needed; if the "hits" to our site increase, we need to pay more money for better hosting. This kind of information helps us make our site more useful to visitors like you.
III. If You Send Us E-mail
You may choose to provide us with personal information, such as when you e-mail us with a comment or question. We use that information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.
