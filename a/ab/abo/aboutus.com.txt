PRIVACY AND INFORMATION COLLECTION POLICY
This privacy and information collection policy explains how we obtain information made available on the  http://www.aboutus.com  website (the “Site”), and governs the information you provide us, whether actively (e.g., personally Identifiable Information you submit to us) or passively (e.g., information we obtain through the use of Cookies). The policy does not govern the entries or edits (content) you submit to the Site. That information is dealt with separately at this link  Terms and Conditions of Use  . Any revised privacy and information collection policy shall be effective immediately after it is posted on the Site, either at this location or at any other location accessible via the front page of the Site.
If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact AboutUs.com at privacy@aboutus.com or send mail to AboutUs.com at 107 SE Washington, Portland, OR U.S. We will endeavor to respond to every inquiry. However, the volume of inquiries we receive at any given time may prevent us from promptly responding to your inquiry.
Verification of User Provided Entries:
AboutUs is a user generated site. At this point we do not verify the identity of any user who provides information or edits. You should know we have not taken steps to verify any information and, to the extent necessary, you should verify this information yourself before relying on it.
AboutUs Respects Intellectual Property Rights:
AboutUs absolutely respects the intellectual property rights of third parties. It will never engage in acts which constitute copyright or trademark infringement. AboutUs is intended for the Internet community to promote the free flow of information about domain names and related websites. Here, you will find information about websites, which is intended to be informative, educational, critical, and accurate. We do not publish text or images from a site for the purpose of providing the text or images, but rather we make them available to provide information about the site itself. We cannot accurately provide complete information about a site without tracking a small amount of information from the site itself.
AboutUs provides information which may not be entitled to copyright protection in the first instance. To the extent it does, AboutUs’s display of reduced thumbnail-size images and of publicly available text falls under “fair use”. Both copyright and trademark law contain exceptions for “fair use”. Fair use is a statutorily recognized exception to copyright law, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107. Trademark law fair use principles generally track copyright law fair use. United States courts employ a four factor test to determine whether a use constitutes “fair use” under copyright law. Under this test, AboutUs’s use constitutes fair use. First, AboutUs’s use of the information is transformatively different from the original expressive purpose of the information. AboutUs has gathered this information in one place in a central directory format for the purpose of providing knowledge about domain names and web sites, open to user editing. Second, AboutUs does not exploit the expressive value of text or images we make available, but rather we use the text and images to educate and inform users about the domain names and website at which the complete text and full images may be found. Third, the reduced or truncated use of the images and information is consistent with AboutUs’s transformative purpose. Finally, AboutUs does not harm the market for the underlying information. By reproducing information about your website we are merely increasing potential exposure for your website. This will enlarge your “market” rather than harm it. AboutUs’s use of the information thus constitutes fair use under application of the fair use test. You can find additional information and discussion about AboutUs’s stance on fair use and intellectual property policy at this link  Intellectual Property Policy  .
