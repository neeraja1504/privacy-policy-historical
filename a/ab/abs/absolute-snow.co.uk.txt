The Absoute-Snow Privacy Policy
The Boarding Company Limited considers user privacy and data protection to be of high importance and complies with the Data Protection Act 1998 in relation to the processing of data supplied to us by users and other personal data in our possession for any reason.
No staff at The Boarding Company Limited are able to see any of your credit or debit card information. This information is held by Sage Pay, our payment providers. Sage Pay are the UK’s largest provider of online credit and debit card processing services. When we provide refunds to your card, we cannot see any of your card information at this time either. This makes purchasing online with The Boarding Company Limited's websites far more secure than any in-store, mail order or telephone purchase.
All transaction information passed between The Boarding Company Limited's websites and Sage Pay is encrypted using 128-bit SSL certificates. No cardholder information is ever passed unencrypted and any messages sent to our servers by Sage Pay are signed using MD5 hashing to prevent tampering. You can be completely secure in the knowledge that nothing we pass to the Sage Pay servers can be examined, used or modified by any third parties attempting to gain access to sensitive information.
Once on the Sage Pay systems, all sensitive data is secured using the same internationally recognised 256-bit encryption standards used by, among others, the US Government. The encryption keys are held on state-of-the-art, tamper proof systems in the same family as those used to secure VeriSign’s Global Root certificate, making them all but impossible to extract. The data Sage Pay hold is extremely secure and is regularly audited by the banks and banking authorities to ensure it remains so.
Sage Pay has multiple private links into the banking network that are completely separate from the Internet and which do not cross any publicly accessible networks. Any cardholder information sent to the banks and any authorisation message coming back is encrypted and secure and cannot be tampered with.
No individuals within Sage Pay are able to decrypt transaction information or cardholder data. Sage Pay systems only allow access to their most senior staff and only in extenuating circumstances (such as investigations of Card Fraud by the Police). Your transaction information and customer card information is secure even from Sage Pay’s own employees because their systems never display the full card numbers, even on administration screens.
