If you do not register, general technical user data, such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the date and time of your visit, may be automatically collected through the use of “cookies” (small files that are stored on your computer by a website to give you a unique identification) or other technologies. Cookies also keep track of services you have used, record registration information regarding your login name and password, ensure you do not repeatedly see survey questions, record your preferences and keep you logged into the Absolutdata site.
Information You Actively Submit
Generally
If you visit and / or sign up on our Sites for our blog/newsletter, you may provide contact information such as your name, email address, mailing address and company affiliation.
If you use our/Sub-contractor Sites as a Respondent, you will provide demographic information about yourself and answer questions at your choice which may include political opinion, sexual orientation, health and genetic data. In each such case, you know what information you provide and we collect, because you will actively submit the information.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
In order to deliver the services, we require opt-in consent from European Union Respondents prior to the collection and processing of your Personal Data. The various modes of collection of data are stated below:
*  **Panels**
When you consent to our collection of your Personal Data, we act as a Controller of that data whether collected on our Sites from you or received from our panels. Our customers may receive Personal Data collected pursuant to your opt-in consent on our Sites and as such, our customers are Joint Controllers of that data. In addition, we may share Personal Data collected on our Sites with our customers when performing the Managed Services below; when our customers receive such Personal Data, they are Joint Controllers of that data.
*  Managed Services
We also offer managed services to our customers. With regard to the control and processing of your Personal Data when we’re performing these managed services, Absolutdata is the Processor and our customers are the Controllers. Our customers provide instructions to us for the processing of your Personal Data, which typically includes using our panels to perform those managed services. In addition, our customers may instruct us to collect your Personal Data from panels to share with our customers; we are relying on the consents given to your panels to allow this processing. You should rely on our customers for obtaining your consent to process your Personal Data as part of the surveys conducted off the panels.
Combination & Synchronization
We may combine and synchronize information that your device transmits, information that you actively submit and information that we obtain from third party sources (including suppliers of market research sample and data marketing platforms that may direct you to our Sites to answer demographic questions about yourself in preparation for your completion of surveys, and web publishers, advertisers, data brokers and online service providers that may have obtained information from you or your devices via cookies, pixels,  and other tracking technologies).
Business Information
We do collect employee contact names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of our business partners, including buyers, suppliers and vendors, for the administration of our business relationships. If you feel that your personal data or personally identifiable information is being collected inappropriately, please notify us at  privacy@absolutdata.com.
Cookie Opt-Out

Information Tracking Technologies
We may use, and allow third parties to use, Pixels (sometimes called web beacons) on our Sites (or other third-party sites) to monitor the effectiveness of survey qualifications. Pixels may be linked to your Personal Information, and they collect the IP address of the device to which the web beacon is sent (for geolocation lookup), the URL of the page the web beacon comes from, the user agent string (for device lookup), and the time it was viewed. We may also use third-party devices, links or electronic mail, to deliver surveys to you during which additional Personal Information may be collected. These third-party surveys or devices may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect information about your visits to our Sites (or other third-party sites) in order to present surveys that may be applicable to you. We may collect traffic information and data on and from the use of third-party sites on behalf of our customers. Absolutdata may use a Pixel or cookie to examine what is happening on third-party websites, including programs and sites with marketing and advertising partners, to improve the understanding of site traffic at a granular level, market research effectiveness and other services provided.Respondents that are hosted on, accessed by or routed through the third-party sites should consult the privacy policy and other policies of third parties through whom they are providing information. These third-parties may collect and use data that has been augmented by our services for their own services, which may include marketing and ad targeting, among other uses.
Do Not Track
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and our website is not currently set up to respond to those signals for tracking on our website.
Purpose & Use of Collected Personal Information
We use your information to operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing and improving our services; managing our communications; and analyzing our products).
If you provide us with your name and contact information, we will use this information to answer requests from you, communicate with you regarding any services we are providing to you as well as inform you about new products and services (unless and until you opt-out of marketing information).
If you come to our Sites as a “Respondent” to qualify for or take surveys, we use the demographic information you provide to make your survey answers more meaningful to us and our clients. We may also use information derived from cookies, pixels and other technologies to determine your interests in particular surveys, advertisements and other communications.
Information Retention & Accuracy
We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information we receive, process, or maintain is accurate, complete, and reliable for its intended use. We rely on the accuracy of the information provided directly to us but accept responsibility for the management and confidentiality of the Personal Information collected.
In general, we keep Personal Information only as long as we need it to provide you the services you requested. We may also process data on behalf of third parties who have engaged us. We keep Personal Information processed on behalf of third parties for as long as needed to provide services to third party in question. However, we reserve the right to retain Personal Information for any period required by law or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Data Minimization
We take every reasonable step to ensure that your user Information that we process is limited to the User Information reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy or as required to provide you services or access to the Services.

With your consent.

upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and
