ABBYY Privacy Policy
ABBYY USA Software House, Inc. (“ ABBYY ,” “ we ” or “ us ”) has created this website (the “ Website ” or the “ Site ”) to provide a platform for sales, registration, and support for ABBYY's character recognition, data capture, linguistics, and translation products and services.
ABBYY is committed to maintaining your privacy.  This Privacy Notice (“ Privacy Notice ”) outlines our privacy practices, including the types of information that you may provide to us, how we use such information and the choices you have regarding our use of that information.  We may collect the information through our Website; when you purchase, register or use our products through computers or mobile devices; through our online support services; or through email messages that we send to you (collectively, including all online methods, the “ Services ”), or offline, such as when you attend one of our trade shows or contact our customer service line.  Our Privacy Notice applies to (i) casual visitors to our Site, who do not participate in the Services (“ Site Visitors ”), (ii) individuals who purchase or register products through the Website or otherwise participate in our Services (“ Registered Users ”), (iii) users of our products and (iv) individuals whose information we obtain offline (collectively, including Site Visitors, Registered Users, users of products, and other individuals, “ you ”).
1. Notice.
1.1.  The Types of Information You May Provide. Information you may provide or that we may collect from you while visiting our Site or while participating in our Services falls into three broad categories: (i) Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Activities Information, and (iii) Anonymous Information.

1.3. Activities Information. We use the term “ Activities Information ” to refer to information collected by so-called “persistent identifiers” such as cookies and web beacons. Unlike Personally Identifiable Information, Activities Information does not directly identify a particular person; the information, however, is or can potentially be linked to a particular computer or device.
1.4. Anonymous Information. “ Anonymous Information ” is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our products and Services, your access to content on our Website, or the pages on our Site that you visit most frequently.
2. Choice and consent.
We have structured our Website so that you may visit our Site without revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully.
