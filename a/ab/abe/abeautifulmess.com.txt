USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES
A Beautiful Mess pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow A Beautiful Mess to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. A Beautiful Mess may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. A Beautiful Mess prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
