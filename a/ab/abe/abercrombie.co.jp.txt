Information We Collect Online
1. General Browsing
We collect general information about our visitors’ experience with our Websites/Apps and this general information is not connected to personally identifiable information about individual visitors. This general information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider or your IP address) will provide us with information regarding the general use of our Websites/Apps. The information collected includes which pages our visitors are viewing on our Websites/Apps and whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites/Apps. It also includes information on the type of browser and service provider used. For visitors using a mobile version of our Websites, this includes technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookies supported by the device, and how images may appear. All of this information helps us provide a better experience for our visitors by being able to determine such things as how to best format our mobile Websites/Apps for various devices, our most desired pages, products and features, how to best direct visitors to our Websites/Apps, and where there might be browser or service provider connection issues.
2. Location Information
Our Website, Apps, and communications may use your IP address to determine the approximate location of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores. Mobile devices include your cell phone, and could include your laptop or tablet depending on the type of wireless connectivity used. If you do not consent to provide or disable location-based services, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Websites, Apps or communications may not be available. See the “Opt-Out” section below for the choices you have regarding collection of location information.
3. Personal Data

If you complete a general "Contact Us" form on one of our Websites we may collect your name, email address, and any information that you provide in the text of your message.
If you use the Click to Chat feature on our Websites we may collect your name and any additional personal data or other information that you provide throughout the communication.
Sign Up for Marketing Email List
If you sign up for our marketing email list, or the marketing email list for any of our affiliate brands, you will be asked to provide your email address. Our affiliate brands are: Hollister Co. and abercrombie kids. Signing up enables you to receive information about products and offers that we provide via email. Once you sign up you will receive an email to the email address you submitted confirming you are subscribed. In some locations on our Websites/Apps you are given the opportunity to submit additional information, such as gender and date of birth, that will help us cater messaging and marketing emails we send to you. In addition, we may identify you when you click a link in an email to get to our Websites, and may personalize messaging, promotions or product recommendations.

We do not review any information provided in the message content. You should not send postcards or items to friends unless you believe your friend would be interested and want to receive the information.

If a payment card has expired we will indicate this by highlighting it in red on the Payment Info page, and you can remove this expired payment type and insert a new one if desired. You will have the option to add a new payment type during checkout by ticking a box indicating that you want to store the newly entered payment details in your account.

The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device. The information collected when visiting our Websites may include the following: an IP address, the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Websites; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account, or sign in and where you go on our Websites once signed in; whether you complete a transaction; whether you have previously completed a survey; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of the Websites, your specific interaction with our Websites, and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Websites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Websites by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, our Websites use cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited one of our Websites in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on one of our Websites. Our Websites also use cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our Websites. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may also use, Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Websites and in emails.

Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Websites. Pixel Tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with our Websites as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Websites and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
In addition, our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites and we may collect information related to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.

We contract with third party advertising companies to serve you online display and banner advertisements on other websites. To serve this advertising, these third parties may place, use or rely on technology, such as cookies and/or Pixel Tags, to collect information about your interactions with our Websites and Apps and interactions with other websites. These advertising companies may use and share the information gathered to deliver our ads more tailored to your interests on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks and/or search engines. We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness.
