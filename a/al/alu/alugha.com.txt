Scope of application
With this data protection declaration, users receive information about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of their data by the responsible provider.
The Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG) form the legal framework for data protection.
Collection of general information
With every access to this offer, information is automatically collected by us or the web space provider. This information, also known as server log files, is of a general nature and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person.
Among other things, the following is recorded: name of website, file, date, data volume, web browser and web browser version, operating system, domain name of your internet provider, the so-called referrer URL (the page from which you accessed our website) and the IP address.
Without this data it would be technically impossible to deliver and display website contents. In this respect, the collection of data is mandatory. In addition, anonymous information is used for statistical purposes. It helps to optimize our services and technology. We also reserve the right to check log files if there is suspicion of any illegal use of our services.
Handling of personal data
Definition: Personal data is any information that uniquely identifies a person. It is therefore data that can be traced back to an individual.
Such personal data includes the first name and surname, telephone number as well as e-mail address. Personal data also includes information on hobbies, memberships and preferences as well as websites that have been accessed.
This data is only collected, used and if necessary, passed on by the provider if the legislator expressly permits this or if the user agrees to the collection, processing, use and to the disclosure of the data.
Registration on our website
Personal data is collected when you register on our website to take advantage of personalised services; this will include your name, address, telephone number and email address in the form of contact/communication data.

We will also amend or delete data on request, provided legal retention obligations do not preclude this. Please use the contact details shown in this data protection policy for any enquiries or requests for amendment or deletion of data.

To provide paid services, there is the requirement for additional data to be provided to us, such as payment details.
To protect your data during the transmission we use current state of the art encryption methods (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.
Comment function
If comments or other contributions are written and published on our website, we store the IP address, the user name and the time of creation. These data are collected for security reasons, since the provider can be prosecuted for illegal content (prohibited propaganda, insults, etc.), even if they were created by third parties. In such a case, the information is used to determine the identity of the author.

If you contact us via the online form or by email, we will store the information you provide in order to answer your inquiry and ask possible follow-up questions.
