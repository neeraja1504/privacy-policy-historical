Privacy Policy | PetSmart Charities
General and Donor Privacy Policy
PetSmart Charities® wants you to know how we collect, use, share and protect information about you.  By interacting with us, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as we describe in this privacy policy.  We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we urge you to review it periodically. This policy applies only to residents of the United States. If you are a resident of Canada, please click here for applicable information.
What Information is Collected
Types of personal information we collect include:
Your name
Your mailing address
Your e-mail address
Your phone (or mobile) number
Your credit/debit card number
Your donation information
Your date of birth or age
Your location
Your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, veterinary information, photographs, etc.)
If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with requested services or information.
Automated Information Collection
We may connect information collected automatically with information we may already have about you.  If we are able to identify you as a PetSmart Charities supporter, we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in one of our Adoptions Centers.  This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in-person, mobile, etc.
PetSmart Charities Automated Information Collection
We and our Service Providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device.  This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of device you are using, donation information, search terms and geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our outreach efforts more relevant.  These technologies also enable us to provide features such as text (SMS/MMS) messages you have chosen to receive.  We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention and other purposes.
In order to provide the best online experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are using our website, performance of our outreach efforts, and your response to those outreach efforts.
Third-Party Automated Information Collection
In certain instances, we allow third-party organizations to collect certain information from you when you visit our website and to use that information to provide requested services and information to you.  These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.
Mobile App and Mobile Website
If you access the PetSmart Charities website through a mobile device, the same type of information outlined throughout this policy may be collected.
User Experience Information
In order to improve your online experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our representatives in resolving issues you may experience in completing online donations or other online activities on our site, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g., information entered during donation process), and browser information.
Social Media Widgets
PetsmartCharities.org includes social media features, such as the Facebook interactive buttons, Google Plus, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter widgets.  These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.  Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.  Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect data that’s publicly available.  For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social media) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience.  You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.
We also may obtain information provided by third parties.  For instance, we may obtain information from organizations that can enhance our existing supporter information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our supporters (for example, adding address information).  This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our outreach efforts by providing better information that may interest you.
Facility Cameras
PetSmart Charities’ Adoption Centers sometimes occupy space within PetSmart stores.  In-store cameras are used for security and operational purposes such as measuring and observing customer traffic patterns. You may access the PetSmart, Inc. Privacy Policy by clicking here.
