Payment Card Industry Data Security Compliance (PCI DSS)

It incorporates the requirements of the Visa USA Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) and the Visa International Account Information Security (AIS) program, the MasterCard International Site Data Protection (SDP) program, as well as the security requirements of American Express DSS, DiscoverCard DISC etc., VISA and MasterCard now require all merchants to adhere to the PCI security standard. Our compliance with PCI standards is certified by a certified PCI compliance services provider.

Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act Compliance (HIPAA)
With an array of certifications related to Information Security in our kitty, we understand that being HIPAA compliant will take our data security management towards next paradigm. In line with this philosophy, apart from being PCI DSS complaint, Allsec's expertise in data security management has extended to being HIPAA compliant. HIPAA exclusively defines the security requirements for the service industry required for protecting the electronic personal health information (EPHI). Customized controls ranging from physical security, security of network and system components that store, retrieve & transmit customer's data are deployed practicing the best- in-class operational procedures. Our model of layered security controls, appetite for Compliance & continuous improvement in Information Security lead to Clients' satisfaction and appreciation as we always experience.
SAS 70 Type II
The SAS 70 audit is one of the most demanding certifications that a data center operator can undergo because it examines all aspects of the internal control system. Not only must the controls be present, they must also be documented and verified. Allsec is a SAS 70 Type II Certified organization since 2007 consistently maintaining the effectiveness and efficiency of the controls periodically evaluated bi-annually after they were placed in operation. This assures our clients that the control system is functioning properly and there is a review of controls applicable for the Clients' programs from time to time which is one of the key process steps of SAS 70 Type II audit.
ISO 27001:2005
While PCI DSS and SAS 70 caters to strategic management of information & data security, at an operational level an information security program that can act as a solid foundation for all the Compliance programs is required. ISO 27001:2005 is an International standard that provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and provides a healthy foundation. We are ISO 27001 certified. Healthy sustenance requires combination of Quality Management System also to control its environment. Realizing this fact, Allsec has implemented ISO :27001 as an integrated management system of both Information security and Quality. Our environment of internal controls, across all of our accreditations undergoes not only the tight scrutiny through internal security audits but also quality process audits. Business Continuity Management / Disaster Recovery systems and Information Security governance structure enforced by ISO 27001:2005 enable Allsec to maintain secure IT environment.
