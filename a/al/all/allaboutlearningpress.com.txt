Privacy
This page provides information about the privacy policy of this website and its related apps (mobile and otherwise).
Our policy is simple: we do not collect personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information.
You can rest assured that your private information will be respected and protected.
Your e-mail address will only be used to communicate with you about your order, reply to your questions, or, if you signed up for our e-newsletter, to send you information about blog posts, new products, and special deals.
We do not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party.
We do not market to children under 13. If a child emails us via a “Contact Us“ link and we can identify the sender as a child, any personally identifiable information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such child. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a child is sending or posting personally identifiable information on any area of our website, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally identifiable information as soon as practicable.
If you have any questions about how we handle and protect your information, feel free to contact us.
