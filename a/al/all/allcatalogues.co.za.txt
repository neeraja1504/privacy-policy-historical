2. Allcatalogues.co.za Cookies Policy
Cookies are small pieces of text that Internet sites store in your computer through your web browser. Their use started in the mid 90s, and at the moment Cookies represent one of the most globally used Internet technologies.  They cannot spread viruses or grant access to your hard disk though. Therefore, we cannot read any information stored in your hard disk even if it stores cookies as well.
The basic website functions rely on Cookies. Thanks to them, information and online ads are received which you will most probably find interesting or appropriate. On the other hand, with no Cookies you cannot shop online because Cookies are used for storing the items you select in your shopping cart.
The cookies used in Allcatalogues.co.za do not collect any of your personal information or any other kind of personal details, and they cannot cause any harm to your personal computer, tablet or mobile phone. We use Cookies to grant you optimal Internet use and, on the other hand, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the website. This section of our privacy policy provides clear and comprehensive information on the Cookies we use as well as on the purposes we use them for.
What information will be stored by a Cookie?
Usually a Cookie stores:
The URL of the website it comes from;
Expiry of the Cookie or the period of time it will stay on your personal computer or phone;
Value – usually a randomly generated unique number.
How long do Cookies stay on your computer?
Session cookies – these Cookies are on until the browser is closed. They are not stored on your hard disk and are usually used to track the pages you visit in order to personalise the information extracted about this specific visit of yours.

It is important to note once again that Cookies do not store your personal details. That is why our Marketing Department, working with the web analysis tools, is not able to identify you personally. In this case, the important facts we receive are of the following type: how much time it takes for a given page to load or what type of information is most searched for by the users, as well as the time and duration of use and information about the way the users browse the website. These Cookies are also useful for us whenever the website does not work properly. In such cases the Cookies helps us localise the problem and solve it.
We use the third type of Cookies in order to decide where to position our online ads and to define their efficiency.

Same as with the other two types, this type of Cookie does not collect your personal information or data.
