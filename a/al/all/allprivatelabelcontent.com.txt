We do not share this data with anyone unless you explicitly consent to us doing so and will comply with your wishes to remove your data from our systems at any time. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the AllPrivateLabelContent.com website. If you have any questions or comments regarding the following information, please contact us here.
The data we collect is used for the following purposes:
To provide you with access to the products, services, newsletters and other programs we offer. To analyze profile and/or behavioral data to help us improve our offerings to you. In some cases we will be contractually obligated to share your data with a third party advertiser or partner. For example, if we partner with someone to provide you with training events, downloads or other special programs. In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you share will be transferred to the third party. You always have the option to not have your data shared by not taking part in the offer. We will never use or share your information except as described above. Some information, such as IP and your email address, may be shared with the following third parties who help us run our website, marketing and email programs. They only use this information to serve our needs and are prohibited from using it in any other instance. 3rd Party Services we currently work with are: Google (website data tracking & analysis), Aweber (email acquisition, product and service delivery, news and announcements), Formidable Forms (customer support and feedback forms).
Failure to provide consent:
Consenting to allow us to process and store your data is optional. However, failure to provide that consent will prevent us from delivering to you the products, services and other experiences mentioned above.
The information we collect:
Throughout our web platform, content, services, trainings and other events, you will be presented with the opportunity to submit your information to gain access to newsletters, products, services, events and more. Most opportunities only require your name and email address, though some may ask for more such as your title, location and so forth. We do not store your credit or debit card information. This is handled by 3rd party payment processors, PayPal and 2Checkout, in order to complete the transaction in which you are engaging.
