What information do we collect?

Certain information that we request is necessary for us to provide one or more All Allergies services to you. Other information is optional. However, if you elect not to provide this optional information, this choice may limit the value of the All Allergies experience for you. For example, if we do not have your children’s ages, we will not be able to provide information about their developmental stages or suggestions for age appropriate games and activities. As you can see, the more information we have about you, the more valuable the All Allergies experience can be for you.
All Allergies may collect or track the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with the Site via e-mail and information knowingly provided by the visitor in online registration forms, information requests, the “Contact Us” section of the Site, and other online resources.

Generally, in addition to the other uses and features described in this Privacy Policy, we use this information to improve your All Allergies experience by tailoring the content displayed in your version of the Site to the information that we describe in this paragraph.
In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your All Allergies membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you). We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members.

Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Web Site may result in certain parts of the Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. For example, if you are a All Allergies member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the Web Site.
The information collected by cookies helps us generate customized content, and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.
