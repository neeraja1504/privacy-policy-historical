AllEarsNet LLC, (AllEarsNet) owns and operates AllEars.net® , which comprises the Unofficial Walt Disney World Information Guide , the ALL EARS® weekly newsletter and its companion promotional newsletter Ears the Deal™.
AllEarsNet has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the users' privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for AllEars.net ®.
AllEars.net® is committed to your privacy, and does not sell, exchange, or release any of your individual personal information to a third party.
SCOPE OF POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies only to AllEars.net ®. This privacy policy does not apply to other companies' or organizations' websites that you may link to. You should carefully review the Privacy Policy of other websites to determine how they treat personal information.
INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND STORED
When you browse through any web site, certain personal information about you can be collected. Like most standard web site servers we use log files. We automatically collect and temporarily store information about your visit. We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. The data collected may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, domain name, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This data is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Your IP number is visible to most of the websites that you visit. AllEars.net ® may use IP numbers to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web site.
AllEars.net® utilizes a number of outside vendors to operate portions of the website and/or newsletter. For instance,campaigner.com, drip.com and InfusionSoft are used for newsletter ( ALL EARS® and Ears the Deal ™) distribution, and adspeed.com for banner ad programs. Please see those sites for their privacy information.

The only personally identifiable information about you that is collected is that which you provide on a voluntary basis. We make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide is maintained in a secure environment.
AllEarsNet will not knowingly or intentionally disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.
If you choose to subscribe to our weekly newsletter, ALL EARS® , you will have to provide an e-mail address. ALL EARS® is only delivered electronically.
AllEarsNet utilizes adspeed.com for banner rotation and statistics. adspeed.com maintains information on each visitor and all associated data for the last 30 days. Other information is kept in compact forms. adspeed.com also tracks how many people are currently active on the site, where they are and came from, which ads were viewed at what time. AllEarsNet® webmasters have access to this information.
INFORMATION USE
We reserve the right to perform statistical analysis of user behavior and characteristics while visiting this site. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the site. We may share this information in the aggregate with advertisers or potential advertisers. We will use information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and how many have clicked on them. We provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties. Advertisers will not be able to identify any individual from the data provided.
COOKIES
A cookie is a mechanism that allows a website to record your comings and goings, usually without your knowledge or consent. ALL EARS® does not require cookies of its visitors. However, our banner rotation program is administered by a third party and may contain cookies. We do not have access to this cookie information. We use Google Analytics to track website usage, visitors, what pages are viewed, and obtain aggregate demographics. We can not see your personal information.

REGISTRATION FORMS
The only registration form is for subscription to ALL EARS® , the weekly newsletter sent to subscribers' e-mail addresses.
The ALL EARS® registration form requires users to provide an e-mail address and requests demographic information (like zip code and country).
