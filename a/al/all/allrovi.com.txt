** YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED**
In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the Rovi Properties. Any data we gather through your use of Rovi Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is collected as you use Rovi Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use Rovi Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a "cookie" (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on Rovi Property. Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information to better provide products and services, including, without limitation, to better target advertising and content, and to generate statistics and reports.
You may use certain Rovi Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with the Rovi Property even though we don’t know who you are.In respect of certain Rovi Properties which are products, Rovi may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple Rovi Properties, Rovi may combine or link information collected from various Rovi Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
Personal information
As is common across websites, to use certain features of Rovi Property we ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in your profile).  When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.
Rovi may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the Rovi Properties. To enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.
To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general Rovi will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and you consent to our so doing.
In respect of 'Roxio' branded Rovi Property, registering your product indicates that you have informed us of your interest in receiving offers and information from us and from third parties and we will contact you after registration unless you specify that you do not wish to receive such contact by notifying us at legal@rovicorp.com. For those who elect to receive such materials from third parties, Rovi may release personal information to those third parties. Information released may include your name, email address and other information supplied in the Rovi registration process.
Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.

** TRACKING INFORMATION - COOKIES, FLASH COOKIES , CLEAR GIFS, AND IP ADDRESSES**
We store and track user information by using "cookies" and clear GIFs, which are also sometimes called web bugs or web beacons. Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information. However, information provided through cookies may be associated with personal information if you provide this information to us by, for example, registering to use certain Rovi Properties. A cookie is data sent to your browser from a web server. It is stored on your computer and contains a unique identifier that allows our sites to recognize your computer. If you have an account with Rovi, a cookie on your computer lets us remember your user name and password so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit the site. Another cookie is a Flash cookie that is embedded in the Adobe Flash Player, which is a web tool that allows rapid development of dynamic content. Adobe Flash cookies may be used in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation and to remember settings, preferences and usage. They are similar to 'browser' cookies (as described above) but are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser.
The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and you will find they are currently used by many major websites. You can set your web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. We do not require you to use cookies, but please keep in mind that certain features and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies.
"Clear GIFs" are very small image files that we sometimes place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters or other communication we send. Clear GIFs let us accurately count the number of users who have visited specific pages and the number of times those pages are accessed. Clear GIFs also let us know how many people opened an email.
We may use cookies, clear GIFs and related tracking technology to collect information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services used and how you have used them.
We may provide data about our users, traffic patterns, products, services and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business partners), but we will use reasonable efforts to provide it in a form that does not directly identify you.
Find out how to disable/enable browser cookies by clicking on the "Manage Cookies" section of the Interactive Advertising Bureau website on the following link http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. You may access and manage Flash management tools such as flash cookies from Adobe's web site directly at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html.

** EMAIL**
Email addresses are used for identification, inviting new friends to Rovi Properties, searching for and finding friends, general communication, order processing and to send notifications to you. To facilitate searching for and finding friends on the Rovi Properties, Rovi allows users to search for other members using text searches, first and last name, email address, and by using other attributes. Users can invite friends to join certain Rovi Properties by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Where permitted by applicable law, Rovi stores these email addresses so that the respondents may be added to the friend list of the member sending the invitations and to establish relationships between users.
