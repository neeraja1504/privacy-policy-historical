Allied Electronics - Privacy Policy
General
This privacy policy covers alliedelec.com and all of its subdomains. You can access our website home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. However, while visiting the Allied Electronics site, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for the purpose of interacting with our site, including, for example, when you ask for information, enter a contest, order subscriptions, or download material. This policy describes how Allied Electronics will use your Personal Information if you choose to share your Personal Information with Allied Electronics. Allied Electronics uses your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site and to continue to communicate with you regarding goods or services you may be interested in. We provide your Personal Information to our email service provider, with whom we have a written confidentiality agreement to protect such information. We track the domains from which this site is visited and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics, and then discard it. If you choose not to have your Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you by Allied Electronics, you may "opt out". If you choose not to give us your Personal Information, you can still use most of this site. You merely will not be able to access areas that require registration.
Children's Privacy
Allied Electronics does not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal data from children and does not provide services designed to allow children to make their personal information available online. Nor does Allied Electronics take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal data to it. If you are under the age of 13, you should not disclose your personal data to Allied Electronics.
What personal information do alliedelec.com and its subdomains collect from me?
Our website collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, our site asks you for a user name, password, your name, telephone number, fax number, email address, company name, and address. In order to register, you must provide all of this information. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to alliedelec.com or its subdomains and are able to take full advantage of the site.
In addition, we keep copies of information you submit when you send email feedback to the site, ask a technical question, or report a problem. If you contact us in writing through our site we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also occasionally ask users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes.
We do not intend to collect any sensitive personal information on our website and therefore you should not include any sensitive personal information (e.g. data relating to your health, finances, sexual orientation, religion, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions) on your profile or otherwise on our website.
What are cookies and how do alliedelec.com and its subdomains use them?
A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Allied Electronics pages may use cookies so that we may better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Different browsers offer different ways to manage, limit, or delete the kind of cookies that may be placed on your system. When you choose a browser, you may want to give consideration to these issues.
Our website uses a session cookie to enable e-commerce functionality. When you enter the Allied Electronics website, a cookie is sent to your browser. The cookie is stored by your browser and written to your hard disk. This cookie contains a number generated by the Allied Electronics web server. It is used to uniquely identify your browser for the duration of your visit to the Allied Electronics site. This cookie is used to gather information about your username, cart ID, persistent login information and your preferred website country and language. The cookie is used to link you to your unique order, help you remain logged in and route you to your preferred alliedelec.com website.
Alliedelec.com also uses cookies from third party providers, to track general user behavior, which is used to provide a better overall customer experience. No personally identifiable information is stored or tracked through the use of this cookie. Any ‘do not track’ signals would be received and handled by such third party.
These cookies are similar to locker keys in that, as you interact with our site (add an item to your shopping cart), information is stored for you in a locker on the Allied Electronics server. A cookie is the key to this locker and the information contained within. Because these keys are unique to you, they ensure that your information is secured and cannot be accessed by anyone else.
After 90 days, or when you clear your cookies, the cookie within your browser and the corresponding data will be deleted and your session ended.
How do alliedelec.com and its subdomains use my information?
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with customized and relevant information when you visit the site. We also research our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us through registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We also use your information for the purposes of order fulfillment and occasional direct marketing activities. For more information about how we use this information, and with whom it may be shared, see below.
Who is collecting information?
When you are on our website and are asked for personal information, you are providing that information to Allied Electronics or its parent company, Electrocomponents plc, alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Please be aware that our site has links to other sites which may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to alliedelec.com, other than any alliedelec.com subdomains, are not covered by this privacy policy. If you access any third party sites from our website, you do so entirely at your own risk.
With whom does alliedelec.com and its subdomains share my information?
Information collected about you via our website will be used only within Allied Electronics or its parent company, Electrocomponents plc, except as described herein. Allied Electronics never sells, rents, or gives away information that personally identifies customers to third parties except in the case where one or more of our businesses may be outsourced and the provision of such information is an essential part of the service requirement. For example, Allied Electronics may utilize the services of a software services provider to send targeted marketing materials to you and other Allied Electronics customers. Under such circumstances, the security and confidentiality of personal information would form part of the legal agreement between us and the supplier. From time to time, we may release aggregated marketing statistics to business partners, or may use these in press releases, advertising, or published reports. We would only personally identify you or any other customer in such press releases, advertising, or reports with prior consent. Allied Electronics may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Allied Electronics rights or property, other alliedelec.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. In addition, Allied Electronics may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?
We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
