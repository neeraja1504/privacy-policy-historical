Use of Cookies & How We Use Your Information
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. Allegiant Air uses cookies, but we do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.
We use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. This information helps us to serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.
We allow certain third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, e-mail address, telephone number or any other personally identifiable information) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Such third parties do not collect personally identifiable information.
In order to provide you with certain services, we may share relevant customer information (for example: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) with our affiliates, as well as with unaffiliated third parties who perform services for Allegiant Air (e.g., rental car, lodging and travel accommodation companies, information systems maintenance and development providers, data archiving, customer communication, marketing and similar services). Please refer to the websites of such third parties and suppliers for their privacy policies and other information. Otherwise, the only instances that would require us to disclose customer information is to verify billing information with the customer's financial institution, to monitor for credit card fraud detection, under legal subpoena or other valid law enforcement requests
