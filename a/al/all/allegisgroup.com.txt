Allegis Group may disclose your personal information to any member of the Allegis Group of companies for use in accordance with this Privacy Statement. This includes our subsidiaries, affiliates and our ultimate holding company.
This sharing of personal information with Allegis Group affiliates may include combining the personal information gathered by certain Allegis Group websites with information independently gathered on other Allegis Group websites into one or more database(s) useable by Allegis Group, including all of its affiliates. Again, this combined information will only ever be used for the purposes disclosed within this Privacy Statement.
Sharing Your Personal Information with Third Parties
Companies in Allegis Group may use the information internationally in connection with processing requests by potential customers or potential employers of contract workers or temporary employees. Allegis Group may disclose personal information about you to potential employers (direct placements) or potential customers if you are a contract worker we are seeking to assign to a customer.
We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if we believe it necessary to do so. We also may disclose your personal information to third parties when we choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We use third party service providers to assist us in providing our website(s) and services, including to support us in areas such as recruiting and reviewing responses to job advertisements, managing résumé/CV data, IT platform management or support services, infrastructure and application services, marketing, data analytics, drug and background screening, payroll processing services, and health care benefits. In providing these services on behalf of the Allegis Group, it may be necessary for us to provide these third parties access to personal information.
We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide the services on our behalf, and under strict contractual terms that require them to maintain the security and confidentiality of any personal information to which they have access.
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Allegis Group decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Allegis Group’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
We may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Allegis Group’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
