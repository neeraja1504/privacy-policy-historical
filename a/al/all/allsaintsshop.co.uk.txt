All Saints take a great deal of care in ensuring that information which we obtain about you is treated appropriately and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We will not sell your personal information to any third parties.
We use the information that we collect about you to:
a) Process your order expeditiously and efficiently.
b) In order to enable the goods to be delivered to you we have to pass on your address to our third party couriers. If it is in our possession we will also pass on details of your telephone number in order to allow our couriers to contact you directly in the event of a query regarding delivery.
c) Contact you regarding forthcoming offers by email only.
We will not telephone you unless the telephone call relates to a particular order that you have made. Credit card and debit card details are checked and verified by a third party and goods are only dispatched once authorisation has been obtained.
We may use information concerning you for payment recovery or to investigate any possible fraud in the event that credit or debit card payments have been used in a fraudulent manner. Please note that we may be required to disclose information concerning you if requested to do so by the police.
If you would like to see a copy of the personal data that All Saints hold on you then please write to All Saints, Units C15 – C17, Jack’s Place, 6 Corbet Place, London E1 6NN for the attention of the Data Protection Manager. There is a £5 fee for this service to cover our administration costs.
