Alliance Games uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use and to pick out topics of interest to discussion board users Alliance Games will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form.

Special Note for Parents
The site you are visiting is one of the Alliance Games general audience sites.  All of our current sites fall into this category.  As these sites can reasonably be expected to have visitors who are under the age of 13 years old, they are governed by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a series of rules enacted under the enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Parents and guardians should instruct their children never to give out real names, telephone numbers, addresses, or any other identifying information over the Internet without first getting their permission.
We will not knowingly contact children under age 13 about promotions or for marketing purposes without a parent’s permission nor will we ask for more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity.  No information should be submitted or posted to our site by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.  If you are under 13 and you want to access some of the activities on the site which require registration, then you will need to complete and return a consent form (see the Parental Consent Form below).  If we determine that we are in receipt of personal information of a visitor under 13 years of age for whom we do not have a parental consent form on file, we will delete this information from the site.
