Affiliate Disclaimer
In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance. These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media (blogs, YouTube videos etc)know if the blogger/presenter/site owner is sponsored, endorsed or partnered with a different company. In blog terms, the readers need to know if the blogger is making money by sharing a link or product.
In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site: Any/all of the links on all-things-photography.com are affiliate links of which I receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.
What Are Affiliate Links?
Purchases are made on external company websites: When a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on all-things-photography.com to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly and not from all-things-photography.com. Amazon and/or other companies pay all-things-photography.com a small commission or other compensation for promoting their website or products through their affiliate program.
Prices are exactly the same for you if your purchase is through an affiliate link or non-affiliate link. You won't pay more by clicking the link but the small commission earned helps us to maintain this site.
