We have been successfully processing secure credit card transactions since 1997.
When we request personal information from you (such as name, address, phone number and credit card number) it is done on our secure servers. We use industry standard technology to protect confidential information - SSL (Secured Socket Layer) - an advanced encryption technology that makes personal information unreadable as it travels over the Internet. In addition, once your transaction is complete, your credit card number is deleted from our database.
We are so confident in our security, that we guarantee you'll pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at All About Jazz.
Federal law limits your liability for unauthorized charges to your account. The Fair Credit Billing Act states that your credit card company (creditor) cannot hold you liable for more than $50 in the unlikely event a fraudulent charge occurs on your account. If you encounter a fraudulent credit card charge at All About Jazz, don't worry, we'll pay the first $50. No credit card risk - Guaranteed.
