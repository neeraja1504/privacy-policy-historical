IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, "WE," "US," "ITS" AND "OUR" REFER TO All Biz Limited ("Allbiz"), AND "YOU" AND "YOUR" REFER TO YOU.

It may be possible for you to browse certain parts of the Resource without identification or revealing any information that enables us to directly identify you as an individual. However, you may lose anonymity once you give us information about you, and by doing so, you agree to the collection, transfer and storage of that information to our servers and to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
