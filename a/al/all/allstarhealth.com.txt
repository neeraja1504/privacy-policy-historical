Frequently Asked Questions
1. Shipping Options
More than 98% of orders placed before 3PM local time ship the same business day. Almost all remaining orders ship the following day. You will receive an email from us if there is an unforeseen delay that may cause your order to arrive later than expected. Please note that all transit times are listed in business days. This excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and most holidays. If your shipment is late and you think there is a problem with the delivery, we encourage you to contact us via email. We will investigate the inquiry and respond in a prompt manner.
Within the Contiguous 48 States: Standard shipping is just $5.95 per order; regardless of how many items you wish to purchase. Please note that YOU MAY ONLY SELECT THE DOMESTIC STANDARD OPTION IF YOU ARE SHIPPING TO AN ADDRESS THAT CAN ACCEPT SHIPMENTS FROM BOTH UPS AND THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. Domestic Standard shipments may be delivered by either of the two carriers and we cannot determine which of the two will ultimately deliver the package. Occasionally, UPS will deliver the package to the local post office and the post office will then deliver it to your door. Transit time is typically 1-5 business days. You will be provided with a tracking number via email as soon as your order is shipped.
You may choose to upgrade your shipping to Next-Day, 2-Day, or 3-Day delivery once you are ready to check out. All transit times are listed in business days. The additional shipping charges for upgraded air shipments will be calculated based on the weight of the products you purchase and the proximity to our shipping facility. To select a different shipping option, you will need to type in your delivery zip code and scroll down to the desired shipping option. Please note that if you live outside of the contiguous 48 states you must select "USPS Priority Mail" as your delivery option.
Hawaii, Alaska, and US Territories: If you live in Alaska, Hawaii, or a U.S. territory, your order must be sent via USPS Priority Mail. YOU MUST SELECT USPS PRIORITY MAIL AS YOUR SHIPPING OPTION OR YOUR ORDER WILL NOT BE PROCESSED. USPS Priority Mail usually arrives within 2-4 days, however, it is not guaranteed and it cannot be tracked until it is delivered. While we do our best to accommodate our customers in these areas, we cannot offer our standard $5.95 domestic flat-rate for these orders. Your actual shipping charges depend on distance and weight of the order and will be calculated on the shopping cart page..
Military Addresses: If you are stationed at a military address overseas, your order must be sent via USPS Priority Mail. YOU MUST SELECT PRIORITY MAIL AS YOUR SHIPPING OPTION OR YOUR ORDER WILL NOT BE PROCESSED. Priority Mail to overseas military addresses usually arrives within 7-20 business days, however, it is not guaranteed and cannot always be tracked. Actual shipping charges will be calculated on the shopping cart page and depend on location and weight of the order. Since the US Postal Service does not offer package tracking for most military addresses, we cannot issue refunds on lost shipments unless they are returned to us.
P.O. Boxes: If your delivery address is a United States P.O. Box, your order will be sent via USPS Priority Mail. YOU MUST SELECT USPS PRIORITY MAIL AS YOUR SHIPPING OPTION OR YOUR ORDER WILL NOT BE PROCESSED. Priority Mail usually arrives within 1-3 business days. Actual shipping charges will be calculated on the shopping cart page and depend on distance and weight of the order. Please note that because UPS cannot deliver to P.O. boxes, shipping rates may be more expensive. Having your order sent to a place that accepts both UPS and US Postal Service is recommended if you wish to keep your shipping costs low.
International: Shipping charges for each carrier will be displayed on your cart page once you select a ship-to country. We are currently shipping only to select countries. If the country you would like the products shipped to is not listed, your best option is to have them shipped to a friend or relative within the United States that can forward the package to you once they receive it. A complete list of valid countries is available in the scroll box on the shopping cart page.
We will write the actual value of your order on the customs form attached to the box. Any customs, import duties, or additional taxes must be paid by the recipient. AllStarHealth.com has no control over these charges.
We encourage you to call your customs office to find out the exact import taxes or duties you will need to pay before you place your order. Please note that some nutritional supplements may not be allowed into your country. AllStarHealth.com will not issue refunds for orders that are denied entry through customs. You are responsible for checking the customs regulations in your country before placing your order.
Please note that our currently posted processing time does not apply for International orders. Because of special regulations that apply only to International orders, you may experience a 1-3 day delay in processing your order. If you are using a credit card that was issued by a foreign bank, you may be required to fax or email credit card documentation after your order is placed. Please understand that we ask for this documentation as a security measure to insure your credit card security. You will only be asked to provide this information on your initial order.
2. Refunds and Returns
If you are not satisfied with a product you purchased, you may return the unused portion for a full refund of the purchase price within 30 days of purchase. The unused portion must contain at least 25% of the original portion of the product. Unfortunately, we cannot refund the original and return shipping charges. If you were shipped the wrong product in error, you may return the product at our expense for a full refund of the purchase price and shipping charges. You must call 800-875-0448 to get a Return Merchandise Authorization number (RMA) prior to shipping your return. We reserve the right to refuse RMA's if our return policy is being abused.
If you purchase nutrition bars that contain chocolate, they may melt during transit. Although this problem is rare, we suggest that you refrigerate all chocolate products as soon as you receive them to restore consistency. WE DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS ON MELTED PRODUCTS.
Our return policy is applicable to all products purchased at AllStarHealth.com with the exception of products manufactured by the following brands:
• Blistex

The phone number and web address of the appropriate manufacturer should be listed near the UPC code on the product.
We do not accept open returns of any product within our fragrance category. If the fragrance is unused and in its original packaging, you may return it to us within 30 days of purchase.
To ensure delivery of your order, we have chosen reputable carriers for all of our domestic orders. All of our domestic shipments are sent with delivery confirmation from either the US Postal Service or UPS. AllStarHealth.com is not responsible for undamaged merchandise once delivery has been confirmed by UPS or the US Postal Service. All mail or parcels that are lost after delivery will be the sole responsibility of the consumer and all claims for packages lost after delivery will have to be filed directly with UPS or the US Postal Service. Parcels that are either refused by the recipient or returned to us due to an incorrect or undeliverable address will be processed as returns. You will receive a refund for the purchase price of your order minus the shipping charges.
3. Tracking an Order
When your order is placed, you will receive an email with your order receipt. The email will include a link that you can use to check the current status of your order. If the shipping method used has a tracking number, the link will be updated to include the tracking number for your order once the order has been shipped. You will also receive a second email with your tracking information attached when your order is shipped. Unfortunately, tracking is usually not available for FPO or APO military address and we will not be able to provide you with tracking information.
4. Payment Methods
We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and checks. Checks must be received within 30 days of order and will be held until cleared.

8. About Us
AllStarHealth.com was founded way back in the 20th century by two brothers working out of their Mom and Dad's one car garage. What we now believe was a sophisticated and covert plot by Mom and Dad to regain access to their rightful indoor parking spot, ultimately led the two of them to join their offspring in an effort to graduate from a startup home business experiment to a "real" company. Their hard work paid off just a few short months later when the garage got packed up and moved into the first of what would end up being 6 facilities over the course of the next 20+ years.
As is the case with most family owned businesses, it was an adventurous roller-coaster of a ride. The proverbial blood, sweat, and tears are to be expected when four family members and first-time business owners decide to take on the Goliath's of the industry like Amazon and GNC. But two decades later, the dream lives on. The previously mentioned 300 square foot garage has now grown to over 250,000 square feet of temperature controlled warehouse and office space with East and West Coast locations to insure your orders get to you quickly and efficiently no matter where in the world you call home. The initial 100 products that were available when the site was first launched has now grown to over 25,000 products from over 300 reputable manufacturers to insure you never have to look anywhere else to find what you need to keep you feeling healthy every day. And while the 4 family members and 3 initial employees still proudly call AllStarHealth.com their employer (all with slightly better titles than "order-packer" now), our proudest achievement has been the honor of growing our staff by providing well-paying, stable jobs to hundreds of families within our local community. We are still very much family owned and operated; the family just feels a whole lot bigger now.
We have never lost sight of how we got here… YOU! Without loyal customers like you, we would probably all go back to living in that house with the one car garage that started this all (if you’re wondering; Yes – Mom and Dad still live in that same house… and they got their parking spot back!). We will never forget how important it is to keep you happy, so we have made a commitment to offering you the best service and selection in the Industry. And most importantly, we are committed to keeping our prices low so that you don’t have to make compromises when it comes to your health. If you ever find a price lower than ours, tell us about it and we will beat it! We have real people, not machines, taking your phone calls. We answer emails 7 days per week. And needless to say, the web site is up 24/7. Whatever it takes, we are here to serve you. It's what we do!
