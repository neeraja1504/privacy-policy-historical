This statement will also tell you how you can verify the accuracy of your personal data submitted to Allscripts through our websites via computers, smart phones and other mobile devices, and how you can request that we delete or update your personal data. We have developed our privacy policy from industry guidelines and standards, and national laws and requirements. This Privacy Statement highlights our strong commitment to protect your privacy.

Throughout this Privacy Statement, “Allscripts” refers to Allscripts Healthcare, LLC, including its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (also referred to as “we” and “us”).

3. Information We Collect
Allscripts’ primary goal in collecting personal data from you is to give you a meaningful, enjoyable and customized experience while using our websites and to allow us to develop new products and services that are relevant to visitors like you. Personal data also allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your online experience smooth and efficient.
Personal Data
To provide access to certain information on our websites, we need to collect certain personal data identifying who you are, your e-mail address and your mailing address. Visitors may also be asked to select a user ID and password. If you opt not to provide your personal data, you can still access our websites; however, you may be unable to gain access to certain information.
Aggregate and Statistical Data
Allscripts may collect certain aggregate data called web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, mobile device information if applicable, etc.) and use cookies when you visit sites. For instance, when you visit one of our sites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal data, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer, Mozilla), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider. Neither the web log information nor cookies collect any personal data. They do not contain personal data, such as your name or e-mail address, and in no way are used to identify our users. You can find out more about our cookies here.
4. Sensitive Information
We will not collect sensitive information through our websites unless it is required. We ask that you not send us or share any sensitive Personal Data (e.g., government-issued or financial account numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, genetic, or biometric data, criminal background or trade union membership) unless we specifically request this information.
5. Children's Information
Allscripts’ website is not directed to minors. If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected Personal Data of a minor through our website without appropriate consent, please notify us as detailed in our Contact Information section below so that we may immediately delete the information from our servers and make any other necessary corrections.
6. How We Use Your Information
Personal Data
We use personal data about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze site usage; to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize our sites' content, layout and services. We may also use your personal data to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, new services and promotions. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our visitors' needs. Allscripts may combine non-personal data collected automatically (e.g., through web log data) with your previously submitted personal data.
Aggregate and Statistical Data
Allscripts uses web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) to help us design our website, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be used if necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.
7. Legal Basis of Processing
We collect and process (i.e. use) personal data about you where we have lawful bases. In a majority of the cases, processing will be justified on the basis of:
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent.
When collecting your personal data, we will make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.
Contractual obligations
In certain circumstances, we need customers’ personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
8. How We Protect Your Information
Allscripts is committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or alteration. Vendors, contractors, or partners of Allscripts who have access to your personal data in connection with providing services for Allscripts are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for us. When necessary, we use secure connections on our web sites to protect information during its transmission. Access to your personal data is password-protected and we regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
9. How Long Will We Retain Your Personal Data?
Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we’ll only keep it for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymized, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.
10. How We May Share Your Data
Except as stated below, we will not share, trade or sell personal data of our visitors for use by any business. However, aggregated and statistical data from our visitors may be shared with our partners in a manner that does not identify you personally. For example, we may let a partner know that approximately "75% of our visitors use high speed connections or access our site after 7pm." We may share personal data with service providers or contractors that perform services for us and act at our direction. The services they provide may include such activities as direct mailing, fulfillment services, or e-mail campaigns. When you have agreed to receive such services, we also may share personal data with our business partners that provide joint offerings with us. When we do so, such business partners are restricted in using your data to provide the services you’ve agreed to.
Allscripts may share your personal data with any person or company that acquires Allscripts’ business or any portion of the Allscripts business to which your personal data relates. Allscripts will ensure that any person or company to which your personal data is transferred agrees to abide by the same privacy obligations as Allscripts. Allscripts also reserves the right to share personal data to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law. We may also share personal data in responding to requests from law enforcement officials, government bodies or judicial authorities to address matters of personal or public safety, national security, litigation, investigations (including data security incident investigations), and other legal matters where the data is pertinent.
