This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 2014.
This Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles. We are dedicated to treating your personal information with care and respect.
This Privacy Policy applies to our Sites (defined below) and to our Mobile Apps or Apps (defined below) provided by Fuel Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries in the U.S. ( collectively , "Fuel Industries" , "we" , "our" , or "us" ). This Privacy Policy governs your use of our Sites and Apps, regardless of how you access or use them.

Each time you access and/or use the Sites or Apps, you agree to be bound by and comply with all of the terms of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, do not use the Sites or Apps if you do not agree to all of the terms of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect about you when you use the Sites or Apps, how the information will be used, with whom we share your information, and how you can control the collection, use and sharing of your information or update your information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
Your use of the Sites and Apps are also governed by our Terms of Use into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.
Notice to Parents and Legal Guardians
Fuel Industries and this Privacy Policy adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit ("CARU") of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in our Sites, online services and Apps directed to children under 13. Wherever we refer to "children" or a "child" in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under 13. Whenever we refer to "kids," we mean generally users who are underage minors.
Our Sites and Apps offer various services directed at kids and their families, and therefore may involve the collection of children’s personal information. Upon registration, we ask users to provide a username and password, age, and a parent’s email address. We will use a parent’s email address for the purpose of providing a user’s parent with notice of information relating to this Privacy Policy and to obtain consent where required; and we will not use the parent’s email address for marketing purposes, unless the parent has consented to receiving marketing information (such as newsletters) from us.
Consent from a child’s parent or legal guardian is required for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a child, and we describe below how and when we will seek parental consent. We also explain below the type of information we collect, how we use and share the information we collect, and your ability to review, edit and delete personal information collected by us. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to allow the child the ability to participate in an activity or to use our services offered through the Sites or Apps, and to ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s or legal guardian’s consent for that collection. Please also help us protect your children's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information (like their full name, email address, home address, telephone number, etc.) without your permission.
Notice to Kids
We strongly encourage all kids to get parental permission to access or use our Sites and Apps. If you are under 13, you are required to get your parent's or legal guardian's permission before giving out your contact information, like email address or phone number, or any other personal information, to us or to anyone else.

Children Under the Age of 13
We take many special precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. Through our Sites and Apps intended for use by children, we do not collect personal information (like first and last name, email address, phone number or home address, and persistent identifiers such as an IP address) from children without verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law. We also take steps to prevent children from posting or publicly disclosing personal contact information.
When a child seeks to register with us through our Sites or Apps, we collect the following information: age, username, password and parent's email address (to be used for obtaining consent, as set forth above in the section "Notice to Parents and Legal Guardians").
In addition, we may ask all users to voluntarily provide personal information and we may collect other information (like IP address, mobile device UDID/device identifier, operating system, etc.) automatically and use technology like cookies to provide functionality and support our operations. Please refer to the section "What Information is Collected?" below for a further explanation of the type of information we collect from all users, including children. In instances where we collect information from a child, we do not ask for more personal information than is necessary for a child to participate in an activity.
Verifiable Parental Consent
In circumstances where we seek parental consent, we will send an email to the parent or legal guardian of a child to and provide the applicable parent or legal guardian with a "Direct Notice" as required under COPPA, notifying the type of personal information that may be collected from the child and how such information may be used and/or disclosed by us, and obtain verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian. The Direct Notice will provide directions that the parent is required to follow in order to provide us with consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of the child’s personal information, and instructions on how the parent can revoke such consent.
Specifically, Direct Notice to the parent or legal guardian will contain a link to this Privacy Policy and explain the following: (i) that we have obtained the parent’s email address in order to obtain the parent’s consent; (ii) the purposes for which we are seeking to collect personal information from the parent’s child; (iii) that the parent’s consent is required for the child’s use of our Sites or Apps, and that we will not collect, use or disclose any personal information from the child if the parent does not provide such consent; (iv) the potential items of personal information we intend to collect from the child if the parent provides consent; (v) how the parent can provide verifiable consent to collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information; and (vi) that we will delete the parent’s email address from our records if the parent does not provide consent within a reasonable time from the date the notice was sent.
A parent or legal guardian may consent to our use of a child’s personal information without also consenting to the disclosure of the child’s personal information to third parties other than our Service Providers. You may contact us at customersupport@fuelindustries.com to request that we do not disclose the use of your child’s personal information to these third parties, or to update or delete your child’s information.
In the event that we change our policy with respect to the collection of personal information from children, or if new features, contests or sweepstakes which a child wishes to use or participate in require the provision of personal information, their parent or guardian will be notified and will be required to give their consent to the collection and use of this information and/or be given the option to opt out of participation.
