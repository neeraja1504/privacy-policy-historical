What Information do we collect from children who are under 13 years of age?
All Science Fair Projects generally limits its collection of information from kids to basic information such as email addresses, names and level of education. This information is collected so that we are better able to provide services (such as newsletters) or certain promotions or other activities to them. We will request that the child provide his/her personal details, without having to first seek your permission, if the offered activity involves a one-off communication with your child. On the other hand, if the activity involves regular communication with your child (such as for a newsletter, contests or features that require a login), we will require your child to provide us with your name and e-mail address. All Science Fair Projects will use your details to then send you an e-mail, informing you of your child's request to participate. Your child will not be entered into the activity until you are given the opportunity to choose not to allow him or her to continue. If we do not receive a response from you, your consent will be assumed.
What do we do with the information?
We will only use information that we have collected from your child who is under 13 years of age, in connection with the stated purpose for which the information was collected.
If you have any questions at any time, please email us at info@all-science-fair-projects.com
