You may also perform some transactions on the web site.  This Privacy Statement applies to users of Allstate.com, regardless of whether the user is an Allstate customer.  In addition, as an Internet user, you should be aware of the following . . . .
What are cookies and how are they used?
Do you log my activity on your site?
Will I receive promotional e-mails from Allstate?
During the period you are logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or reviewing our site.
As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer’s hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided us with such information (over the Internet or otherwise) or set up preferences in your browser to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address or other personal information. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions.

If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information.
What security procedures do we use to guard against the loss, misuse, alteration, or theft of information while that information is being submitted to Allstate over the Internet?
We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, secure servers and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit.
To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information that you submit to us (other than via an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information before and during its transmission through the Internet. We only allow information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can be completed but at a lower level of security.
E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt e-mail messages. E-mail messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.
We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission of any personal or financial information via e-mail. Please keep in mind that transmitting information via e-mail over the Internet is never completely secure and thus any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or disclosed by others. If you are concerned about the security of your communication, we encourage you to send your correspondence through the postal service or use the telephone to speak directly to us.  We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages.
What can you do as a customer to help maintain the security of information when accessing Allstate over the Internet?

Make sure others are not watching you enter your User ID, PIN or password on your keyboard when using the Customer Care Center or when using other protected areas of Allstate.com.
Do not leave your computer unattended while logged onto our Customer Care Center or other protected areas of Allstate.com.
