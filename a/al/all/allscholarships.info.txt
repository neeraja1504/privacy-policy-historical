Privacy Policy – AllScholarships
Your privacy is very important to us. At AllScholarships we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.
It is allScholarship’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
Website Visitors
Like most websites, AllScholarships collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use this website.
We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. AllScholarships only discloses logged in user and commenters IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to websites choose to interact with us in ways that require AllScholarships to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that AllScholarships gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive AllScholarships updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, AllScholarships collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with AllScholarships. AllScholarships does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
AllScholarships may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors. For instance, we may monitor the most popular pages on the site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. We may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, personally-identifying information other than as described below will not be disclosed.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using AllScholarships’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
