2. Use of Information
The information you supply to Dual City Media enables us to provide the college search and matching services which you select by matching your background to the admission requirements and/or preferred student backgrounds of colleges and universities. Participating colleges and universities may search the non-personally identifiable information of users (such as grade point averages or class standing, but not names or addresses) in order to decide which users they are interested in having apply for admission. Dual City Media will also recommend certain colleges and universities to students, and we will use a similar methodology to select which students should be informed of those opportunities. Under no circumstances will we share any of your personally identifiable information with colleges or universities without your consent. When a student appears to be a viable candidate for admission, a notice will be placed in your message in-box in the college center on our website, and we will send you an email that may contain a link to your message in-box. Once you have reviewed the notice in your message in-box, you may give us permission to release your contact information to such college or university so that they may directly contact you.
In addition, Dual City Media uses your information in order to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience. Dual City Media uses various methods to recognize you, including requesting your e-mail address and password before accessing our site. Once Dual City Media recognizes you, pages, advertisements, including advertisements and offers in your college center, and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most.
