Privacy Policy
NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. NO RESEARCH PARTICIPATION REQUIRED.
All Day Giveaways/AllDayGiveaways.com (“we,” “us,” “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on this site ("Site") and how such information may be used and/or shared with others.
YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE USE IT. This Site collects the following kinds of information: (1) information that personally identifies you (such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address); (2) information that identifies your interests for “giveaway matching” including past giveaway participation history (3) information that does not personally identify you (such as the number of users who log on to the Site on a daily basis); As a general policy, no personally identifiable information is automatically collected from your visit to this Site. AllDayGiveaways.com only collects and retains personal information that you provide to us voluntarily in exchange for participation in giveaways. In certain circumstances, you may be asked on a voluntary basis to provide us with some personally identifiable information about yourself in order to use specific features on the Site, such as giveaways, offers, contests, surveys and other promotions. Such information may include contact information, and other information as we may require. The personally identifiable information you submit will be used to carry out your requests and respond to your inquiries. To accomplish this, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as giveaway publishers or those that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that deliver merchandise, participate in our promotions, publish giveaways, administer our promotions, provide marketing or promotional assistance, analyze data or provide customer service. In that case, such information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform their functions. Your personally identifiable information may also be used by us or shared with our publishers and affiliates to provide you with product information, and promotional and other offers. We may also use your information as otherwise disclosed at the point where such information is collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature of the Site. Except as provided herein, your personally identifiable information will not be supplied to any third parties without prior approval from you. Participation in any available giveaway consents approval. As a condition for free ballots in any giveaway on the site, your information will be provided to our publisher giveaways for use in marketing messages. Your information will remain on the site and cannot be exported by the publisher. At any date after receiving a marketing message from a giveaway publisher, you can “unsubscribe” from that particular publisher and all mailings will cease. From time to time, we may collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the standard operation of our servers. Such information can include the type of browser being used, the operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and the number of users that visit a specific page on the Site and the character and duration of such visits. This information may be used to help analyze site traffic and improve our services. We may also aggregate such information to create statistical data and share it with potential advertisers, partners, affiliates and other third parties. At no point, however, will the aggregated information personally identify you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non- personally identifiable information if we are required to do so or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law; (c) comply with legal process served on us; (d) protect or defend the legal rights or property of All Day Giveaways, its parent company Flip Pocket and its affiliates, this Site, or its users; or (e) in an emergency to protect the welfare of our users or the general public. We may also transfer personally identifiable information to another entity in the event of certain corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or corporate division or other fundamental corporate change.
CHILDREN UNDER 13 This Site is operated in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and is not intended to collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should not provide any personally identifiable information on the Site without the knowledge and permission of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such information would like the information deleted from our records, he or she should contact us at the e-mail address or phone number listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files. IP ADDRESS An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. Web servers, the big computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, reporting aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track Site usage. When visitors request pages from the Site, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's policies or to protect our service, customers, the Site, or others.
