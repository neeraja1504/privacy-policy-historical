By processing, we mean everything we can do with this data such as collecting, recording, storing, adjusting, organising, using, disclosing, transferring or deleting. For more information about the way we use your personal data, please refer to Section 4 (“What we do with your personal data”).
You share personal information with us, for example when you: visit our website, complete a(n) (online) (application) form, sign a contract, make a payment or alternatively use our payment services, or contact us through one of our channels.
We also use data that is legally available from public sources such as commercial registers, debtor registers and the media, or data that is legitimately provided by other companies within Allied Wallet or by third parties.
3. Sensitive data
We do not record sensitive data relating to your health, ethnicity, religious or political beliefs unless it is strictly necessary. When we do it is limited to specific circumstances, for example if you as a customer of an Allied Wallet merchant make a payment for a membership fee to a political party or religious organisation.
4. What we do with your personal data
We only use your personal data for legitimate business reasons. This includes:
Administration. When you open a merchant account we are legally obliged to collect personal data that verifies your identity (such as a copy of your ID card or passport) and to assess whether we can accept you or your company as a customer. We also need to know your address or phone number to contact you.
Managing customer relationships. We may ask you for feedback about our products and services and share this with certain members of our staff to improve our offering. We might also use notes from conversations we have with you online, by telephone or in person to customise products and services for you.
Credit risk. To assess the financial position of your company we apply specific risk models that may involve the use of personal data.
Personalised marketing. We may send you letters, emails, or text messages offering you a product or service based on your personal circumstances, or show you such an offer when you log in to our website or mobile apps. You may unsubscribe from such personalised offers. You have the right, not to consent or to object to personalised direct marketing or commercial activities, including profiling related to these activities.
Providing you with the best-suited products and services. When you visit our website, call our customer service centre or visit a branch, we gather information about you. We analyse this information to identify your potential needs and assess the suitability of products or services. For example, we may suggest investment opportunities suited to your profile. We analyse your payment behaviour, such as large amounts entering or leaving your account. We assess your needs in relation to key moments when a specific financial product or service may be relevant for you, such as starting your first job or buying a home. We assess your interests based on simulations you participate in on our website.
Improving and developing products and services: Analysing how you use our products and services helps us understand more about you and shows us where we can improve. For instance, when you open a merchant account, we measure the time it takes until your first transaction to understand how quickly you are able to use your merchant account.
We analyse data on transactions between you and our corporate customers (merchants) to offer information services. When Allied Wallet processes personal data for this purpose, aggregated data may be made available to the Allied Wallet merchant (webshop/onlineFF retailer). This merchant cannot identify you from these aggregated data.
We analyse the results of our marketing activities to measure their effectiveness and the relevance of our campaigns.
Preventing and detecting fraud and data security: We have a duty to protect your personal data and to prevent, detect and contain data breaches. This includes information we are obliged to collect about you, for example to comply with regulations against money laundering, terrorism financing and tax fraud. We may process your personal information to protect you and your assets from fraudulent activities, for example if you are the victim of identity theft, if your personal data was disclosed, or if you are hacked.
We may use certain information about you for profiling (e.g. name, account number, age, nationality, IP address, etc.) to quickly and efficiently detect a particular crime and the person behind it.
Our merchants (webshops/online retailers) may use contact and security data to secure transactions and communications made via remote channels.
Internal and external reporting: We process your data for our payment operations and to help our management make better decisions about our operations and services. To comply with a range of legal obligations and statutory requirements (anti-money laundering legislation and tax legislation, for example).
Data that we process for any other reason is anonymised or we remove as much of the personal information as possible
5. Who we share your data with and why
Whenever we share personal data internally or with third parties in other countries, we ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect it. For this, Allied Wallet relies on: • EU Model clauses, which are standardised contractual clauses used in agreements with service providers to ensure personal data transferred outside of the European Economic Area complies with EU data protection law. • Privacy Shield framework that protects personal data transferred to the United States.
To be able to offer you the best possible services and remain competitive in our business, we share certain data both internally as well as outside of Allied Wallet. This includes:
