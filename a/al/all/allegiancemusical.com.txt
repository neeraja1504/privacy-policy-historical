Privacy Policy - Allegiance
Privacy Policy and Legal Notice
We have created this Privacy Policy and Legal Notice in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Allegiance–A New Musical (www.allegiancemusical.com) (this “website”). All references to “we” or “us” in this Privacy Policy and Legal Notice refers to Allegiance Broadway LLC or its managers, predecessors or successors, the production company responsible for producing “Allegiance–A New Musical”.
Information Collected and How We Use It
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and similar information.
This website also may use unique identifiers to confirm data, such as your geographical location, and we use such data in the aggregate to run internal analyses to improve upon your user experience.
Through surveys and newsletter registration, this website may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or general financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new content, for surveys and newsletters, via email. Financial information related to income level that is collected is used primari for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
In addition, we may employ outside agents, meaning other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail, conducting sweepstakes and other promotional activities, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. These agents have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. Other than such outside agents, suppliers and vendors, we keep all of your personal information private and will not share it with any third party, unless you have authorized us to or we are legally required to do so. We may also release personal information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of ourselves, our clients, our users, or others. Of course, we may disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
Contests
We may run contests on this website in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name, address and/or email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user’s contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests.
We generally would host our own contest or sweepstakes and, in such instance, all information that is collected by us would be used only by us subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Legal Notice or as otherwise provided in any applicable contest or sweepstakes rules.  In certain instances, a third party may host the contest or sweepstakes and all collected information would then be shared with us and that third party and otherwise used by us subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Legal Notice or as otherwise provided in any applicable contest or sweepstakes rules.
In connection with the contests, we may also share contact information with third parties for shipping and prize fulfillment purposes. In our contest registration, we give visitors the opportunity to sign up for this website’s newsletter. However, visitors may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the newsletter.
Interactive Programs
We may run interactive programs on this website such as games, group events, promotions, and fan club activities in which we ask visitors for contact information similar to what we ask for in contests.  As with contests, the information is used to contest the program participants when necessary.  We may hold our own programs or elect to utilize a third party to host the program, in which case all information would then be share by us and that third party.  As with contests, visitors may elect to opt-out of receiving our mailings or newsletters.
