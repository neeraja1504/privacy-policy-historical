How we market to you.
We market to you via e-mail, phone and regular mail in the course of our business to provide the products/services related to your requests on our website.  Our marketing to you is personalized, professional, and if at any time you wish to stop any part of our assisting with your event request or serving you as a vendor, please visit our help section
How we protect your personal information
When you send payments to us we use the industry standard SSL encryption for receiving credit card numbers and payment information.  That information stays on our web server for about 30 seconds.  No credit card data is stored on our web server in a database for security reasons.  All data is transmitted to our offices behind our firewalls and stored in password protected databases. Only accounting personnel and senior level staff can see your credit card numbers. ALL other staff of a lower security level can only view the last 4 digits of your card #.  Old card data not being used is purged from the system after 1 year.  Credit card information is only used for purchasing products/services through our web site.
This site uses a tool which collects your requests for pages and passes elements of them to search engines to assist them in indexing this site. We control the configuration of the tool and are responsible for any information sent to the search engines
