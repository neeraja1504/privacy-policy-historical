We will not share your information with third parties to directly market their products to you.

We may also disclose your information to a third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of AlphaGraphics, or its subsidiaries or divisions. Any third party to which AlphaGraphics transfers or sells the System or related assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.
Behavioral Advertising
We may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to advertise to our users online. These third-party vendors may display AlphaGraphics advertisements on other websites based on your internet usage. More specifically, these vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytic cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site or another site affiliated with AlphaGraphics products or services. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies is not linked to any personally identifiable information (name, address, email address, or phone number) we collect or you provide on the website. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by using Google’s Ads Settings.
Security
We maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards for all user information collected in our System. When our System requests sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”).
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information offline. We take measures to restrict all of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Please note, however, that information disclosed online is never 100% secure and that protection of passwords and other information controlled by you is your responsibility.
Correcting, Updating and Limiting Personal Information
By providing information to us or using our System, you are consenting to our use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
While we work hard to use and disclose our users’ personal information only for the purposes identified above, you can choose not to provide personal information or to limit or update the personal information obtained by us as follows:
You may have your contact information updated or removed from our marketing lists by following the instructions listed at the bottom of the e-mail received from us or by emailing us at marketing@alphagraphics.com;
You may limit the collection of “cookies” through your browser settings. However, this may disable our ability to provide you with the most relevant products or information regarding the System; and
You may limit the ability of Google Analytics to track your online activity, as outlined in the “Behavioral Advertising” section.
