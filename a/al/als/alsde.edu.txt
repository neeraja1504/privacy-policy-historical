ALSDE: Privacy Policy
We want to be very clear: We prohibit commercial marketing of visitor information and the disclosure of personal information without prior consent of the visitor. We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, such as an email address. We use your email address to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our web site, or to forward email to another agency for appropriate action.
Web sites developed by the State of Alabama may use cookies to carry user information from one page to another. An example is a search criterion. This information is not stored on our server but on your workstation. We do not track this information on our server. The cookies we use are set to expire at the end of your browser session. This means that when you close your browser they are deleted.
Our server tracks statistical information (through the use of server logs) to help agencies hosted on our servers analyze the use of their sites. We collect and store only the following information about your visit:
the name of the domain from which you access the Internet;
the date and time you access our site;
and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.
We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.
Please refer to individual Alabama State Agency Web Sites for their Privacy Policies, which may differ from the one displayed here.
