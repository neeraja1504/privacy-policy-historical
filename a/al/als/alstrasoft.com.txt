Privacy Policy - AlstraSoft PHP Clone Script Provider
What personally identifiable information is collected from you
AlstraSoft collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.
Some personal information is gathered when you register for some of the demos of AlstraSoft software. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to AlstraSoft - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the demo programs.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times when using some features of AlstarSoft software demos. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within this web site includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

Who is collecting your information
With whom your information may be shared
As a general rule, AlstraSoft will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.
AlstraSoft may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Service of the AlstraSoft or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of the AlstraSoft, other users of the AlstraSoft, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information
How AlstraSoft protects children's privacy
AlstraSoft is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. AlstraSoft does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, AlstraSoft will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.
As a result of the new Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States, we are required to prohibit children under 13 who reside in the U.S. from posting ads or using any of the other features of our site that require them to submit information via forms. This is due to the onerous reporting and verification requirements that this new law places on web sites that allow children under 13 to submit information via forms. Since we do not have the large, dedicated staff that would be necessary to comply with these requirements, our only option in order to remain in compliance with the law is to prohibit all children under 13 who reside in the U.S. from posting any information via forms on our web site. Therefore, children under 13 who reside in the U.S. should not submit any information via forms on our web site, and if you submit such information, you warrant that you are either over the age of 13 or not located in the U.S. and thus not subject to COPPA.
What else you should know about your online privacy
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online through the use of our software demos. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
