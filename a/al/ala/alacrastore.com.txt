All personally identifiable information ("PII") of Users (including name, e-mail address, zip code, occupation, expected uses of information obtained from the Alacra Store is collected with the knowledge of Alacra Store Users via the website's order and registration forms only.

Alacra will not rent, sell, or otherwise disclose your PII with other people or companies except under the following circumstances:
We may disclose your PII to other companies (e.g., data processors or fulfillment companies) that work on behalf of Alacra (including, if you provide us with your credit card information, credit card companies). These companies may also use your PII to help Alacra communicate with you about offers in which you may have expressed an interest. However, these companies do not have any right to use any of your PII that they receive from Alacra on their own behalf and they will be under an obligation to keep your personal information confidential.
We may disclose your PII in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We may disclose your PII in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Alacra's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
We may disclose or transfer your PII if Alacra is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Alacra will notify you before your PII is so disclosed or transferred if it becomes subject to a significantly different privacy policy.
Alacra currently operates from offices in the United States and the United Kingdom, but may operate from additional offices worldwide in the future. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data protection are adhered to in all Alacra offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above.
User choices

Cookies

A cookie subsequently allows the User to move quickly and easily around the site by keeping a record of their activities during that visit and/or previous visits. Cookies in use at the Alacra Store are not associated with any PII about the User.
Cookies can be deleted from a PC's hard drive at any time by the User, but such deletion may result in User needing to re-login to use the Alacra Store.
