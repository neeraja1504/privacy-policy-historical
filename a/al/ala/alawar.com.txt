Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
Alawar operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission.
Alawar takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After Personal information reaches Alawar it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Alawar. Because laws applicable to Personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Website covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and also in other countries where Alawar and its service providers conduct business. By providing information to Alawar you consent to the storage of your Personal information in these locations. All Alawar employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
Alawar does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants, web hosting, data management and storage service providers, marketing, advertising companies for delivery targeted advertisements, business partners providing services, products that you have requested or may be of interest to you that act as independent contractors on behalf of Alawar. These parties are contractually prohibited from processing Personal information for any purpose other than for performing legitimate contractual obligations or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
We do provide non-personal information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated, anonymized basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of Personal information to entities outside of the Alawar's affiliates for their use without your approval.
Alawar may disclose your Personal information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Alawar may also disclose Personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of use, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
In the event that all or substantially all of Alawar's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Alawar may transfer Personal information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your Personal information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Choices and Rights available to you
You can always choose whether or not to disclose Personal information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Alawar Website.

We will retain anonymous information after your account has been closed.
Alawar is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.
You may access and correct your Personal information and privacy preferences, opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any Personal information, by writing at privacy@alawar.com or regular mail at Alawar Entertainment, Inc. 244 Fifth Avenue, Suite F164 New York, N.Y. 10001.

Alawar reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.
Where processing of your Personal information is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal information unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.
