Gemalto's Privacy Policy
​​Effective date: 30 June, 2014
Introduction
We have tried to write this privacy policy in an easy to read manner doing our best to move away from legalese dense prose that could be a challenge to understand. If you have any questions or if you believe that this policy can be improved, do not hesitate to contact us via e-mail at: privacy@gemalto.com.
In this policy,
“user” or “you” means any person using the Service, whether by browsing our websites or using our mobile apps, purchasing products, subscribing to our Newsletter, to “Get in touch with us”, or participating in any other activities available through the Service.
Gemalto or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns means Gemalto S.A.
First note that since the registrant of the domain name is Gemalto S.A. a company organized under the law of France, this Privacy Policy is based on the laws and regulations of France.

We may also collect information about the device (PC, MAC, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) you are using to connect to the On-Line Service. Such information may include the type of device, the operating system you are using, device settings, and unique device identifiers. The collection of this information depends on the device you are using and its settings.
