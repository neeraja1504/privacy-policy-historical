_ Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)_
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in the “Information We Collect” heading above and this section will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process the personal information collected from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If this is the case, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to conduct our business and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our other legitimate interests, for instance, responding to your queries, improving our services or for the purpose of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, or object to the use of your personal information on these grounds, please email us at privacy@alfresco.com using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
Sharing Information
We may share and disclose your personal information to third parties under any of the following circumstances:
As may be required for internal purposes (e.g. to any member of our group including our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries);
As may be required to fulfill orders, to conduct billing/credit card processing, to provide services to and for our customers, and for email housing (as a consequence of uses already described in this Privacy Statement);
As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency, law enforcement, or national security action, or to prevent fraud) where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
To make marketing messages more relevant to you;
For analysis and filtering of messages and content for spam;
For research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is used to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and is not used to contact the subjects of the report); and
In the context of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or divestiture (pursuant to a pledge of confidentiality under which the recipient agrees to use the information for no purpose other than carrying out the transaction).
We are responsible for and maintain contracts with third parties restricting their access, use, and disclosure of personal information in compliance with our legal obligations, and we may be liable if they fail to meet those contractual obligations.
How We Protect Information
We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative measures to protect any personal information we process about you with measures being designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.  Personal information you provide to us is stored on secure servers operated by us or our third-party providers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. In addition, we enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal information.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use robust procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

We may also send you e-mails with information and / or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, in accordance with your marketing preferences.

(Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.)
Where Information Is Stored
Personal information collected from you may be transferred and stored outside the European Economic Area (" EEA "). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, a member of our group, or for one of our suppliers. Our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate in countries located in the EEA (including without limitation the United Kingdom, Germany and France), the United States, and Australia. Such staff or suppliers may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of CRM services, marketing campaigns, support and hosting services on our behalf.
Your information is stored on our servers in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and potentially in other countries whose data protection laws may be different to the laws in your country. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement wherever it is processed.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
EU and Swiss Privacy Shield
Alfresco adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce here.  Our certification is available here and applies to the personal data we receive from EU and Swiss visitors and users of the sites and services and from our customers about EU and Swiss individuals through the sites or services.
European Union and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy practices should first contact Alfresco at privacy@alfresco.com. Alfresco commits to respond to complaints of EU and Swiss individuals about our collection and/or processing of their personal information within 45 days.
If you do not receive acknowledgment of your complaint within 45 days of receipt from us or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you may bring a complaint to the EU Data Protection Authorities or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner through the United States Council for International Business (USCIB) free of charge.  You can learn more at http://www.uscib.org.  In limited situations, if neither Alfresco nor the USCIB resolves your complaint, you may have the opportunity to engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.  Alfresco is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Public Forums Reminder
The sites often make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Children’s Online Privacy
Note: You must be 16 years or older to register as a Member or use the Alfresco web-site. We do not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 16 to become registered members of our sites or buy products and services on our sites. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 16.
In the event that we ever decide to expand our intended site audience to include children under the age of 16, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of applicable law (including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 16. In addition, we will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
