Personal Information
Alfred Angelo generally collects personal information only with your knowledge and consent. Alfred Angelo collects information that you provide to us online, through completion of registration and other forms in our retail stores, or through other means.  Personal information may include your name, address, email address, wedding date and phone number, and we may request and you may choose to supply other information such as age, gender, credit card or other personal information (collectively "personal information.") Alfred Angelo may collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of our products and services that we offer.  Alfred Angelo may also record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page or pages you request.  For example:
- If you join our registry or request an appointment through the Service, we will collect your first and last name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number, specific bridal party and wedding information, and other preferences and demographic information you provide.
- If you make a purchase through the Service, we will ask you to register with us, and we will also ask you for your credit card number, a shipping address and a telephone number for that shipping address, and for any additional information that may be required to personalize the product you purchase.
- If you contact our customer service, we will ask you for your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, order number and such other information as you wish to submit to us to allow us to assist you.

Please note that registration is required to create “My Favorites,” submit a story, or use certain other features of the Service.
Social Networks : If you are a member of Facebook or another social network or service, and you use functionality available through the Service or otherwise authorize us to associate your Service account with that network or service, both we and the network or service will gather information about your behavior on the Service, and may associate that information with personal information we and the network or service already have about you. Public Conduct : __ If you engage in behavior at or through the Service that is intended to be viewed by other users (collectively, "Public Conduct"), such as participating in forums, message boards and chat rooms; using your Facebook page, Twitter® account or other functionality available through the Service to share product preferences, comment on products and other content; or posting stories about your wedding, we and others may collect information about you as a result of your Public Conduct, and all such information will be publicly available to anyone visiting or using the Service. Automatic Gathering of Information : We and other companies and individuals we select to provide us with goods and services (each, a "Service Provider") collect non-identifying information about your visit to or use of the Service, your Web browsing movements across the Internet (not just on the Service), and your interaction with our advertisements at the Service and elsewhere. For example, we may keep track of how many of our advertisements you saw before visiting the Service, how you were directed to the Service, how you navigate around the Service, which products you browse, as well as your purchasing activities through the Service.
To do this, we and our Service Providers use technology (e.g., cookies, action tags, Web beacons, and GIF tags), placed at various sections within the Service and in our advertisements delivered by e-mail or served during your Web browsing session. Some of this technology may be disabled by changing your Web browser settings. Please consult the documentation for your Web browser on how to manage the information gathering and storage aspects of this technology on your computer. We and our Service Providers do not collect any personal information through the use of this technology.
If you use the mobile application portion of the Service, we and our Service Providers may also use various technology (e.g., anonymous identifiers, flash cookies, HTML5 software, local storage, and mini-databases) to track your Web browsing movements at the Service and across the Internet, and may store such information on your mobile device. Many mobile devices have this technology pre-loaded or incorporated in the Web browser, or the technology may be included in the mobile application you download and use on your device. Please consult your device documentation on how to manage the information gathering and storage aspects of this technology. We and our Service Providers do not collect any personal information through the use of this technology.
If you choose to reject all cookies, anonymous identifiers or similar technology, you may be unable to use much of the functionality of the Service. Unless we associate non-identifying information that we gather through use of technology with your personal information, we will NOT treat such information as personal information.
Information from Other Sources : We may also collect information (including personal information) about you from our Service Providers and other third parties and add it to the personal information we maintain. Request Fulfillment : We use your personal information to confirm, fulfill and ship your orders, to set up appointments that you request, to confirm your entry in our Contests, and to otherwise respond to your requests. We may also use your personal information to contact you if we want to communicate with you about your order, appointment or other request. Promotional Messages : We may also use your personal information to send you newsletters, information about special events, e-mail offers, text message offers, and other savings opportunities; to notify you of changes to the Service; to provide you with up-to-date information on the newest products and services that may be of interest to you; to handle billing disputes with you; and to tailor our online offerings and advertisements to your preferences. We may also use non-identifying information about your visits to the Service and other Web sites in order to provide you with special offers about goods and services of interest to you, make sure you are not shown the same content repeatedly on the Service, deliver information that is specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Service. If you wish to opt-out of the collection and use of information concerning your Web browsing behavior for purposes of serving and better targeting advertisements, please send us an email at customercare@alfredangelo.com to do so. Rewards Program and Advertisements: We may also participate in rewards programs with other business organizations where our customers who are also members of these programs receive a reward from the other businesses for their purchases from Alfred Angelo. We also place advertisements for our products on other Web sites that include a link enabling visitors to click on the link to be taken to the Service and purchase the products featured in the advertisement. In these situations, we share your personal information about your purchases with the other member organizations or Web sites under the contracts these entities have with us. Optional Features : If you choose to participate in certain other features or functions available through the Service, such as customer service, product reviews, wish-lists, and special occasion stories or other Public Conduct, we will use your personal information to administer and operate those features and functions. We may also aggregate information we gather from your Public Conduct with other information we collect from your use of the Service. Other Business Purposes : We may also use personal information, non-identifying information, and aggregated information about our customers' access and navigation of the Service and their browsing and purchasing activities that we and our Service Providers obtain from our use of technology, to improve the Service, and for other business purposes, such as marketing, advertising and research.
Use of Information Provided by You
Alfred Angelo uses personal information provided by you to provide the goods or services you have requested. We may also use personal information to communicate with you about new offers, features, products or services or to improve the services that we offer. Alfred Angelo does not sell your personal information, including your email address to any third party, although we may choose to rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information to selected third parties as set forth in these policies.  In order to facilitate communications between you and affiliated full service bridal salons that carry Alfred Angelo® apparel and accessories, Alfred Angelo sends personal information to such salons who may contact you directly. Personal information may include your name, email address, suggested dress or style information and other personal information you supply to us.  We may also share personal information with others including our affiliates and carefully selected companies who we believe can offer you products or services that may be of interest to you.  If you wish not to have your personal information disclosed or you wish not to be contacted by bridal salons or others, please email or write to us as provided below.
To provide you with better service, we may also use "cookies" which are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user or to facilitate future use of our service.  If we or any of our lines of business are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant customer database may be sold as part of that transaction and your personal information accessed by such successor or purchaser.
Children Under Age 13
We do not collect or disseminate personal information about anyone whom we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13.
Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt credit card numbers to prevent your information from being read during transmission over the Internet. To learn more about SSL, please follow this link to http://www.ssl.com. In addition, we use other means, such as firewalls, to safeguard the confidentiality of this information. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage provides certainty of security. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information that we collect.
