We may also use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you about status of your subscription or problems with your listing.
MEMBER PROFILE- MY VACATIONS
Members can choose to provide AlwaysOnVacation.com with travel preferences and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist members in making booking inquiries quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. If you don't want to store your personal information, you can still research and contact the vacation rental owner or listing manager individually. Keep in mind, however, that certain AlwaysOnVacation.com features (for example, stored vacation rental favorites, or the specials newsletter for your specific destinations) are only available to our members. We may also use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you about any important service updates or other information critical to the services being offered at AlwaysOnVacation.com.
