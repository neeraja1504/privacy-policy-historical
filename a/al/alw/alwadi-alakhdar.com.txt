We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling the abovementioned purposes, other purposes specified by us before or at the time of collecting personal information and other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate or if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm, financial loss, injury to or interference with our rights or property or the rights or property of our users or others, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
