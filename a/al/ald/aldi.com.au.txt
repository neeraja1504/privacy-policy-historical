If you have further questions relating to this Privacy Policy, please contact us at 1 Sargents Road Minchinbury NSW 2770, or by telephone on (02) 9675 9000.
What personal information do we collect?
ALDI Stores collects personal information from customers, employees, contractors, agents and other individuals. We collect this information when it is necessary for business purposes.
So that we can provide and improve our services, we may collect personal information such as:
•your name
•address
•telephone number
•email address,
•other identifiers or identification and / or information about your use of our products and services.
The personal information we collect may be provided on forms filled out by individuals (including when you register on an ALDI Stores website and when you agree to purchase products from us), when you visit an ALDI Stores website, in face-to-face meetings, email messages, telephone conversations, or from third parties. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that contact. We will collect personal information about you only from you where it is reasonable and practical to do so, or required by law.
Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with any products and services that depend on the collection of this information (particularly where our collection of this information is required by law).
We may use cookie technology on our websites to provide information and services to website visitors. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes and are a necessary part of facilitating online transactions. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify you, although they do identify your browser. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. Cookies are useful to determine overall traffic patterns through our websites. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of the services on our websites. Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the internet and may also use cookies to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website. Such cookies are useful to ensure you are shown advertisements which are relevant to you. If you only wish to opt out of targeted advertising by Google, you may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting www.google.com/settings/ads. To opt out of other advertising-related cookies, you can visit www.youronlinechoices.com.au. We may also disclose encrypted copies of your personal information to third party platforms such as Facebook to engage in targeted advertising on such platforms. If you wish to opt out of third party targeted advertising, please update your ad preferences on the relevant third party platform.
We may also use mobile phone technology to track your movement within certain ALDI stores for the purpose of optimizing the merchandising and layout of our stores. If you do not wish to participate you may turn off Bluetooth and WiFi capability on your mobile device.
Employee records are generally not subject to the Privacy Act and, therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the handling of information about employees by ALDI Stores. For information about our practices relating to employee information, please contact us directly.
How is personal information used and disclosed?
The personal information we collect is confidential. Our purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with a better website experience, to provide products or services to you and to operate our business.
Some examples of when we may need to collect, use and disclose this information are in relation to property or supplier enquiries, for email newsletter registration, for providing customers with products and services, and for customer complaint handling.
ALDI Stores may use your personal information to advise you of new products and services or special offers or promotions. ALDI Stores' agents or contractors from time to time may also use your personal information to provide information to you about products and services that they may offer from time to time. If at any time you do not wish to receive such information from us, or our agents, you can opt out of receiving such information when registering on an ALDI Stores website, or you may remove your name from our list by calling us on (02) 9675 9000 and asking to be removed from our mailing list. Alternatively, if we have sent you this information by email, you can use the unsubscribe link at the end of the email. In either case, please allow 5 business days for this request to be processed.
In the course of our business, we use a range of service providers to help us maximise the quality and efficiency of our services and business operations. This means that individuals and organisations outside of ALDI Stores may sometimes have access to personal information held by ALDI Stores and may use this on behalf of ALDI Stores. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purpose.

Please note that ALDI Stores may use overseas facilities to process or back-up information and, as a result, we may transfer your personal information to these overseas facilities for storage. Moreover, if problems arise with the transmission or system handling of e-mails, administrators can analyse logs in order to resolve errors. The logs contain sender, recipient, subject and name/s of any attachment/s. The body text (i.e. contents) of the e-mail is not provided and cannot be seen by administrators.
