Like many websites, we use “cookies.” Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the WEBSITE or SERVICES may not function and appear as we have designed it.

Demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and

B. Pixel Tags.
If we email you, our emails may use “pixel tags” to determine if your email software or site can display html formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).
C. Collection of Information by Third Parties.
Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content on our WEBSITE or via our Services use cookies and may place such cookies on your computer. The content posted by these businesses will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. In addition, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies (1) use information obtained from your visits to this WEBSITE and other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party cookies on your browser. Also, we use web beacons provided by third party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer. Some but not all third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to optout of their technology. For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an optout mechanism, please click the following: https://preferences-mgr.truste.com. The information collected by third party cookies is subject to the privacy policy of the third party, not this Policy.
