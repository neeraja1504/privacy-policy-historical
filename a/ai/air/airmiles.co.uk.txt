When you make a booking, you will be given a booking reference (also known as a PNR or Passenger Name Record). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your booking reference confidential always.Giving your booking reference to others allows them to access your booking details.If you are travelling with others and would not like your individual booking details to be accessible by them, you may prefer each person to make separate bookings.
