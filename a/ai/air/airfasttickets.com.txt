We use cookies on our Web Site to create the most secure and effective website possible for our customers. Among other things, cookies allow you to log on to our booking platform, choose log-in preferences, apply for products and services online and use online tools. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive or device, which enable a web site to “personalize” itself for each user by remembering information about the user’s visit to the web site. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience on our Web Site.
How Are Cookies Used?
Cookies are used for a variety of reasons, such as to safeguard your privacy when browsing the Web Site. They allow you to use functions such as secure online applications. If you leave a secure session window open, cookies will enhance your security by prompting you to end, and/or automatically ending, your secure session. Cookies can also allow us to tailor the content of our Web Site to suit your interests. For example, instead of displaying promotional messages about products you already have, they let us show you other services in which you may be interested. Finally, we use “analytics” cookies to help us make our Web Site better for those who visit it regularly. Cookies help us work out what users like and don't like, and how we can improve things for you.
Working With Third Parties.
No third party has access to the information we collect through the cookies, and we only use cookies from third parties in order to provide our customers with our products and services. The only time cookies would enable us to share your information is when you have given us express consent to pass it on to a trusted third party.
We may, however, share Web Site usage information about visitors to our Web Sites with these third parties for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Web Site and other web sites. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising companies may place pixel tags (also called clear gifs) on some of the pages you visit on our Web Site. We will then use the non-personally identifiable information that is collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other web sites on the Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to specific searches you conducted on the Web Site during earlier browsing sessions. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please send us an email at info@airfasttickets.com.
