2. How we use cookies and similar technology
When you use our website, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, operating system, internet service provider, and the web pages you visit on our website. Air China uses a variety of technologies to access such information including cookies and web beacons to enhance the functionality and usability of our website. This is to ensure that our website, products and services better serve your needs. In addition, we use such information to confirm that visitors are eligible to make service requests and to aggregate website activity data.
(1) Cookie
A cookie is a text-based file that is transmitted by a website to a cookie folder on your computer’s hard drive. This allows the site to remember your identity. Typically, a cookie file contains the name of the domain it is in, the “life cycle” of cookie and a unique value that is randomly generated. This website uses two types of cookies, one is a temporary cookie, which is kept in the browser’s folder while you are browsing the website; the other is a persistent cookie, which is kept in the browser. Most browsers allow visitors to control whether they accept or reject cookies and notify visitors each time they send a cookie. You can choose to reject cookies by adjusting your browser’s settings, but for Air China’s site and other large websites that use cookies, this will limit the use of the site’s features. For more information on cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
(2) Web Beacon
When a user opens a web page containing a web beacon, the web beacon records the user's basic operation along with cookies. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way, it can also collect simple information such as the IP address of your computer, the time and content, the browser the user is using, and the cookies previously set by the server. This information is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not reveal any "extra" information. They are just a simple way to collect the simplest statistics and manage cookies.

3. API/Advanced Passenger Information: An increasing number of countries require incoming airlines to provide passenger information prior to landing. Generally speaking, such laws and regulations require airlines to provide information including passenger identifications and travel documents (passports and visas). Airlines must collect such data before the aircraft takes off. This collection process is increasingly completed through the technology called machine-readable zone (MRZ) used in new travel documents.

For example, we will only inform the advertisers given that they agree to abide by our advertising guidelines as to how effective their advertisements are, how many people have seen their ads or installed apps after seeing them, or provide the partners with statistics that won’t identify our customers (e.g. “male, 25-29 years old, in Beijing”) to help them gain a general understanding of audience or customers.
(2) Suppliers, service providers and other partners. We send information to IT vendors, air carriers, land transport operators, frequent flyer program and non-aviation partners who support our business, and other companies involved in providing customer service or fulfilling customer needs including technical support, customer service, payment assistance, mileage accumulation and redemption, merchandise delivery, mail delivery, membership card production and mailing.

We firmly believe that the information required to be provided should be as transparent as possible to the extent permitted by law. All requests are carefully reviewed to ensure they exposition is limited to data that is required for law enforcement and only that which is necessary for specific investigation purposes.
(4) Exceptions to requiring prior authorisation of consent, sharing, transfer, and public disclosure of personal information
