Terms & Conditions | Aircraft Spruce
SHIPPING AND DELIVERY
Same Day Shipping by 4pm & Delivery Date Estimate
Aircraft Spruce provides same day shipment of in stock items if the order is received prior to 4 pm local time at the origin warehouse of the shipment using the carrier UPS. Orders placed with carrier USPS, FedEx or other carriers are not covered in the 4 pm same day shipping policy. For online orders, items in the Shopping Cart will display stock status as well as an expected delivery day based on the shipping method chosen when "Default"ï¿½ origin is used. This date will factor the time the order is placed as well as origin warehouse and destination zip code. Carrier delays due to weather and other factors outside of our control removes Aircraft Spruce responsibility from quoted delivery date. Delivery dates will depend on exact time of order placement, so the true expected date will be referenced on the Order Confirmation screen. On Backordered items, Out of Stock items, Special Orders, Dropship items, and Non-stocking Products, we will provide an expected ship date if the item is on order from the supplier. However, these dates are expected delivery date of PO's and we cannot guarantee the items will be delivered within that window as factory delays and other elements outside of our control can delay the order.
Ship and Backorder
Orders shipping within the lower 48 USA and within Alaska are defaulted to ship and backorder. If you would like your order held and shipped in one package, please note in the Special Instructions box that you would like the order to 'Ship Complete'. If you have a preferred ship date other than the date of order placement, please note that in the Special Instructions as well. International and Canadian orders are defaulted to Ship Complete when all items are in stock. The customer can select the "Ship and Backorder" option is in the Shopping Cart (Customer will be charged freight on both shipments). Special instructions or credit card declines may delay fulfillment of the order.
Shipping Charges
Shipping charges provided online are calculated from the weights and dimensions of the box(es) required to ship all the items on the order. The system will look for the optimal fulfillment logic to distribute the items to the required warehouse(s). Shipping rates quoted online will be applied to the order at invoicing. The exception to this is the Ship and Backorder option for International shipments in which case an estimate is provided and actual shipping charge will be calculated at time of invoicing each shipment. If the shipping charges seem incorrect for the items on the order, please use the Special Instructions box in the Shopping Cart to request a manual freight quote from a member of our staff. We will evaluate the contents of the order, origin warehouse(es), and destination and provide via email a new shipping quote. Please keep in mind that the order will be held until you confirm the new shipping estimate provided by the staff member.
Shipping costs for certain product mixes or types cannot be calculated online. Examples of these types of products are wood, metal, oversized items, made to order items and other specialty cut materials. When this is the case, the shipping costs will be calculated at the invoicing station. The shipping costs charged will be based on the exact weights and dimensions of the actual box(es) used to ship the order. This condition will be referenced in the shopping cart by a note that says 'We are unable to accurately estimate the shipping costs of your order. Shipping Costs will be Calculated at Time of Shipping'. If you would like a manual estimate before the order ships, please use the Special Instructions box in the Shopping Cart to request a manual freight quote from a member of our staff. We will evaluate the contents of the order, origin warehouse(es), and destination and provide via email a new shipping quote. Please keep in mind that the order will be held until you confirm the new shipping estimate provided by the staff member.
Some oversize charges which were not able to be predicted online will be assessed at time of shipment. Packages over 48 inches in length will be assessed an additional handling fee as declared in the carrier's service guide. All packages will be charged at the greater of actual or dimensional weight. Pursuant to the carrier service guide, packages over 96 inches in length or 130 inches length and girth will also be assessed a fee for exceeding the maximum package size, in addition to being billed at a 90lb oversize rate. Dimensional weight is calculated as the total cubic inches of a package divided by a dimensional weight factor (domestic US is 194, outside US is 166). Some oversized items can be cut for shipping. If you think this might apply, please return to your shopping cart and include cutting instructions in the Special Instructions box.
Hazardous items may be assessed an additional hazardous shipping charge for each package containing hazardous materials. This fee, if it applies, will be added to the calculated freight charge. Shipping charges for phone in sales are calculated at the time of shipping based on the weights and dimensions of the box(es) used to ship the order. If you would like an estimate, just ask your friendly Aircraft Spruce sales agent and they will provide you one.
Free Shipping on Orders Over $350 / $195
Most orders over $350 in merchandise value, shipping within the 48 contiguous United States and within Alaska, will be shipped prepaid, with Aircraft Spruce paying the shipping cost. If your order qualifies for free shipping, it will be offered as a shipping method in the Shopping Cart. 'Free Ground' must be selected as the shipping method for the order to ship prepaid. Any other shipping selection will bill the quoted amount at the time of invoicing. Please inquire at the time of order if you have questions regarding the free shipping policy as it applies to your order. Normally, Free Shipping orders will be shipped via UPS, although if it is more economical, a different service like USPS may be used. Orders shipping by Fedex Ground do not qualify for prepaid shipping. Prepaid shipping is offered on battery and tire orders (some exceptions apply). For our dealer and wholesale customers, free shipping is offered for orders over $195. The same rules in the above section apply to the dealer free shipping policy. Free shipping must be requested at the time of order with your sales person on phone in orders. To qualify for free shipping in Alaska, the order must ship from our local Alaska branch in Wasilla to qualify.
Free Truck Freight on Orders over $5000
Aircraft Spruce will offer free freight on truck orders over $5,000. This is for all truck orders shipped to the 48 lower states. The order will have to ship from the warehouse closest to the customer. We will hold the order until we can ship complete from the closest warehouse to customer. If a customer wants us to ship and backorder, we will pay the freight on the first shipment by truck, but the customer will be responsible for the freight on the backordered items. 55 gallon drums and engine cylinders are excluded from free truck freight offer.
Free Shipping Exclusions
Orders that contain 5 gallon containers, engine cylinders, oversized items, specially cut materials (ie wood, metal, foam, rolled fabric, etc), packages measuring more than 84 inches length and girth or 48 inches long or exceed 100 pounds total weight are excluded from this promotion. Special order or made to order items may be excluded from the shipping promotion. Core charges, hazardous materials fees, box charges, and insurance are not considered part of the order minimum for free shipping evaluation. Please note that Aircraft Spruce prepaid shipping policies do not apply to COD orders.
Order Fulfillment / Rates
Domestic / Lower 48 Default Origin
UPS Ground: Automated fulfilment logic evaluates contents of order, parts availability and destination to determine warehouse allocation and rate. The system will determine the warehouse with the best combination of stock, transit time, and distance and allocate as many parts from this warehouse as possible. If there are remaining items, it will consolidate to the least number of shipments. The orders will be automatically split and fulfilled from the warehouses determined as required by the system. The shopping cart and order confirmation screen will show the estimated delivery dates for each shipment that you can expect for your order. The freight charge quoted online is calculated by determining the package size(s) required to ship the order complete from the primary warehouse selected. The freight charge, if applicable, will be applied to the primary shipment, and the other shipments will invoice with no additional freight costs. When the basket contains item(s) that are not covered in our free shipping policy as additional shipments, i.e. metal, wood, oversized items, etc, the default logic will evaluate each origin as the primary warehouse and select the lowest possible cost fulfilment. This may mean that another primary warehouse selection could provide parts sooner, but the logic will provide the most economical fulfillment option. Each package will rate from the warehouse it is shipping from, and the rate in the shopping cart will be the sum of all shipments required to complete the order. Each shipment will be invoiced with the associated charge for the items on that invoice.
UPS Next Day / 2-Day / 3-Day: Default logic will evaluate the contents of the order, the destination, and the available warehouses with respect to warehouse same-day shipping cutoff times. When all warehouses are open, the system will look for the combination of most complete and closest. However, if a further warehouse is complete but the closer warehouse will require multiple shipments due to incomplete stock, the system will select the further warehouse to minimize the number of shipments and freight cost for the customer. As warehouse cutoff times pass, the system will look to get all parts from open warehouses to ship same day for soonest possible delivery. As a result, the default logic for UPS Air methods may not be the most economical, but will ensure that the parts will deliver as quickly and efficiently as possible. Each package will rate from the warehouse it is shipping from, and the rate in the shopping cart will be the sum of all shipments required to complete the order. Each shipment will be invoiced with the associated freight charge for the items on that invoice.
USPS: For USPS Priority and First Class Mail, the default logic will run through each origin as the primary warehouse and select the lowest possible cost fulfilment. This may mean that another primary warehouse selection could provide parts sooner, but the logic will look for the most economical. Each package will rate from the warehouse it is shipping from, and the rate in the shopping cart will be the sum of all shipments required to complete the order. Each shipment will be invoiced with the associated charge for the items on that invoice. Please note that USPS orders are not covered under our "Orders by 4pm Same Day Shipping"ï¿½ policy. USPS orders generally ship the following business day. Delivery dates provided are estimates, items may arrive sooner or later than displayed in the checkout. First Class Mail shipments are not trackable, allow 7-10 business days for arrival. USPS options are not offered on all orders due to carrier restrictions (i.e. Hazardous, over-weight, etc).
LTL Freight: Orders that are over the maximum weight / dimensions for UPS ground will be offered UPS LTL Freight. The default selection will choose a primary warehouse (West, Midwest, East), and import the order to that warehouse as one complete order. The shipping rate provided in the cart is for the entire order to ship from that origin warehouse. The rate provided in the cart is for the entire order to be fulfilled as one shipment from the selected origin warehouse. The order will ship when all stock is on hand at the warehouse.
Warehouse Origin Override
UPS Ground: If the user overrides the origin warehouse and chooses the primary warehouse from the list of warehouses and the items on the order are not excluded from our free shipping offer, i.e. hazardous, oversized, metal, wood, etc, the order will import to the selected warehouse as a complete order. The shipping rate provided will be the complete order from the warehouse selected. We will process the order through the warehouse selected and fill the available parts from that warehouse. Once invoiced, a backorder will generate which will be filled in the most efficient way determined. No additional freight costs will be applied to the backorders. If the basket contains items that are excluded from our free freight policy, the system will fill the parts from the selected warehouse, and use the automated logic set forth in the previous section to most efficiently fill the remaining items. The order will be automatically split and filled from the necessary warehouses. The shipping rate provided in the shopping cart will be the sum of each package / warehouse required to complete the order. The individual shipments will get the appropriate individual rates applied to them at invoicing.
USPS: The system will fill the parts from the selected warehouse, and use the automated logic set forth in the previous section to most efficiently fill the remaining items. The order will be automatically split and fill from the necessary warehouses. The shipping rate provided in the shopping cart will be the sum of each package from the warehouses required to complete the order. The individual shipments will get the appropriate individual rates applied to them at invoicing. Same USPS notes and restrictions stated in previous section apply.
LTL Freight: The Order will import to the selected warehouse with the shipping rate determined by the complete order shipping from that location. The order is set to ship complete upon import, and we will wait for complete stock before sending the order. If ship and backorder is requested, additional shipping charges will apply.
Alaska
When an Alaskan zip code is entered as the destination, the warehouse origin will default to our Wasilla, AK location. This local operation provides the most economical shipping rates and you will be provided with a delivery schedule for the in stock items. Items not in stock at the local branch will be transferred from other locations and fulfilled from the Alaska branch when they are received unless otherwise directed. The user also has the option in the shopping cart to select an origin warehouse in the lower 48, at which point the shipping rate provided will be for all packages required to fill the order.
International
For international destinations, the system will evaluate stock at all export warehouses to determine the default selection of warehouse origin. The user can override the selection and choose a different warehouse origin. The orders are rated as complete by default, and all parts on the order are imported to the selected origin. The user can select to have the items "Ship and Backorder"ï¿½, in which case, the system will estimate the shipping for the items in stock at the selected warehouse, as well as estimate the shipping for the items not in stock as a complete second shipment. The estimates will be added together and a freight estimate provided. Please note the "Ship and Backorder"ï¿½ option will provide a freight estimate only, and actual freight will be calculated based on the packages' weight / dimensions at the time of shipping.
International Shipping
Aircraft Spruce is recognized as the leading source of materials for aircraft builders, owners and pilots around the world. Over the past 50 years we have developed a family of customers in every part of the globe. Our International order department is more than happy to assist you in placing and processing your order for international shipment. Please note the following guidelines for placing an international order. You may place your order with any of our international representatives or directly with our USA, Corona facility. Correspondence should be sent in English or Spanish to expedite service.
To economize on the shipping costs, International orders are generally shipped complete unless otherwise advised by the customer. We utilize UPS, Fed-Ex and Air Parcel Post for most international shipments. Shipments by UPS and Fed-Ex are highly recommended because of the excellent traceability of the shipments. Parcel post traces are very time consuming and unreliable. We cannot be responsible for shipments made by Parcel Post. Our international department also utilizes the services of many other air and sea carriers. Should the services of a freight forwarder be necessary we can work with one who is familiar with our service or with one of your choice to meet all your shipment requirements.
All freight, duty and customs charges are the responsibility of the customer. If Aircraft Spruce is billed these charges on your behalf, you agree that you will be billed by Aircraft Spruce for these charges.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. We are also PCI compliant. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our user's information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

Please note the following guidelines for placing an international order. You may place your order with any of our international representatives or directly through our website or international sales department. Correspondence should be sent in English or Spanish to expedite service.
Requests for quotation are processed within 72 hours, unless additional research is required on a product. All prices quoted and invoiced by Aircraft Spruce West are FOB Corona, CA and by Aircraft Spruce East are FOB, Peachtree City, GA. A quotation is processed as a proforma invoice for all overseas customers. A proforma invoice is not considered an order until funds are received to process the order. Actual freight charges may differ from a freight quote or estimate provided by a freight carrier.
First time orders are preferably received by fax, e-mail, or website to insure correct notation of name and billing and shipping information. Please note the information on 8130 forms in the following paragraphs. If 8130 forms are required, we must be notified at the time the order is placed so that we may special order the documentation.
To economize on the shipping costs, International orders are generally shipped complete unless otherwise advised by the customer. We utilize DHL, UPS, Fed-Ex and Air Parcel Post for most international shipments. Shipments by DHL, UPS and Fed-Ex are highly recommended because of the excellent traceability of the shipments. Parcel post traces are very time consuming and unreliable. We cannot be responsible for shipments made by USPS Parcel Post. Our international department also utilizes the services of many other air and sea carriers. Should the services of a freight forwarder be necessary we can work with one who is familiar with our service or with one of your choice to meet your shipment requirements.
<4>All freight, duty and customs charges are the responsibility of the customer.
Preferred methods of payment are credit cards (American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover) and by bank transfer. There is an additional $20 service charge for bank transfers. When making a bank transfer please fax a copy of your transfer along with your order request to ensure accurate allocation of funds. Please note that if payment is made by bank transfer there is an approximate 7 day delay before funds are confirmed and allocated.

OTHER CONDITIONS OF SALE
Ship and Backorder
Our default shipping option will allow us to ship all in stock products to you immediately from the nearest geographic warehouse with inventory and backorder any items which are not in stock. The items that did not ship will be sent from the next closest warehouse with inventory. If we do not have any inventory of the product, we will ship the parts as soon as any warehouse receives stock from our suppliers. Aircraft Spruce pays the freight on most backorder shipments within the lower 48 states (except oversize packages, hazardous products, and products which would have required a separate package if shipped with the first shipment). Unless otherwise instructed, we will Ship and Backorder (if necessary) to insure prompt delivery of all in stock items.
Hold and Ship Complete
This shipping option instructs us to hold your entire order until all items are in stock. You authorize us to charge your credit card for the entire amount of the order to secure those parts for you in advance, even if the order cannot ship the same day due to backordered items. This will allow for all items on your order to ship at one time, but it can also cause indefinite delays in shipment if any items are not in stock and delivery from our suppliers is delayed. We do not recommend this option except for certain export orders or orders where the products not in stock are oversize or hazardous, which would require additional shipping charges if backordered and shipped later. If the only products missing are small and can be shipped by mail, we will backorder them and ship all in stock items immediately. Please request this in the Special Instructions box in the Shopping Cart if you prefer this option.
Certificate of Conformance and Form 8130 (Export)
Aircraft Spruce provides you with its own Certificate of Conformance for our products at no charge. This is noted on every invoice. Factory certification and test reports are available on some items and 8130 Forms are available on FAA approved products. A cost of $15 per product on manufacturer certs and $50 per product on 8130 forms is charged to secure these forms. Please inquire at time of order if test reports/8130 Forms are available for the items you are ordering. If available, the forms must be requested at time of order and in some cases the product must be special-ordered from the factory with the forms. These forms cannot be furnished after you receive the product. Anticipate shipping delays if 8130 Forms are requested. If you require these forms, you can request that the salesperson add them to your order. If you are ordering online, you can check off which form you require for each item in your cart. The system will automatically add the $15 or $50 charge to your bill. Due to delays and costs involved in furnishing these forms, we strongly suggest that you check to see if the Aircraft Spruce Certificate of Conformance will be acceptable in lieu of Form 8130.
Cutting Charges
Certain orders for cut materials (i.e. wood, metal, etc) may incur an additional cutting charge. Nearly all our cut material orders are shipped with no additional charges, however, should your order warrant a cutting charge, you will be contacted with an explanation and request for approval. If approved, we will proceed with the order and if it is not approved we will provide alternative solutions.
ADDING ON TO AN ORDER
In order to ensure efficient, accurate processing of orders in the warehouse, we have several restrictions for adding on to placed orders. The restrictions include:
Orders that have "Packed" or "Invoiced" status
Orders qualifying for free shipping
Orders placed by PayPal
Orders containing special order items
We have also implemented a 1:00 pm local time cutoff for add-ons at the respective origin warehouse on the day the order is shipping. If the order has an "open" status and it is before the 1:00 pm cutoff, you can add on to it using the website or by calling our Customer Service department. If we cannot add products to the open order due to the restrictions listed above, we will be glad to take a new order for the additional products.
OUR 100% RECYCLED, BIODEGRADABLE PACKING PAPER
Aircraft Spruce has used biodegradable corn starch packing peanuts to pack outgoing orders for a number of years which provided excellent protection of the products in the box, but could also cause a mess when the box was opened and unpacked. We have looked for a more customer friendly packing material alternative for some time, and we are pleased to announce that we are now using a 100% recycled, 100% biodegradable paper packing material to replace the peanuts. This material is suitable to our high volume shipping requirements, protects the contents of the box as well as the peanuts, and will allow customers to unpack their shipments without having to pick up peanuts afterward.
INVOICE / ORDERS PAID BY CHECK
For our customer's convenience we enclose a copy of the invoice covering the order with each order shipped except those shipped to a third party. If the order is paid by check and the check did not cover the full amount of the invoice, the amount of underpayment will be sent C.O.D. for the balance due plus C.O.D. fee of $10.50 rather than delay the order. If you have overpaid by check, the overpayment will be credited to your account or refunded. C.O.D. shipments are considered paid as soon as we receive payment from UPS, and credit card orders are paid automatically at time of shipment.
WHEN YOU RECEIVE YOUR ORDER
Upon receipt, the package should be opened promptly and material checked against the packing slip enclosed. Items out-of-stock at time of shipment will be marked as back-ordered to follow.' These items will not be charged on the invoice enclosed with the package and will be forwarded as soon as delivery is received from our suppliers. The backordered items will not be charged until shipped. About 90% of the items featured in our catalog are carried in stock. Special items of hardware, bearings, unusual fittings and slow moving items are special ordered as required. However, even with the large inventory we carry, it is not uncommon to come up short on some items. If an item is missing and not marked backordered, please advise us immediately.
BACKORDERS
Backorder are shipped from the warehouse that receives stock first. Although we make every effort to ship all orders complete, it is often necessary to backorder one or more items if we are out of stock. When the partial order is shipped and invoiced, you are not charged for the backordered item(s) until these items are shipped. You are billed only for what is shipped. A backorder is created and shipped as soon as the items arrive. The backorder is then invoiced and any overpayment from the first invoice is applied to it. If you do not wish to have any items backordered, or wish to cancel an existing backorder, just let us know. We will do so immediately if the backorder has not been shipped. We are working continuously to keep all items in stock to preclude backorders. If a backorder is necessary, we do appreciate your patience. Aircraft Spruce pays the shipping costs within the 48 contiguous United States by surface shipping on backorders when the backordered items could have been shipped via UPS inside the first package at no additional freight cost. Except when the backordered items are oversize, hazardous, contain one gallon or larger, or COD shipments. We will continue to strive to maintain stock of all our products to keep the necessity for backordering parts to a minimum.
AMAZON RESELLERS / PROCESSING FEES
Any customer that is inputting orders obtained from other websites, ie Amazon.com, and processing them through Aircraft Spruce is subject to an additional charge per item for handling, packaging, marketing, et al. Free shipping offers may be voided on orders obtained from other selling channels. All accounts can be suspended without notice if the account experiences high volumes of customer service issues.
OPEN ACCOUNT

Established companies can apply for an open account by submitting a credit application including all company data and at least three business references and bank information. Credit application forms available on request. Open account terms are net 15 days after invoice date.
DEALER / OEM / WHOLESALE DISCOUNTS
We have offered discounts to our regular dealers and FBO's for many years for resale purposes, and we welcome the addition of new dealers to best serve aviation consumers worldwide. Due to the very competitive and low margin nature of most of the prices shown in this catalog, all discounts are based on volume purchasing. Discounts for many items are shown below the product in the catalog. Discounts for items with discounts not shown in the catalog or for larger quantities than those listed can be quoted by mail, phone, or FAX upon request. You can be assured, as an aviation dealer, that you will receive the best possible net prices from Aircraft Spruce on all product lines that we carry. If you ever find a lower current advertised price on any product, just let us know and we'll beat it. Call for an Aircraft Spruce dealer application if interested in becoming a dealer of Aircraft Spruce.
SPECIAL ORDER ITEMS
Over the years, one of the services that our company offers that seems to be most appreciated by our customers is our willingness to research and provide quotations for special items. Other supply firms tend to discourage special requests due to the time and effort it takes to find these items, and request that customers order catalog items only. We have always taken a different approach and welcome requests for non-catalog items. Call or write and provide as much information as possible including make, model, serial number of aircraft and exact part number or product you need, plus your credit card number. Within 24 hours if possible, we will advise you of the price and delivery time on the item, at which time you can place your order if acceptable. Once an order is placed for a special order item, it cannot be cancelled or returned and must be paid in advance. If we cannot drop ship your special order, then freight charges from the factory to our warehouse will be added to your invoice. Our goal is to provide you with everything you need - if you do not find it in this catalog, let us know and we'll find it for you!
NON-STOCKING ITEMS
Non-stocking products from Aircraft Spruce are products that we do not carry in our warehouses and must be specially ordered. It is the customer's responsibility to determine that the product is correct for their own application. By purchasing non-stocking products, the customer is agreeing to pay any cancellation or restocking fee assessed by the manufacturer or supplier should the customer wish to cancel or return the item. Additional inbound freight may also apply to get non-stocking products from the manufacturer to our warehouse if a direct dropship is not an option. Some items may be non-cancellable / non-returnable once ordered. We suggest contacting a sales agent for lead time details prior to placing the order to ensure we can meet your delivery schedule. By submitting the order for a non-stocking product, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. Please call our sales staff for any additional questions or concerns.
WAIVER OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
