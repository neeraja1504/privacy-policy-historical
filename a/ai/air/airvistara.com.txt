General Customer Data privacy policy statement
1. Types of Customer Data
The types of Customer Data that TSAL collects depends on the circumstances of collection and on the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.

For purposes of this policy statement, Customer Data means Personal Data and Technical Data.
We also use Customer Data to derive Statistical Data, such as the number of passengers. This is processed and stored purely for analytical purposes, and is entirely anonymous. This information will not be stored to your customer record, and will only be aggregated for statistical analysis so that we can better understand TSAL's customer profile and improve TSAL's service offering.
Special categories of information or “sensitive personal data”
Certain categories of Customer Data, such as information about your race, ethnicity, religion or health, are considered special categories of information, or “sensitive personal data” under the GDPR.
Generally, we try to limit the circumstances where we collect your sensitive personal data. However, this can occasionally occur because you have made certain requests in connection with your travel arrangements that reveal or suggest something about you that could be considered “sensitive personal data”, or if you otherwise choose to provide such information to us (or a third party such as the travel agent through which you made your booking).
For example:
if you request a particular type of meal, e.g. halal or kosher meals, this may imply or suggest that you are a member of a particular religion;or
if you request specific medical assistance from us and/or an airport operator, e.g. the provision of a wheelchair, this may reveal that you have a particular medical condition.
How we collect data from you
TSAL collects Customer Data, either directly from you or from your authorised representatives (i.e. persons whom you have authorised and/or persons who have been validly identified as being your authorised representative (e.g. your organisation’s corporate travel manager/agent) pursuant to our then-current security procedures).
TSAL also collects Customer Data from third parties which are located in various countries. This includes, but is not limited to, travel agents, our Club Vistara partners (including, amongst others, airlines and non-airlines), our service providers, other airlines to facilitate travel on code share or multi-airline flights, or through our Website, mobile services, any posts on TSAL-specific pages on social media websites and other channels including our ticketing counters and airport operations.
Where you make reservations on behalf of another person, you undertake and will ensure that the individual whose Customer Data is supplied to TSAL has authorised the disclosure, is informed of and agrees to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
