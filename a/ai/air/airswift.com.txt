USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION
We are committed to protecting your privacy and will only use your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, including the Data Protection Act 1998 and (once applicable) the General Data Protection Regulation and the UK implementing legislation. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:
where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you;
where we need to comply with a legal obligation; and
where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:
where we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests); and
where it is needed in the public interest.
We need all the categories of information in the list in paragraph 1 above primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties, provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. There are more limited circumstances where we process personal data pursuant to your consent. The situations in which we will process your personal information are listed below.
making a decision about your recruitment or appointment;
determining the terms on which you work for us;
checking you are legally entitled to work in your assignment location;
paying you and, if you are an employee, deducting tax and National Insurance or Social Security contributions;
providing benefits of employment, including flexible benefits
liaising with your pension provider;
administering the contract we have entered into with you;
business management and planning, including accounting and auditing;
conducting performance reviews, managing performance and determining performance requirements;
making decisions about salary reviews and compensation;
assessing qualifications for a particular job or task, including decisions about promotions;
gathering evidence for possible grievance or disciplinary hearings;
making decisions about your continued employment or engagement;
making arrangements for the termination of our working relationship
education, training and development requirements
dealing with legal disputes involving you, or other employees, workers and contractors, including accidents at work;

managing sickness absence;
complying with health and safety obligations;
to prevent fraud;
to monitor your use of our information and communication systems to ensure compliance with our IT policies;
to ensure network and information security, including preventing unauthorised access to our computer and electronic communications systems and preventing malicious software distribution; and
[to conduct data analytics studies to review and better understand employee retention and attrition rates;]
equal opportunities monitoring;
shareholding, options and dividend details.
Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you (such as paying you or providing a benefit), or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety of our workers).
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
”Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:
in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent;
where we need to carry out our legal obligations or perform a contract with you;
where it is needed in the public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring [or in relation to our occupational pension scheme]; and
where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.
Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.
We will use your personal information in the following special categories in the following ways:
we will use information relating to your absence from work, which may include sickness absence or family-related absences, to comply with employment and other laws;
we will use information about criminal convictions to comply with law and in order to determine your eligibility to undertake particular types of work;
we will use information about your physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure your health and safety in the workplace and to assess your fitness to work, to provide appropriate workplace adjustments, to monitor and manage sickness absence and to administer benefits;
we will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting; and
We will use trade union membership information to pay trade union premiums, register the status of a protected employee and to comply with employment law obligations.
We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.
Where you have given us your consent to use your personal information in a particular manner, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time, which you may do by contacting us as described in paragraph 8. Please note however that the withdrawal of your consent will not affect any use of the data made before you withdrew your consent and we may still be entitled to hold and process the relevant personal information to the extent that we are entitled to do so on bases other than your consent.
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may share your personal information where it is necessary to administer the working relationship or we have a legitimate interest in so doing. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply such other terms as apply to our relationship, or to protect rights, property, or safety of our other employees, workers and contractors our customers, ourselves or others. with you or where we have a legitimate interest in doing so.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of providing references and fraud protection.

a country in the European Economic Area or that is otherwise considered to have data protection rules that are equivalent to those in the United Kingdom; or
a country which is not considered to have the same standards of protection for personal data as those in the United Kingdom, in which case we will take all steps required by law to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information, including where appropriate putting in place contractual terms approved by the relevant regulatory authorities.

In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

You should use a unique password for every account. Further details are in our IT and password policies.
RETENTION, UPDATING AND REMOVAL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
The duration for which we retain your personal information will differ depending on the type of information and the reason why we collected it from you. However, in some cases personal information may be retained on a long term basis: for example, personal information that we need to retain for legal purposes will normally be retained for at least six years in accordance with usual commercial practice and regulatory requirements.
It is important to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date, and you should let us know if anything changes, for example if you move home or change your phone number or email address. You may be able to update some of the personal information we hold about you through our customer portal. Alternatively, you can contact us using the details in paragraph 8.

request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;
request the erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to stop processing personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground;
request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and
request the transfer of your personal information to another party.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
