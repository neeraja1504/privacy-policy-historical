Verifying your identity where you request access to your information
Where you request access to your information, we are required by law to use all reasonable measures

that information.
If it is not possible to identity you from such information, or if we have insufficient information about you,
we may require original or certified copies of certain documentation in order to be able to verify your
identity before we are able to provide you with access to your information.
We will be able to confirm the precise information we require to verify your identity in your specific
circumstances if and when you make such a request.

purposes; and
•   to object to us using or processing your information for direct marketing purposes (including
any profiling we engage in that is related to such direct marketing).
