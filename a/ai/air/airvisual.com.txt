We use this information to provide, develop and improve IQAir AirVisual products and services, including to make assessments and recommendations about products and safety.
We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our servers. Depending on your location and type of data, IQAir may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home country. In general for purposes of applicable law (e.g. GDPR), IQAir is a controller of the information collected in connection with the Products and Services. Our legal basis for processing information: If European data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, based on the following legal grounds:
When we’re providing a product or service.
We process your data to provide and support a product or service that you’ve asked for under a contract.
When we’re pursuing legitimate interests.
We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:
· offering and improving IQAir AirVisual products and services
· developing new products and features
· understanding how people use our products and services
· sending you direct marketing and other communications from IQAir
· protecting against harm to the rights, property and safety of IQAir, our users, and the public

If you select an outside party for the purchase, or service of your IQAir AirVisual device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you buy an IQAir AirVisual monitor from a retailer, the retailer may collect personal information as part of the transaction.
