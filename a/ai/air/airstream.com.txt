For example, we collect personal information when you communicate with us, when you submit content to the Website, when you indicate an interest in our products, and when you purchase or register our products. We may also lawfully obtain information from other companies within the Thor Industries, Inc. corporate family and from third party sources, such as independent dealers, Airstream, Inc. licensees, Airstream, Inc.’s vendors, and other companies which provide lists of potential customers.

Information accessed from social media providers, if you make use of any Website social media features, in accordance with the social media providers’ policies.
Other Non-Personal Information. We may also gather non-personal information that does not personally identify you. This information may include general demographic information, automatically-collected session information (such as your browser and information collected by cookies and related technologies), and compiled data.
Like many other commercial websites, our Website uses “cookies” and web server log files to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website.
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit our Website, our site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Any website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Website will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive.
We also work with third-parties to provide us with analyses of the usage and browsing patterns of visitors to our Website by tracking non-personally identifiable information about our visitors and customers. We also use similar technology to serve online advertising promoting products which our visitors and customers may be interested. These third parties include Google Analytics and Facebook. These services are cookie-based and do not collect personal information. Each third party is subject to its own privacy policy.
Through our Website, we may also collect non-personal information about the device you use to access the Website, your IP addresses, geo-location information, and unique device identifiers. While we may log your IP address for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes, we do not use your IP address to track your session, nor do we associate your IP address to anything personally identifiable.
“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Airstream, Inc.’s Website honors “do not track” signals.
CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
Our Website does not track your personal information over time or track personally-identifiable browsing history over other sites.

Our Website may, however, either directly or through a third party service provider, track non-personal data or browsing history over time through the use of an anonymous unique identifier.
