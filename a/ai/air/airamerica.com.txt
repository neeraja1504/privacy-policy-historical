Air America Media (“Air America,” “we” or “us”) has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Air America websites (the “Air America site”).
Air America gathers certain information that you provide to us, some passively and some actively, and we want to ensure that all users of the Air America site are aware of exactly how and for what purpose that information is being used.  Air America believes that the information you provide to us is essential to your enjoyment and successful use of the Air America site. Our collection of information enables us to provide you with a personalized web experience, and assists our sales team and advertisers in efficiently reaching an appropriate audience. The information we request is the minimum we believe necessary to achieve this goal.
1.    What data does Air America collect?
a.    Certain data is automatically collected from all visitors to the Air America site. This data includes your IP address, your computer's operating system, and the type of browser you use to surf the Internet.
b.    Air America makes use of cookies on its sites. A cookie is a file transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website may track your activities on the website. Cookies, by themselves, do not let a website know any personally identifying information about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously provided that information at the website or have set your preferences in your browser to provide that information. Air America is not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information about any one person using cookies. Cookie technology allows Air America to keep track of your selections on the Air America site and to try to make sure that you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Cookies are also used to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Air America site.
c.    To access the Air America site, you do not have to provide any personal information. Some features of the Air America site do request personal information of you before granting access, however.
d.    If you wish to participate in the blog features offered on the Air America site, you will be asked to create a username and password to be used when replying to blog entries as well as for your name, e-mail address, and zip code. You will also be asked whether you want to receive future e-communications from Air America. If you opt for this feature, you must provide a valid e-mail address during the registration process. When replying to these blog posts, you will do so under your chosen username.

Your e-mail address will be used only by Air America for the distribution of the newsletter and any promotions or marketing that we feel may be of interest to you and will not be divulged to any third party, except as required by court order. All Air America newsletters include an unsubscribe link in at the very bottom. Clicking this link will unsubscribe you immediately.
f.    Occasionally, Air America will request you to fill out a user survey. Such surveys are optional to you, the users, but allow Air America to better understand the demographics and interests of our users. Your responses in combination with the responses of our other users help Air America to improve the Air America site and attract sponsors and advertisers. Should you choose to participate in such a survey, please note Air America's policies regarding the sharing of user information with third parties as stated 2. If and when Air America does choose to share its user information, it does so only in the aggregate such that the third party will not be able to identify any individual user.
g.    Air America may occasionally run contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions sponsored by Air America or our partners and sponsors. If you are identified as a winner, Air America may request your name and mailing address. This information is used to deliver your prize(s). Air America may supply third-party sponsors with personal information collected from contests and sweepstakes entrants in connection with certain online contests and sweepstakes. In each such case, Air America will disclose to potential entrants that such information will be supplied to a third party, and the identity of such third party, at the time entrant information is collected. Please see Paragraph 3d below for more details.
h.    If you contact Air America through the regular mail or via e-mail, Air America may keep a record of that correspondence. Any personally identifiable information on your communication will not be used for a commercial or unlawful purpose.
i.    Air America does not control the acts of its users. All users should be aware that, when they disclose personal information such as their actual name, e-mail address, etc., the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties outside Air America.
2.    The privacy of minors.
a.    Air America believes that it is particularly important to protect the privacy of minors online. Air America defines a “minor” as any person under 13 years of age. Air America does not collect personal information about minors.
b.    When you order products from us, we also collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address and a password. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains. These changes will be automatically kept for future use.
c.    We use good faith efforts not to provide third parties with access to your individual account information, unless stated otherwise on the site. We reserve the right to provide non-identifiable consumer data to third parties including, but not limited to, general statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information.
3.    How does Air America use your information?  Air America puts the non-personally identifiable information passively gathered whenever you visit our sites and the personal information that you voluntarily provide to several uses.

e.    Both our internal sales team and outside advertising firms may utilize the information you provide us to better tailor your experience on the Air America site. Without the data collected, Air America would not know what the most popular regions of the Air America site are, Air America would not be able to provide an effective forum for our sponsors to advertise in, nor would Air America be able to measure which promotions are successful.
4.    What information does Air America share with third parties?
a.    Unless described herein, Air America will not impart to third parties individual users' e-mail addresses or other individual personal information unless required to do so by law.

We do not control these cookies, nor do we have access to this information. The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by a third party, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you on this site.
c.    From time to time, Air America may offer contests and sweepstakes sponsored by third party businesses or in connection with third party content partners. Air America may share with such third parties entrant information collected by Air America only if the entrant opts in to receive information from such third party. In these types of contests and sweepstakes, Air America will disclose to potential entrants that such information will be so supplied and the identity of the third party to whom such information will be supplied at the time entrant information is collected and will provide entrants with the opportunity to opt in to receive such third party information. However, any information supplied to a third party may be retained by such third party and will be out of the control of Air America. Air America is not responsible for privacy practices or the third parties use of such information.
d.    Air America encourages all third parties to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users, but Air America does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.
e.    Air America responds to subpoenas, warrants or other court orders regarding information that is contained within our access logs concerning any user. Air America also reserves the right to release the information concerning a user who we believe is in violation of our content guidelines or United States law, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. Air America cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our servers for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any illegal activity to law enforcement for prosecution.
