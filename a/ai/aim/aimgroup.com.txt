Our legal basis for processing your personal information
Much of our processing will be under the basis of “contractual obligation.” In other words, we need and use your personal information to provide services you or your company have requested from us or have contracted us to provide. However, when we communicate with you regarding products and services you may be interested in receiving from us or from current or potential partners, our basis for processing is our legitimate interest. As we are communicating with you in the context of your corporate activity and identity and not in relation to your private life, we believe this is reasonable and fair in the context of our audience. Of course, you always have the option to object, unsubscribe from our communications, and / or have your details removed as detailed below.
Asking us to suppress or remove your personal information
If you do not want to receive information from us in the future you can quickly ask us to stop emailing you by clicking the unsubscribe link you will find on many of our service and marketing e-mails or by sending your details to  privacy@AIM Group.com. If, additionally, you want us to remove your information entirely (and assuming we have no other obligation to keep it) please let us know and we will do this – but we would encourage you to let us continue using it for suppression purposes only, i.e. as a record that you do not want to receive further information from us.
What to do if you have a complaint
If you have a complaint about our handling of your data, send it to privacy@AIMGroup.com and we will deal with your request promptly. If you are not satisfied with the way your complaint was handled, you can refer your complaint to the relevant data protection regulator in your country or elsewhere in the world.
