You may, of course, decline to share your Personal Information with Company, in which case Company will not be able to provide to you some or all of the features and functionality found on the Service.
You have the right to object to and opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Company’s Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out of further Processing by contacting privacy@autolist.com. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Site and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to Users' profiles. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
Email and Telephone Communications
If you receive promotional email from Company, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from Company, you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested, and you will continue to receive certain non-promotional communications regarding Company and our Service and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).
Mobile devices
Company may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications with notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. Company may also collect location-based information if you use our mobile applications. You may opt out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.
Human Resources Data
With regard to Personal Information that Company receives in connection with the employment relationship, Company will use such Personal Information only for employment-related purposes as more fully described above. If Company intends to use this Personal Information for any other purpose, Company will notify the Individual and provide an opportunity to opt out of such uses.
“Do Not Track”
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that Users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for Users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp , or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here .
To be clear, whether you are using our opt out or an online industry opt out, these cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction
You may inquire as to whether Company is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to privacy@autolist.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Company. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Company makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Company is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Company determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Company will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
Data Retention
Company retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Service or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Service, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
Security of Your Information
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
If Company learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
