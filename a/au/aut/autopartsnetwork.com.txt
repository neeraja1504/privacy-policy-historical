PRIVACY POLICY
AutoPartsNetwork.com, together with its related and affiliated entities, (collectively “APN”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors. In compliance with Federal and State Law, industry standards and administrative regulations, this privacy policy discloses the privacy practices governing our collection and use of information submitted by you (“you”, “your” or the “user”) to APN through this web site. We want you to know that we take our legal and ethical responsibilities regarding your privacy seriously. Therefore, we abide the following privacy policy.
Information Collection & Use
Registration
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and other parties who must use that information to provide products and services to you. Their right to further disclose and use the information is limited by our company policies, applicable law, and nondisclosure agreement agreements where applicable. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable laws and regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. In the event that we are compelled to involuntarily disclose any of your information, we will act on the advice of counsel should our records be subpoenaed or otherwise sought through legal means.
When using this Web site, you may opt to complete our registration form and you may create a user name and password. This involves your disclosure of contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
If you do not want your nonpublic personal information disclosed to nonaffiliated third parties, you may “opt out” of those disclosures, meaning that you may tell us not to make those disclosures (other than those disclosures permitted by law even if you do opt out). If you opt out, we will not disclose this information to nonaffiliated third parties to independently market products or services to you, but we may include their offers in billing statements and other routine communications that we send you in connection with servicing your business relationship with us. To opt out, simply reply by electronic mail to ChiefPrivacyOfficer@autopartsnetwork.com and type “opt out” in the subject line of the email. Once you opt out, there is no need to do so again for the same business relationship. You may also telephone us at 954-439-3299 to opt out.
You also have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. For example, by using this information we can provide you with newsletters, updates, and e-mails regarding matters which are relevant and useful to you.
We are the sole owner of the information collected on our site. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
Orders
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. Additionally, if you so choose, you may receive updates from our site.
Application Forms
If you apply for any of our products or those of our affiliates or simply request information regarding products promoted on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, credit card number and sometimes your Social Security number. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you.
Social Security Numbers
Although we attempt to do so on a strictly necessary basis, we do, at times, require your social security number in furtherance of providing services. When you enter your social security number on our registration order form, application form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Surveys or Contests
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
This information is used to notify contest winners, track traffic, personalize user experience and to keep our customers up to date regarding company and industry news.
We sometimes use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or contests. They are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice to refuse.
Tell-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

Our e-mail will contain an easy opportunity for your friend to contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
