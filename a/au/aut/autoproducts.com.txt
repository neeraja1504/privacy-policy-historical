Information That Is Automatically Collected
When you access AutoProducts.com, we and our third-party partners and service providers may automatically collect certain information from your device or web-browser about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other data collecting and tracking technologies, to help us understand how our users use AutoProducts.com and to target advertising messages to you.

This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information, unless expressed consent has been given.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Cookies are small files that many websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users' own devices or computers.

To manage our automatic data collection, we, and our third-party partners and service providers, may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) and other tracking mechanisms on pages on AutoProducts.com, in videos, or in emails we send to you. Web beacons are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to AutoProducts.com, analyzing how users navigate around AutoProducts.com, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.

This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those third parties.
"Do Not Track” Signals. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit.
