The data will not be shared, sold, rented or distributed to any other party for any reason.
The only exception to this is if AuthorityLoophole.com is sold to a third-party, at which time data may be transferred to the new owner.

Collected Information - Involuntary
The only information collected involuntarily from all visitors is basic geographic, referral, on-site navigation patterns and IP information for the purpose of tracking our website traffic statistics. We use this data in order to improve our website & user experience, as well as measuring the effectiveness of our advertising & marketing efforts.
Data is not evaluated on a "user by user" basis, but rather in the aggregate on a mass scale. We look at the overall patterns based on the statistical information collected from thousands of visitors.
The data is collected (and stored) by our preferred & reputable traffic analysis service. The data is stored securely and is not publicly available. Only AuthorityLoophole.com (ownership & staff) can access this statistical data, without exception.
This data is collected through the use of a simple javascript script on each page of AuthorityLoophole.com, and does not interfere with or affect the user's internet browsing program whatsoever.
AuthorityLoophole.com does NOT use spyware, adware, viruses, trojans or otherwise any invasive, involuntary methods to increase incoming traffic, or otherwise for any other purpose.
If you have any concerns or questions about using our website, or our statistical tracking practices, please contact us here.
