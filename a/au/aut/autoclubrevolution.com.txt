We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this Web Site and improving and adding to our existing products, services and events.

We collect the information you give us when you use our Web Site. Information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include your name, email address, phone number, home address, birth date, and credit card information.
You may use our Web Site to contact us and if you do so we will ask for your name and e-mail address. This information will only be used to respond to your query and will, provided we do not have any need to retain the information for any other legitimate purpose, be deleted as soon as we have dealt with your query.
We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes are received, we will use third party software to fix them.

We ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will process that data.
