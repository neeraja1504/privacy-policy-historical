As a fully internet based company which provides web services to the public, AWSB is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following to fully understand our practices regarding the use of your personal information. By using the Site, you consent to the data practices described herein.
This policy applies specifically to your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other individually identifiable information which we collect from our users.
What We Collect
“AWSB” general policy is to only collect individually identifiable information that is absolutely necessary for the transaction or useful for our own internal operations. During the registration process and creation of an account, for accountability purposes, we do require a user’s full name, e-mail address, telephone contact, residential or office address, date of birth, gender, occupation and Identity Card/Passport number.
We record the e-mail addresses and messages of those who post messages, photographs, communications and comments or feedback on the Site, or who communicate with us via e-mail.
We also record aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, information volunteered by users and merchants, such as survey information and/or Site registration data, and the e-mail address of merchants, buyers, sellers and bidders on the Site.
We will also track certain particulars about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), browser type, access times, the pages you visit and your IP address. Many sites automatically collect this information using widely available site web statistical tools.
If you choose to bid, buy or sell on our Site, we collect information about your bidding, buying and selling behaviour.
We also collect your credit cards details and billing address (if applicable).
Cookies
We use cookies on certain pages of our Site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. Most cookies are “session cookies”, meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.
We let the advertisers on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not AWSB’s Privacy Policy. Other companies do not have access to our cookies, and we do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the other companies.

We do not sell, lease or share our customer or member lists to other parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personally identifiable information (e.g. e-mail, name, address, telephone number, Identity Card number) is not transferred to the third party. We may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you e-mail or postal mail, provide customer support or arrange for deliveries. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to us, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.
Collection of photocopy of Identity Card/Passport (where applicable)
Where applicable, AWSB may require a photocopy or faxed copy of your Identity Card/Passport before you can access to or use certain services on the Site.
This Site is a site where the identities of a member are important. This helps reduce fraud between members and enhance credibility.
AWSB assures all members that photocopies and details of Identity Card/Passport are kept securely by us and will never be used for marketing purposes or disclosed or given to any third party by electronic means or print, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

While participating in the Community Section or other public areas, we advise you against giving out personally identifiable information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal or harmful purposes.
