This policy may be updated as technology changes or the law requires, so please check back periodically. If you continue to visit this website and use the services made available to you after such changes, you hereby acknowledge, agree to, and provide your consent to the changes.

Personally Identifiable Information
The only personally identifiable information that NYIAS collects and stores is the information that you have chosen to provide through optional, voluntary submissions. We may collect personal identification information in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when users visit our site, click on various links on the site, register on the site, place an order, subscribe to an electronic communication, contact NYIAS via an email address provided in a hyperlink, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site or through communications
NYIAS uses the personally identifiable information primarily for the following purposes:
To process a request made by you to receive our electronic newsletters;
To participate in our message boards or forums;
To permit participation in polls and surveys;
To complete any other transaction or service requested by you.
To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our websites and provide other administrative services.
To notify you about a material change to this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, if necessary.
To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of NYIAS or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.
To track and analyze nonidentifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
In the event of a corporate restructuring (such as, a sale, merger or other asset transfer), we may share your Personal Information with a third party.
If NYIAS collects your personally identifiable information for one of the purposes described above, it may store such information on its servers or in one (or more) of its databases. If you do not want NYIAS to use and store your information in accordance with this policy, please do not submit any personally identifiable information to NYIAS.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not sell or rent personal identification information to others.  We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business, this site or administer activities on our behalf, such as distribution of newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your permission.
Providing Personal Data to Others
We may disclose your personal data relating to transactions with the New York International Automobile Show to our executives, financial services, insurers, affiliated companies, professional advisors. Except as specified in our Privacy Policy, New York International Auto Show does not divulge any personal data information about an individual user to a third party.
Non-personally Identifiable Information
NYIAS also collects non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our websites. This information is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.  We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
Information New York International Auto Show gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites: This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because New York International Auto Show derives revenue from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.
NYIAS uses your non-personally identifiable information to manage its websites. NYIAS may analyze the data about visits to the websites to make them more accessible and interesting. NYIAS may share that data with third parties, usually to provide services for NYIAS associated with the maintenance of the websites.
How NYIAS Uses Optional Voluntary Information
We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)
We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. NYIAS gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.
Virtual Garage/Forums policy
Users of the site’s Virtual Garage and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.
Polling
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. NYIAS may use a system to “tag” users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
Surveys
NYIAS may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
Usage tracking
NYIAS tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. NYIAS does break down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser).
NYIAS may track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
