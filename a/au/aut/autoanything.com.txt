AutoAnything's Lower Price Guarantee
You will never pay more for any product at AutoAnything–guaranteed!
If you happen to find the same product at a lower price, we will refund the difference - plus $1.00 - promptly.
And, to show our commitment to you, you have 1 FULL Year of price protection from the date of your purchase.
Price match for products you would like to purchase
If you would like to purchase a product from AutoAnything and you see it advertised at a lower price somewhere else, contact our Auto Accessory Specialists toll-free at (800) 874-8888. We will review your request and place your order for the lower price.
Please note: Processing your order at the lower match price is done at the discretion of AutoAnything and is subject to evaluation using the terms and conditions below.
Processing your order at the lower match price is done at the discretion of AutoAnything and is subject to evaluation using the terms and conditions below.
Price match for products you have already purchased
Email us at customerservice@autoanything.com, providing the lower price, where you found it and the date you purchased the item from us. We will look into your order and process your refund. You will receive confirmation of the refund by email within 1-2 business days.
Processing your order at the lower match price is done at the discretion of AutoAnything and is subject to evaluation using the terms and conditions below.
Terms and conditions
Price comparison includes merchandise selling price plus equivalent shipping method, handling charges, and sales tax. The item also needs to be the identical product and in new and unused condition. The item needs to be in stock and available for purchase from an authorized dealer and not a pricing error. Excludes rebates, liquidations, auction sites such as Ebay, and employee discounts. Price match discounts cannot be combined with AutoAnything promotional offers.
Expedited shipping offers and orders shipped outside of the Unites States or Territories may not be eligible for price matching. AutoAnything reserves the right to limit the amount of price match requests per customer.
On rare occasions, erroneous price or availability listings may appear on this site or independently operated affiliate sites. While we apologize for the inconvenience such an error may cause, AutoAnything reserves the right to correct inaccuracies at any time, with or without notice, and update any related orders. We also reserve the right not to price match against any erroneous price listing on this site or any other site. For more information on site errors and corrections, please see our full terms and conditions.
Save up to 40%
At AutoAnything you can save up to 40% off list price every day. More often than not, "List Price" is the suggested retail price of a product as set by the manufacturer or supplier. In the very few cases where the manufacturer or supplier has not provided a suggested retail price, the "List Price" represents either 1 - the manufacturer's suggested retail price for a comparable product; 2 - an approximate price formulated using standard wholesale/retail markups for this particular type of product; 3 - the "Comparison Price" for the same or comparable product as advertised by at least one other vendor.
The "List Price" is not necessarily the lowest price and often can be higher than the actual price at which the product is commonly being sold or offered. "You Save" on our site is arrived at by deducting our price from "List Price" and in some cases may not equate to your actual savings since retail prices available to you may vary.
Please keep in mind, however, the assurance of AutoAnything's 1-Year Low Price Guarantee - find it anywhere else for less and we'll beat that price, for up to one year from the date of your purchase.

This is AutoAnything.com's ("AutoAnything.com") online privacy policy ("Policy"). This policy applies only to activities AutoAnything.com engages in on its website and does not apply to AutoAnything.com activities that are "offline" or unrelated to the website. AutoAnything.com collects certain anonymous data regarding the usage of the website. This information does not personally identify users, by itself or in combination with other information, and is gathered to improve the performance of the website. The anonymous data collected by the AutoAnything.com website can include information such as the type of browser you are using, browsing patterns, originating web pages, number of visits to AutoAnything.com, vehicle selections, items viewed, pages viewed, and the length of the visit to the website.

In addition, if a purchase is made, we collect credit card information, billing and shipping address, other customer information, vehicle information, information regarding prior purchases, and information concerning the dollar amount of the purchase, the date of the purchase, and the specific items purchased. This information is collectively referred to as "personally identifiable information." This information can be gathered when feedback or e-mails are sent to AutoAnything.com, when you register for services, when you voluntarily post information in chat rooms, blogs, message boards or other public forums on AutoAnything.com, when you make purchases via the website, or when you enter information in the checkout process but do not complete your checkout. In all such cases you have the option of providing us with personally identifiable information.

Safe & Secure Shopping
The AutoAnything Security Guarantee protects you while you shop at AutoAnything so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at AutoAnything will be safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at AutoAnything. We have processed more than 500,000 problem free orders. AutoAnything servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, and Apple's Safari's browser. This ensures that only AutoAnything can read your personal information. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. We will, however, transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
After you click on the "checkout" button, be sure that the website's URL always begins with https://www.autoanything.com/
The "s" in "https://" at the beginning of the URL means you are logging into a secure page. If the URL does not begin with https, you are not on an AutoAnything page.
AutoAnything has also obtained a digital certificate from Network Solutions, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secured portion of our site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an AutoAnything Web server, not to an unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered for an account at AutoAnything on the "Log-In / Quick Checkout" page. Please keep this password confidential. No representative of AutoAnything will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect.
