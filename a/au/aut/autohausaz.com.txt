Auto Parts Shopping Where Your Privacy and Security are Guaranteed
Your privacy and security are highly respected and carefully safeguarded at AutohausAZ. We value our relationship with you and appreciate the trust you put in us by providing requested information.
We know how scary it can be to give information over the Internet. You can be rest assured that AutohausAZ is firmly committed to protecting the privacy and security of all your communications with us. We do not provide any personal identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose other than as described in this Privacy Policy. Any information you provide in your secure member profile or during the process of submitting a parts request or order is used only to improve our service to you.
Our Privacy & Security Commitment To You:
Information Collection and Use
AutohausAZ.com is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any outside parties, except as outlined in this Policy. We collect information from our customers to prepare parts quotes, process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations and order status updates. Information collected may include your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone number(s), email address and payment information. Please be sure to enable email from Autohausaz.com email addresses so you are able to receive confirmations of your orders and responses to any questions you send to us.
We require you to submit an email address and password for logging into your secure member area. To safeguard your login information, we ask that you select a security question and answer. DO NOT share your login information or security information with anyone. If you elect to receive our newsletter/special promotions emails, your contact information will be used for the delivery of these items.
Your member profile asks you only for very basic contact information. This contact information is used to respond to your requests and to uniquely identify you, your preferences and your cars. You are encouraged to keep your information up-to-date via the links on the "My Autohaus" and "Car Care" drop-down menus. This will save you time on all your future requests and orders.
Car information is used only for the purpose of locating the correct part numbers for any custom quote requests and to verify the accuracy of your orders to ensure you receive the right parts for your car. You may update your vehicle information on the Edit Saved Vehicles link on the Car Care drop-down menu.
Opt-In/Opt-Out Choice
AutohausAZ does NOT do any mass/junk emailings. Your email address is strictly used to respond to your requests and send you information on periodic specials or news. You may elect to opt-in or opt-out of periodic emailings from AutohausAZ by emailing or calling to let us know your personal preferences. Or you can update your preferences by selecting Update Personal Profile from the My Autohaus drop-down menu.
Security
AutohausAZ takes precautions to protect its customers' information. When you submit sensitive information to us, your information is protected both online and offline.
Our site provides you with THE HIGHEST available technology for ensuring maximum security in data transmittal by using Extended Validation SSL (secure socket layer) and 256-bit encrypted security for all activity when you're logged into My Autohaus (including updating profile data, placing and tracking orders, etc.). Contact information (like your email address, phone number, shipping address) and credit card information is used only for the purpose of processing and shipping your auto parts orders. The most sensitive portion of your credit card information, the 3-digit CVV code, is never stored in our system and must be re-entered each time you place an order.
In addition to the highest encryption technology, AutohausAZ contracts with an outside party, McAfee Secure (formerly HackerSafe), to test our website daily to ensure all confidential information is safe from hackers and that AutohausAZ meets all current PCI security payment card industry standards. McAfee Secure helps protect you from identity theft and credit card fraud. The live McAfee Secure mark appears only when a website meets the McAfee Secure standards.
We further stand behind our commitment to your privacy and security by complying with all BBBOnline Reliability and Accreditation Program requirements for integrity, dependability and customer service response.
