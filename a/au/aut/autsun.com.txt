We respect your privacy
When you purchase products from AUTSUN.COM or register with us for any services, you have the option of receiving e-mails regarding updates about special offers, new products, and new services including any significant upgrades from AUTSUN.COM or from our marketing partners. In time, we will allow you to choose exactly the kind of information you wish to receive from us.
We are also bound to cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. We may share non-personal, non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our marketing partners, advertisers or other third-parties for research and advertising purposes. In other words, we will not tell our marketing partners that you purchased a specific product, but we may tell them how many customers purchased that product.
How do we use "cookies"?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to identify you in case you have visited us earlier and to store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them.
In summary, we respect the privacy of our customers completely. We use the information we collect on the store to enhance your overall shopping experience. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
Go ahead and have a great time shopping at AUTSUN.COM.
