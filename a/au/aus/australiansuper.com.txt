Privacy Policy | AustralianSuper
1. Introduction – AustralianSuper respects your privacy
The following is information about AustralianSuper’s Privacy Policy and the way in which AustralianSuper has implemented the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988.
Protecting your personal information is important to us, and is required by law. The Privacy Act determines that we must handle your personal information in accordance with a set of Australian Privacy Principles.
2. What personal information is collected and held by AustralianSuper?
We collect the following kinds of personal information: your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, your Tax File Number (TFN), the names of your beneficiaries and employment details including salary information.
In some situations we may collect information about your health, including medical information.
3. How does AustralianSuper collect and hold personal information?
Personal information is generally collected directly from you or through your employer, adviser, previous superannuation fund, or other representative authorised by you. Our Privacy Collection Statement can be read here.
Health information is collected from you or your employer, adviser, other insurer, or other representative authorised by you and is provided to us or to our insurers. If required, we obtain independent medical reports directly from your medical practitioner(s).
Where AustralianSuper collects your personal information from a third party, it is that third party’s responsibility to notify you about the disclosure of your personal information to us.
In some instances you will provide us with the personal information of other individuals (such as your nominated beneficiaries). If this happens, it is your responsibility to: (a) tell these individuals that you have provided their details to AustralianSuper and (b) provide them with a copy of AustralianSuper’s Privacy Collection Statement and Privacy Policy.
For employment candidates, AustralianSuper collects your personal information including employment history and other information during the recruitment process either directly from you or from recruiters.
For non-members, the way AustralianSuper collects your personal information will depend on the type of service or information you require from us. Typically, we will collect your personal information directly from you if you are a non-member.
Personal information including health information is held and stored by us and/or our administrator. Our insurers will also hold and store personal and health information in accordance with their own privacy policy.
Once your details have been recorded by our administrator, your original application is securely stored based on the following application method:
paper applications are held at our administrator’s document storage facility on our behalf
online applications are stored within our secure electronic network.
Within AustralianSuper and our administrator, access to your information is restricted to staff who require the information to administer your account and provide information and services to you. A system of passwords and different levels of access is used to protect the information held on the system.
You may choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym when interacting with AustralianSuper, unless it is impracticable for AustralianSuper to deal with you without you identifying yourself.
4. What are the purposes for which AustralianSuper collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information?
The personal information we collect will be used by AustralianSuper and its staff to:
open and administer your super and insurance accounts, and keep you informed about your super and insurance and opportunities available to you as a Fund member
ensure you’re eligible for products and services (including insurance)
help you combine your super accounts and check if you have lost super (when you ask us to)
provide financial education
help improve our products and services
undertake market research, member data analysis and direct marketing activities
manage and resolve complaints made
report information required by law or regulations
perform any other appropriate related functions.
For employment candidates, AustralianSuper collects your personal information for recruitment purposes, to manage your employment application and, if you are successfully placed in a position at AustralianSuper, your ongoing employment.
For non-members, we will only collect the personal information necessary for us to provide the relevant service or information that you require from us. For example, if you attend an AustralianSuper event, we may collect the following kinds of personal information from you so that we can manage your attendance at the event: your name, address, email address and phone number.
If AustralianSuper can’t collect your personal information from you it may be difficult to perform the activities listed above.
If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information to our insurers, they may not be able to provide you with the insurance cover you are seeking, or complete their assessment of your insurance-related matters.
5. Why does AustralianSuper ask you to nominate your dependants for death benefits?
You are asked to advise AustralianSuper of the names and addresses of the persons who you would like to receive your superannuation in the event of your death. This information assists us to distribute your death benefit fairly to your dependants or to your legal personal representative (which means the executor or administrator of your estate). You can make a “non-binding” or “binding” nomination.
If you make a non-binding nomination, we will take your wishes into account, but will also look at all your dependants at the date of your death. Advising us about your relationship with the persons you nominate is not required for a non-binding nomination if you consider this to be an unreasonably intrusive request.
If you make a binding nomination, we will pay your death benefit in accordance with your wishes, so long as your nomination is valid. We need to know the nature of your relationship with the persons you nominate in order to determine whether your nomination is valid. As such, you will need to advise us about your relationship with the persons you nominate in order to make a binding nomination.
6. To whom does AustralianSuper disclose personal information?
We will only share your personal information:
with any third party on specific matters if you have consented to the disclosure
as required by law or regulations, by Courts/Tribunals, or Government or regulatory bodies/authorities
with service providers/third parties that we need to deal with for the purposes described in section 4 above including: our administrator, insurers, your employer, mail houses, independent consultants and market research companies, auditors, actuaries and lawyers, web hosting companies, web and application developers, online calculator providers, our Member Direct platform partners, other superannuation, pension and investment fund trustees or administrators if you transfer your investment to another fund, and other organisations for the purposes described in section 4 above.
Where you provide your personal details for the purpose of online data verification, our third party service provider will use your details for this purpose.  Your information will be subject to an information match request in relation to relevant official record holder information and a corresponding information match result will be provided via the use of third party systems.
If you die while you are an AustralianSuper member, AustralianSuper may share details about your super and insurance with your dependants and legal personal representative (which means the executor or administrator of your estate) as appropriate. The information we share may include the names of your nominated beneficiaries, your account balance and any insurance amount payable.
In the event that you claim an insurance benefit for either Total and Permanent Disablement or Income Protection (Temporary Disablement):
the relevant insurer may collect personal information from or about you and may provide your personal information to AustralianSuper and our administrator, to assist with the assessment and administration of the insurance claim
the insurers may also pass information to claims investigators, medical practitioners, reinsurers, insurance reference bureaus and certain organisations to whom they outsource some functions.  This will be set out in the relevant insurer’s privacy statement.
If your insurance claim is declined and you take legal action or complain to an external dispute resolution body, AustralianSuper and our service providers must, on request, provide your personal details and information about your health to legal representatives of AustralianSuper and the insurer, officers of the  Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) and Court officials.
For employment candidates, AustralianSuper may disclose your personal information to referees, recruiters and employment screening service providers for the purposes of considering your application for employment.
