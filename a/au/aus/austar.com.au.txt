National Privacy Principles
Foxtel is committed to protecting your personal information. We comply with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Act 1988. The NPPs regulate the way that organisations can collect, use, keep secure and disclose personal information. It also gives individuals the right to know what information an organisation holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong.
What information do we collect and why?
The type of information we collect from you will depend on what products and services you use. Generally we collect personal information directly from you, for example when you subscribe to a Foxtel service over the telephone. We may collect personal information about you from a third party for the purpose of marketing our products and services. When you browse this website, we do not collect your personal information. Sometimes, we collect personal information that you choose to give us via online forms or by email, for example when you ask to be on an email list. We only use personal information collected via our website for the purposes for which it was given to us.
When you set up a Foxtel account or become a Foxtel customer you will need to provide certain details so that we can establish and manage your customer account. This includes information such as your name, contact details and information for identification purposes. Foxtel may also request your credit card or bank account details and information to help us assess your credit application where this is relevant. We may also require information about your premises in order to assist with the installation of Foxtel’s services.
Foxtel may offer third party products or services and we may collect information about you in order to provide you with the products, services or information requested.
Use of information
Foxtel may use your information for purposes which you would reasonably expect, such as managing your account, billing, contacting you (including about your Equipment or to confirm any instructions that you give to us) or providing customer support. Foxtel also collects and uses information about your use of our services for monitoring and evaluation purposes so that we can improve and enhance our products and services.
Foxtel may use your information to notify you about new services or promotions from time to time. If at any stage you no longer wish to receive these communications from Foxtel you can contact us to let us know.
What information do we disclose?
We may disclose information where you would reasonably expect us to do so, when you have consented or where the disclosure is for an activity related to the purpose for which your information was collected. For example, Foxtel may provide your information to organisations associated with the provision of Foxtel’s services, such as TV channel providers, for marketing and analysis purposes.
Foxtel may disclose your personal information to a credit reporting agency for the purpose of assessing your credit application and maintaining a credit information file about you. The disclosures will include information relating to your credit application including identifying information about you, the fact you have applied for credit (and the amount). We may also subsequently disclose information about your credit relationship with us to a credit reporting agency.
Foxtel may disclose your personal information to government agencies for the purpose of investigating and resolving disputes or complaints concerning your use of our services. Foxtel will not disclose your personal information to any third parties, other than those who are contracted to us to keep the information confidential. We use contractors to perform certain services on our behalf, for example the installation and servicing of Equipment, customer service support, sales activities, and for mailing purposes.
There may be some exceptional circumstances for disclosing your information, such as when there are grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, or for law enforcement purposes.
Security and quality of your information
We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored securely.
