How does APA use cookies?
The APA website uses “cookies” to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a website page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a website server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
No personal information is ever stored in a APA cookie even if you have entered your name or email address on other parts of the website.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The cookie tells the website server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize APA pages, or register with a APA website or services, a cookie helps APA recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same APA website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the APA features that you customized.
To protect our visitors, cookies do not save payment or credit card information. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the APA services or website you visit.
