2. Data subjects

3. Security has the highest priority
Security has the highest priority, according to the Austrian Airlines AG creed. This creed most certainly also applies to the handling of personal data in our company.
You entrust us with much of your personal data, whether in the course booking a flight, checking-in or ordering our newsletter. It is an important concern for us that we handle your personal data with the greatest care and protect your privacy. Data protection is taken into account in our business processes at all times.
By using your austrian.com profile you agree to this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to the appearance of this website. The pages in this website may contain links directing you to other providers both within and out of Austrian Airlines AG, to which this Privacy Policy does not apply. Austrian Airlines does not undertake any liability for the content of other websites and providers. Please note that different data protection regulations apply when you leave this website.
We use the services of selected data processors for the technical and organisational implementation of our website. These are contractually obliged to process the obtained personal data solely according to our instructions.
4. Registration at austrian.com
The austrian.com profile enables you to store your personal data with Austrian Airlines AG so that subsequent flight bookings can be processed more quickly and easily.
Registration for an austrian.com profile is voluntary and free of charge, and thus can only take place with your explicit consent. In the event of booking flights, prior registration for an austrian.com profile is only required for special flight purchase conditions, namely ABO and CNR. ABO refers to coupons which are purchased and used for a specific flight route at a specific price and is only available in selected countries. CNR refers to special fares used for corporate clients.
5. Types of data
Users may provide the following personal data during registration:
title, first name, surname,
date of birth,
e-mail address, contact address (street, town and postcode), telephone number,
frequent flyer programme,
meal preference (requested menu),
preferred departure airport,
preferred language and
credit card data.
For registration, it is only compulsory to provide an e-mail address and a password.
In addition, registered users of the austrian.com profile have the option of providing the title, first name, surname and e-mail address of those travelling with them. In such cases, the user is obliged to obtain the consent of the people travelling with them and ensure the lawful transfer of personal data to Austrian Airlines AG.
If you enter data about people travelling with you during registration, please note that you must have the required power of representation to do so and you must be authorised to store their personal data in your austrian.com profile.
Every user of the austrian.com profile is able to amend or delete the personal data they have disclosed or subsequently change or cancel the booking of services and flights.
Please note that your passenger data is stored independently of you having an austrian.com profile. In principle, the retention period is three years, unless other statutory or legitimate interests prevent the erasure of such data.
6. Purposes of your austrian.com profile and of data processing
The austrian.com profile is designed to make Austrian Airlines AG online services easier and more convenient to use. This includes:
a simplified flight booking process,
the use of additional booking services, such as seat reservations, online check-in, in-flight entertainment, etc.,
managing flight bookings, booking changes or cancellations,
taking advantage of offers from the Lufthansa Group and our partner companies (i.e. other airlines with which Austrian Airlines cooperates) to help us provide you with further offers, and
optional personalised information, offers and advertising.
6.1. Booking flights

title, first name, surname,
date of birth,
e-mail address, contact address (street, town and postcode), telephone number,

Irrespective of the travel destination, the following personal data may or must be given:

your specific service requests (e.g. meal preferences, transport assistance, accompanying assistance, etc.)
Visa data
We only process your personal data in order to fulfil the carriage contract, to issue your desired flight ticket and to send you a booking confirmation. In addition, we process your personal booking data solely on the basis of legal provisions or with your consent. If you provide us with any personal health information when booking your flights so that we can provide you with the relevant assistance in accordance with your medical needs, this data will only be processed for the provision of services and/or shared with third parties (e.g. airports, security checks, etc.) for the provision of services. Any medical data entered for the provision of services is not stored in your austrian.com profile.
If you use other services on our website relating to the flight (e.g. downloading e-Journals or using pre-flight shopping), the personal data collected is only processed for the performance of the contract.
If you carry out the purchase of a flight ticket not only for yourself but also for a person travelling with you, please note that you must have the relevant power to represent.
Please note that your passenger data is stored independently of you having an austrian.com profile. In principle, the retention period is three years, unless other legal or legitimate interests prevent the erasure of such data.
6.2. Online check-in
When you use online check-in, we process the following personal data about you:
name and booking code
contact details (e-mail address, telephone number)
your specific service requests (e.g. meal preference, transport assistance, accompanying assistance, etc.)
We only process your personal data for the performance of the carriage contract. Please note that your passenger and check-in data is stored independently of you having an austrian.com profile. In principle, the retention period is three years, unless other legal or legitimate interests prevent the erasure of such data.
6.3. Managing flight bookings
You have the option of personally managing your flights in your austrian.com profile under the heading “My bookings”. You can thus view current flight bookings, and change or cancel them in compliance with the conditions of carriage. You can also view completed or cancelled flight bookings in your profile, or look for individual flights using our search function by entering the booking reference. This gives you the option of getting an overview of your booking history.
In principle, your booking history goes back three years. Older flight bookings are deleted automatically after three years, unless other legal or legitimate interests prevent deletion of such data.
6.4. Optional: Personalised information, offers and advertising
If you have explicitly consented to the analysis of your personal data and the receipt of communications from Austrian Airlines AG, you will receive personalised information, offers and advertising from Austrian Airlines AG via e-mail, SMS, messenger services and telephone.
By registering for an austrian.com profile, you may give your consent to allow Austrian Airlines AG to analyse your consumption and usage behaviour in order to provide you with personalised information and offers which are relevant to you and customised in accordance with your personal preferences. Analysis takes place by combining all your consumption and usage data that is legally processed by Austrian Airlines AG and other companies of the Lufthansa Group in customer profiles (e.g. Lufthansa ID or Miles & More programme). Your personal analysis data is only processed within the Lufthansa Group and is not sold to third parties.
The term “analyse” is considered to mean that the Lufthansa Group uses the aggregated consumption and usage data, and calculates probabilities with the help of automated analysis models, which form the basis for selecting recommendations and offers that suit your interests.
By analysing your consumption and usage behaviour, we make personalised recommendations, e.g. your next travel destination, arrange additional services (ancillary services such as FlyNet on board, rental car offers or other offers relating to your trip) based on your personal preferences, and provide you with information about services which are of interest to you within the scope of pre-flight, post-flight and push messages, via e-mail, SMS and messenger services. In addition to offers and information from Austrian Airlines AG, the personalised messages also include offers and information from the Lufthansa Group and our partner airlines.
Conducting this analysis enables Lufthansa Group companies to develop specific processes on their websites, with results customised to your personal interests. This may result, for instance, in a simplified booking process with your data appearing already pre-completed in the booking form, or you receiving user-specific information before, during and after a flight trip with Austrian Airlines AG, e.g. gate changes, recommendations for specific flights, information on baggage conditions and promotional and non-promotional offers for services from the Lufthansa Group (e.g. seat reservations or Business Class upgrades). In addition, we analyse your click behaviour as part of electronic communications (e.g. whether you have opened the electronic communication and when).
The menu preferences, additional services for health reasons, passport data or payment data provided in your austrian.com profile or in the course of a booking are processed solely for the performance of the contract on the basis of explicit consent or statutory obligation. They are not processed for analytical purposes.
You can revoke your consent to the analysis of your personal data at any time without giving reasons. You can still use your austrian.com profile without any restrictions. If you also wish to erase your austrian.com profile, please note the further information under the section “Erasing and deactivating your austrian.com profile”.
7. Linking a frequent flyer programme
You can add a frequent flyer programme offered by our partner airlines to your austrian.com profile during or after the registration process. You can find out who our partner airlines are during or after registration by using the drop-down menu. If you link a frequent flyer programme to your profile, your frequent flyer PIN number is also processed in addition to the aforementioned personal data outlined under “Types of data”.
Austrian Airlines AG is the co-publisher of the Miles & More programme. If you are also a member of the Miles & More programme, we ask you to take into account that your austrian.com profile is currently not linked and synchronised with your Miles & More account. This means that you must give or revoke consent to the processing of personal data or electronic communication separately in your austrian.com profile and in your Miles & More account. We therefore request that you consult the data protection information for Miles & More GmbH.
8. Electronic communication
If you have given your consent during the registration process, you will receive information, offers, customer satisfaction surveys and newsletters, including from partner companies, relating to the subject of travel from Austrian Airlines AG by e-mail, SMS, messenger services and telephone.
You will only receive electronic communications in connection with your austrian.com profile if you have consented to the analysis of your data under the section “Personalised information, offers and advertising”.
In your austrian.com profile, you can also revoke your consent to receive electronic communications for individual areas (e.g. only e-mail communication or only telephone communication). In addition, you can revoke your consent at any time in any e-mail or other electronic communication by clicking on the “Unsubscribe function”. The use of your austrian.com profile will not be affected or restricted in any way by unsubscribing from the newsletter.
9. Transfer of personal data to third parties
The personal data you disclosed in your austrian.com profile when successfully booking a flight will only be shared with third parties (e.g. operating airlines, airports, etc.) for the performance of contractual obligations.
The transmission of personal data to domestic and foreign courts, authorities or other state institutions will only be carried out in accordance with enforceable legal requirements.
10. Legitimate interests
If we process your data in our legitimate interests, in addition to the purposes stated above, this means the following:
To claim, defend or enforce legal claims,
For the transparency and further development of business processes subject to the stated retention periods.
11. Review of payment transactions
Austrian Airlines AG reviews payment transactions in connection with flight bookings to prevent fraud and other improper use. For this purpose, Austrian Airlines AG uses both internal and external resources. If specific fraudulent activities are detected, Austrian Airlines AG reserves the right to share information, including personal data, with other companies within the Lufthansa Group.
