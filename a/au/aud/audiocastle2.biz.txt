_Privacy Policy  _
The purpose of the AudioCastle Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that we collect, how we use that information and the ways listeners can control how that information is used or shared. The entire policy can be found below. To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key items.
You have significant control over the information that is shared with other AudioCastle users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile:
• We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes without your permission.
• Information that you post in our community and through our social networking features is available to members of the public.
• We collect information about the tracks played on AudioCastle to make sure artists and copyright owners get paid. We must report listening information to copyright licensing agencies. These reports contain aggregated data only, and do not identify individual listeners.
• We collect information about the stations, tracks and artists you listen to, thumb-up, thumb-down or bookmark, and the information you provide about yourself, to personalize your AudioCastle experience through suggestions of music, artists and other content you may enjoy, as well as advertisements and social networking features. This information is publicly available, unless your profile is marked private.
• Anyone can search for, and listen to, stations that you create on AudioCastle. If your profile is private, then other people can find one of your stations in a search, but your profile will not be linked to that station; however, if someone enters your entire email address into our search system, they will be able to see a list of all the stations created under that email address.
This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the AudioCastle Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that we collect, how we use and share this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared.

The types of information we collect
There are several areas where you can submit information to us, and some features that automatically collect information from the listeners of our Service and visitors to our website.

Automatic Data Collection
Listening Activity: AudioCastle keeps track of your listening activity. AudioCastle uses software that is designed to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties for the tracks you hear. This software identifies and counts the tracks you have accessed. AudioCastle also collects information about stations, artists and tracks you have listened to or in which you have expressed an interest for advertising and social networking features.
Service partners: When you access the Service through a service partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address), so that we can identify which of our service partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Service.
Information about your computer or device: We may also collect information about the computer, mobile or other devices you use to access and listen to the Service. For example, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device.
• Tracking technology: We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, and other tracking technology to help us manage and track your interaction with AudioCastle Services. These technologies collect non-personally identifiable..
