Audiogon may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. Audiogon may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Audiogon, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We use Stripe as a payment service. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services.

You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy.
Use of Cookies
The Audiogon website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Audiogon pages, or register with Audiogon site or services, a cookie helps Audiogon to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Audiogon website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Audiogon features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept of decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Audiogon services or websites you visit.
How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the Audiogon Websites. Audiogon engages in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting" or “tracking”), through which information collected about the pages you visit on Audiogon is used to display ads for Audiogon products or services on third-party websites. This information may uniquely identify a browser but is not personally identifiable.
Online Behavioral Advertising
Audiogon may use third-party online advertising companies to provide you with Audiogon advertisements that may be relevant to your interests, as determined by your activity on Audiogon and non-Audiogon websites. This type of ad customization is known as "online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. These advertising companies may use cookies to understand your interests based on, for example, pages visited and browsing patterns on Audiogon and non-Audiogon websites.
Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving online behavioral advertisements from third-party advertising companies that Audiogon uses to serve these interest-based ads. Because Audiogon participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program, we have adopted the use of the DAA’s Advertising Options Icon (AdChoices) on these ads for the purpose of allowing users the ability to opt-out of this form of tracking. You may click on the AdChoices icon to opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads that are served to you based on your browsing behavior on Audiogon websites. Please note that opting out through the AdChoices icon will only affect ads served to you based on your behavior on Audiogon websites, and does not prevent you from receiving other Audiogon advertising. You may also opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads directly at our website using this link:  AdChoices. Opting out through the Audiogon website, as opposed to using the AdChoices icon, means the data about your behaviors on Audiogon websites won’t be used by third party advertising companies to serve you interest-based ads.
The methods of both collecting data for the purpose of serving behaviorally-targeted ads and recording your opt-out are done at the individual computer browser level and are based on browser cookies. If you clear your cookies or use a different browser or computer, you will need to re-submit your preference to the specified third-party advertising companies.
