Privacy Policy
It is our sincere hope at Audi Canada that what is now a purely digital relationship will evolve into a more personal one. A relationship built on trust. Our policy on privacy is simple and unwavering. We would also remind you that audi.ca is a private, copyrighted site and intended solely for personal use. And now that we've taken care of the business that our attorneys advised us had to be stated, let's get back to something more exciting, more promising: Audi and you.

These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. Some of our websites may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests.

Our use of "cookie" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.

We may use "pixel tags", which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed;the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see A word on "Cookies") on the computer previously placed by that server.
