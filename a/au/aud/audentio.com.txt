Privacy Policy | Audentio Design
Audentio Design of Audentio.com operates this web site. Audentio Design regards the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the service that we offer to our users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Registration Data - We use Registration Data to give you access to our forums and purchase script. We also use Registration Data to send you information about our company and service and to keep you informed of enhancements and complementary products in which you might be interested. You may choose to stop receiving future communications from us. Please see the Opt-Out and Discontinue Section below.
Cookies - Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a web site if you do so. We use cookies to store your personal preferences and settings on our site. Advertisers that display ads on our site may also use cookies. Audentio Design does not have access to the information obtained from those cookies.
IP Addresses - IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of profile data known as "traffic data" so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Audentio Design will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.
Referers - A Referer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as "traffic data". This information is used by Audentio Design to identify backlink information and tracking. You will not be personally identified from this information.
System Information - System information we collect as part of "traffic data" includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a web site. This information is used by Audentio Design in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.
Sharing of Information - Audentio Design feels strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party period! No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners period! Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Audentio Design will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if Audentio Design is required to do so by law, or (ii) if Audentio Design has the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on Audentio Design, or to protect and defend the rights or property of Audentio Design or another subscriber or to enforce the Terms of Use.
