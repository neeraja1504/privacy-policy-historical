in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us, (iii) for archiving purposes in the
public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with the law in

exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of
legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
