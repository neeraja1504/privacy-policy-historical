What personal information is collected from you
The ApartmentHunterZ.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our website.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your website, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the Vacancy posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to ApartmentHunterZ.com – you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the ApartmentHunterZ.com.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place vacancies or take advantage of the other features of the ApartmentHunterZ.com. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the ApartmentHunterZ.com includes a link to this Privacy Policy.
Tracking Technologies and how they are used
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by apartmenthunterz.com and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers (Google Analytics, LiveChat). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:
To store and sometimes track information about you
To identify and label all «new» vacancies since your last visit to the site
Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site
To enable you to «checklist and compare» vacancies that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing
Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. (See «What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information» for more information on cookies.)

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the «My Profile» link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in.

The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information
Other than the administrator of the ApartmentHunterZ.com or other authorized personnel of the ApartmentHunterZ.com, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ApartmentHunterZ.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the ApartmentHunterZ.com. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ApartmentHunterZ.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us here
