How Information Is Used and Shared

We may use your Personal Information to provide the Apex Online Service, including user support, to you and your school or Sponsoring Organization as well as to improve Apex Online Services. Apex Learning Communications. For users other than students, we may send you communications about our offerings from time to time.

Contact Information. Your contact information may be shared with your teacher, school and Sponsoring Organization. If you enroll in one of the Apex Online Service offerings where the instruction for that offering is provided by an online Apex Learning teacher, your name, email address, school, phone number and state of residence will be shared with your online teacher. Your name and email address will be shared with other students participating in the same section of your Apex Online Service. Also, if you are a student or teacher, we may use your name, contact information, and school information to associate you with your Sponsoring Organization so you can gain access to the relevant Apex Online Service. Legal Requirements. Apex Learning may disclose your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary in order to: (1) comply with any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation, including to comply with any subpoena, warrant, court order, or other legal process to which Apex Learning is subject; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Apex Learning; (3) protect the personal safety of you, other users of Apex Online Services or the public; or (4) to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use for the Apex Learning Websites. Apex Learning cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property, and other rights. We may report suspicious activity to law enforcement for prosecution.  Vendors.   From time to time we may share your Personal Information with third party vendors that we engage to assist us in maintaining, supporting, or providing Apex Online Services.  In such event, we contractually require the vendor to use such Personal Information only as reasonably necessary to perform services for us and to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information.
Business Transfers
Information about Apex Learning Websites users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of Apex Learning.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Privacy
Links to Other Websites. You should be aware that when you are on any Apex Learning Website, you could be directed by links or otherwise to other websites hosted by third parties. We do not endorse those websites. For example, if you "click" a link to a third party site we have listed on one of the pages on the Apex Learning Websites, the "click" takes you off the applicable Apex Learning Websites. Apex Learning is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of any third party websites. Please note that these websites may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.
What You Disclose. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out Personal Information online - for example, via message boards, forums, or chats - that information can be viewed and used by people that you do not know, including but not limited to other students who access the Apex Learning Websites. Apex Learning does not control their use of that information.
Security.  Apex Learning uses various security procedures and practices (including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards) to protect your Personal Information.  No security measure, however, is guaranteed.  Apex Learning does not ensure or warrant the security of any personal or other information you provide to us.  You can help protect your Personal Information by using strong passwords for the Apex Online Services and guarding access to those passwords.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will post the modified Privacy Policy on the Apex Learning Websites with an updated “Revision Date”.  If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will provide a prominent notice (e.g., on our home page).  Any revisions will be effective upon posting except that we will give you or your Sponsoring Organization choices before using any of your Personal Information collected under a prior version of the Privacy Policy in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy terms under which the information was initially provided.
