IN APP SHARING OF CUSTOMIZED APP DATA
The Service, among other things, permits Users (the "Customizing User") to create a customized version of the Service (the "User Customized App") which is accessible to Users (the "Customized Users") that are invited or otherwise selected by the Customizing User to download the User Customized App. Each Customizing User would have access and a right to use most, if not all, of the information, photographs, video, audio and other material and data that you provide through the use of the User Customized App, some of which is likely to be or include personally identifiable information (the "Customized App Data").

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.
Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.
If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
