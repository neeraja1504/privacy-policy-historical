What data do we collect?
Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site (www.applegate.co.uk). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use the site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with the site.
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.
Details of transactions you carry out through the site and of the fulfilment of your orders.
Details of your visits to the site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.
We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our clients. We may use cookies both so that we can remember information you have entered into our site, and so potentially represent that to you, and in order that we can understand how you interact with out site.
Telephone calls are recorded for compliance, quality and staff training purposes.
Where information is supplied to us through third parties, we ensure by contract that GDPR compliant consent exists.
How will we use your data?
We use your information to deliver our services, such as processing details given to raise quotation requests or searching for terms, in order to provide you quotes or return results.
We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services. For example, understanding why some quote requests receive more responses than others.
We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, identifying buying patterns allowed us to launch Marketplace Intelligence Reports as an additional service to clients.
We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyse data about your visits to our sites to do things such as optimise product design.
We use information we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification of a quote request to which you’ve been invited, and we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.
Marketing
We may, with your consent, send you marketing information. This may arise from information that you’ve previously provided to us or to a supplier of ours indicating that you would like to receive such information.
You can update your preferences at any time, either using the ‘unsubscribe’ link provided on all marketing emails, by logging into your Applegate account or by contacting us directly by phone or email.
Sharing data outside of Applegate
We may share your information as required to deliver our services. For example, where a quote request is raised, the details of the requirements are shared with potential suppliers of those products or services.
We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons who process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use Amazon Web Services to host our database and software.
We use external providers to facilitate payments. This means that Applegate does not store your payment details, these are always handled by our specialist providers.
For legal reasons. For example, where we are required to meet any applicable law, regulation or enforceable government request.
What are your data protection rights?

Please note that if you request us to restrict processing your information, we may have to suspend the operation of your account and/or the products and services we provide to you.

Please note that the right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons: to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information; to comply with a legal obligation; for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest; for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. We may also refuse to comply with a request for erasure if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive, taking into account whether the request is repetitive in nature. Please note that if you request us to delete your personal information, we may have to suspend the operation of your account and/or the products and services we provide to you.
Request personal information provided in a portable format
You have a right to data portability.

If you would like to request the personal information provided to us in a portable format, please contact us at enquiries@applegate.co.uk.
Object to the processing of your personal information
You have a right to object to the processing of your personal information. You have a right to object to us processing your personal information (and to request us to restrict processing), for the purposes described, in what we do with the data, unless we can demonstrate compelling and legitimate grounds for the processing, which may override your own interests or where we need to process your information to investigate and protect us or others from legal claims.
