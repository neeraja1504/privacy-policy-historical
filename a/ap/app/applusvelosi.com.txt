merger or similar restructuring. Should such a sale or transfer occur, We will use
reasonable efforts to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal data

   Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims; and
   Deal with any complaints regarding the services.
We will delete your personal data when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any
information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, We will
put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.
