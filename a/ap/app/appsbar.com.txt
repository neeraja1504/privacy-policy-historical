SECURITY
appsbar®  uses secure connections during the transmission of log in, registration and membership information. This means that information collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information, is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your computer and appsbar®  computers.

You can verify that the connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or web site address); for example, the address will change from http://www.appsbar® .com to https://www.appsbar® .com when a secure connection is in place.
