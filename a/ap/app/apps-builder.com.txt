As a rule, this type of information is not collected in order to be associated with specific data subjects and may be used by Paperlit for the purpose of collecting anonymous statistical information on the Website use and check its correct operation.

1.2 Cookies
Cookies are text files sent by the Website to the user’s PC browser. The browser saves information and forwards it on to the Website server when a user accesses the Website the next time.
The Website will use:
(a) session cookies, i.e. cookies that are temporarily stored in the user’s browser ‘cookie’ folder for the full duration of the navigation session;
(b) permanent cookies, i.e. cookies that remain stored in the browser folder for longer periods of time (depending on the duration of each cookie).

The use of permanent cookies is intended to provide users with specific services. For instance, when registration is made with a User ID and a password, users are given the opportunity to choose whether to store this information for it to be used on their next log-ins; this is made by storing a cookie on the user’s PC.
The Website can also be accessed and navigated without cookies. Most browsers accept cookies automatically.
