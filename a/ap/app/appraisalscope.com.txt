Privacy — Mercury Network
This Privacy Policy applies to this Mercury Network website (the “Site”) but it does not apply to other Mercury Network websites, products or services.  You have the right to understand how information about your visit to the Site is collected, used and retained.
We collect and use certain information about your visit to the Site to help improve the Site, for marketing or market research purposes, and to administer the Site.  The information we collect about your visit may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you access the Internet, the date, time and duration of your visit, the pages you viewed on the Site, and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from which you linked directly to the Site.  We may collect, use and retain this information even if we collect no personally identifying information about you.
We may request personally identifiable information about you in order to operate the Site or to provide the services or carry out the transactions you request or authorize.  The personal information collected may include your name, title, company or organization name, company or organization address, e-mail address, and telephone number.  In conjunction with these uses, we may use personal information to improve your experience of the Site, to provide customer service, or to provide important information about the Site or the services or transactions you request or authorize.  Additionally, we may use personal information to provide you information about the Mercury Network or about other Mercury Network products or services.  If we need to contact you about technical or security issues related to a product or service you requested, you can’t “opt out” of those e-mails, as they are essential to your use of the Site.
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, personal information collected from the Site will not be shared beyond Mercury Network, LLC, its parent, affiliates or partners without your consent.
We engage other companies to perform tasks on our behalf, such as server hosting, optimization, and redundant archiving to ensure continuity of service.  We only provide such other companies the information they need to perform those tasks.   In cases where personal information resides offsite, it is subject to limited access, strict confidentiality terms, and/or is encrypted.
We will not disclose personal information except under limited circumstances.  We may disclose personal information collected on the Site if we are required to do so by law, such as pursuant to a lawful summons or subpoena, or a request of an individual acting with appropriate legal authority.  We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Mercury Network, its users, or the public.
If you create a Mercury Network account, you may change your personal information at any time by logging in to the User Management section of the site and clicking on the Users button.  If you would like to review the personal information of yours that we have collected, you may find it at that link or you may contact us at privacy@mercuryvmp.com.  We may ask you to prove your identity before we allow you to review personal information.  We will delete some or all of your personal information at your request, but doing so may make certain features of the Site behave differently.
This Site uses cookies to customize your experience and to otherwise remember information about you so you don’t have to supply it again.  A cookie is a small data string that a web server writes onto your computer hard drive.  Cookies are widely used by websites to customize your experience, improve the sites, and save you time.  You control whether you allow cookies to be used.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but provide a setting that lets you refuse cookies.  You may modify your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may mean you can’t fully experience interactive features of this Site and other websites.
When you have set your browser to issue “do not track” signals or otherwise use another mechanism to provide choice regarding whether to supply information to the Site, we do not override that setting or mechanism.  You may choose to enable a “do not track” setting or mechanism and continue to visit the Site, but the Site may not function in the same way.
Neither Mercury Network, LLC nor its parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries warrant that your use of the Site will be confidential. Mercury Network, LLC and its parent, affiliates or subsidiaries disclaim any liability for harm to you or any other person arising from any alleged breach of confidentiality with respect to your use of the Site.
The Site is a general audience website that does not solicit nor knowingly collect information from children under 13.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  You can tell when the Privacy Policy was last updated by referring to the “last updated” date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.  Your use of the Site constitutes consent to this Privacy Policy and any updates to it.
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Privacy Policy.  You may contact us electronically at privacy@mercuryvmp.com or by U.S. Mail to 5885 Cumming Highway, Suite 108 Box 318, Sugar Hill, GA 30518.
