This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information used on the Company’s Web sites and Services, and how this information may be used.
Cookies
Appointy uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, Appointy’s servers send a cookie to your computer or device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser.

Web Beacons
Appointy may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site or Service tied to the Web beacon. For example, Appointy may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. Appointy uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites, Services and email communications.
Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer our Web sites and Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, Appointy uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites. Appointy also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
Social Media Features and Single Sign-on
The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features. Appointy also allows you to log in to certain of our Web sites and Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Appointy does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Appointy takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Public forums, and customer testimonials
Appointy may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Appointy is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
Appointy posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Appointy obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

Mobile applications
Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Appointy may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Staff”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”). Mobile Applications provided by Appointy may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application. For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.
Mobile Applications may provide Appointy with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Appointy may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). Appointy may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if a User downloads an Appointy Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Appointy, the third-party advertiser may provide Appointy with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Appointy may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.
Customers may configure Appointy Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration. Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application. Appointy may provide updated versions of its Mobile Applications. If your mobile device’s settings permit, those updates will be downloaded and installed automatically on your mobile device. By installing an Appointy Mobile Application on your mobile device, you consent to the downloading and updating of that Mobile Application.
Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application. The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices. The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under Appointy’s Terms Of Use with the Customer or under this Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Service Agreement with Appointy (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to Appointy’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply.
