Applied Materials, Inc., including its subsidiaries (“Applied Materials” or “we”), respect the privacy of our online visitors.

We collect personal information from and about our Website users, both directly when you provide it and automatically while you visit the Websites, as follows:
Personal Information You Provide. “Personal information” is information relating to a directly or indirectly identified, natural person such as, your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, etc.  Through its Websites, Applied Materials may request, or provide an opportunity to submit, personal information in connection with an online feature or service. For instance, we may ask customers, suppliers or job applicants for information necessary to verify eligibility to use a Website service or to facilitate dealings or transactions. While under no obligation to provide us with personal information, you should understand that we will not be able to process your communications with us or render certain services that we offer online without this information.

As you navigate through and interact with our Websites, we collect certain information that is automatically recorded from the computer, smartphone or other electronic device (“device”) you use to visit the site.  This may include information about your equipment and browsing actions, such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, and web pages viewed immediately before and after visiting our Websites, information you search for on our Websites, and other technical data. We use browser Cookies, which are very small data files transferred to your device, to collect information when you direct your browser to our Website; these include Session Cookies, which are deleted when you exit, that enable certain Website features and help us understand how visitors interact with the Website. When you register for one of our web-based services, we may use Persistent Cookies to store information that enables our Websites to remember you on a return visit. These technologies also help us better understand which areas of the Website are of interest to visitors
You can adjust the settings on your Internet Browser to control Cookies. In addition, Applied Materials honors "do-not-track" technology, which enables you to signal your preference concerning the automatic collection of your information. Note that if you disable or refuse Cookies, some parts of our Websites may be inaccessible or not function properly.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
Use of Personal Information (for job applicants, please see section 2 below). We use the personal information you submit on our Websites to meet our legitimate business interests.  This includes responding to your requests, inquiries, or otherwise serve you in ways associated with the circumstances under which you provided the information. We do not use your personal information for Applied Materials’ marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree or opt-in to such usage. Marketing may include sending you communications about our products and services or other communications targeted to your interests. If you do not wish us to use your email address or other contact information for our direct marketing purposes, do not select the opt-in option (if any) in the online form in which we collect your data. If you initially opt-in but change your mind, you can opt-out by: (i) replying to a promotional email we have sent and indicating your preference to unsubscribe; or (ii) sending us an email stating your request to Privacy_Questions@amat.com.
