Apptivo highly respects the privacy of its customers, business partners and employees and recognizes the requirement for appropriate protection and proper management of personal information provided.

Apptivo certifies that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for onward transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability as well as the Supplemental Principles of the Framework.
