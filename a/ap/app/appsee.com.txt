Effective Date: February 21, 2019
Appsee is owned and operated by Shift 6 Ltd., together with its affiliates including Appsee Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Appsee", "we", "our" or "us").
This Privacy Policy applies to data collected, received or used whenever each of Appsee‘s website visitors, or existing/prospective service subscribers (each, a "Visitor" or "Subscriber", respectively, or "you") uses the Appsee SDK and the Appsee SaaS Solution (as defined in our Terms of Use, and further explained below), or otherwise accesses or uses any of Appsee's websites, systems or services (collectively, the "Services").
The Appsee SDK allows Subscribers to record session replays of their end-users’ (“End Users”) use of the Subscribers' mobile applications ("End User Data"), and to upload such End User Data to Appsee’s secured cloud servers. Subscribers are able to analyze such End User Data via the Appsee SaaS Solution – all in accordance with the Terms of Use, Data Processing Agreement, Order Form and this Privacy Policy (collectively – the "Agreement").
To this end, each Subscriber authorizes Appsee to access and process their End User Data on their behalf, as further described below. That said, Subscribers must not provide us with any End User Data which they are not legally authorized to provide us under lawful grounds pursuant to applicable law, required disclosures, and consents. If you do not wish to provide us with your Personal Data or have it processed by us, or do not have the legal grounds to collect, provide and request processing by us of any End User Data, please simply do not enter or register to our Services.
Specifically, this Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Uses
3. Data Location and Retention
4. Data Sharing
5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
6. Communications
7. Data Security
8. Data Subject Rights
9. Children’s Privacy
10. Data Controller/Processor
11. Additional Notices
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and make sure that you fully understand and agree to it. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please discontinue and avoid using our Services.
You are not legally required to provide us with any Personal Data (defined below), but without it we will not be able to provide you with the full range of Services or with the best user experience when using our Services.
We collect data regarding Visitors to our Site, regarding our Subscribers as well as data regarding their End Users. Such data is typically collected and generated through the Visitor’s or Subscriber’s interaction with our Services, through automatic means, directly from such Visitor or Subscriber, or through other third parties.
Specifically, we collect the following categories of data (which, to the extent it relates to an identified or identifiable individual, will be deemed as “Personal Data“):
1. Data automatically collected or generated: When you visit, interact with or use our Services, we may collect or generate certain technical data about you. We collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third party services (as detailed in Section 4 below), including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in Section 5 below). Such data mainly consists of connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as IP addresses, non-identifying data regarding a device, operating system, browser version, locale and language settings used, the cookies and pixels installed on such device and the activity (clicks and other interactions) of Visitors and Subscribers in connection with our Services. Such data does not enable us to learn a person’s true identity or contact details. We mainly use this data to gain a better understanding on how Visitors and Subscribers typically use and interact with our Services; how we could improve their user experience; to optimize our marketing campaigns and ad management; and to optimize the overall performance of our Services.
2. Data received from you: If a Visitor contacts us in any way (such as via e-mail or any contact forms on our Services), we will collect and record such communications and related data, information and usage logs concerning such Visitor (including their identity or contact details, if provided through such communications). Subscribers may provide us with Personal Data such as full name, workplace and position, contact details (such as e-mail, phone and address), account login details (such as usernames and hashed passwords) (collectively, “Account Data“), as well as the name of their mobile application(s)) and any other data you choose to provide when you create a Subscriber account, use our Services or contact us.
Subscribers may provide us additional Account Data such as their billing details, business needs and preferences. To the extent that such data concerns a non-human entity (e.g. the bank account of a company or business), we will not regard it as “Personal Data” and this Privacy Policy shall not apply to it.
Following registration and approval of the Subscriber's account, we collect additional data with respect to the Subscriber's transactions, user activity on our Services, professional and company information available through public sources, and communications with us (such as with our customer and support services).
Data received from our Subscribers about End Users: As described above, Subscribers may use the Services to record and upload End User Data to Appsee’s secured cloud servers, and analyze such End User Data via the Appsee SaaS Solution. This includes:
a. Technical information and aggregated usage data, which may contain the End User's type and version of operation system, usage length, phone model, country, screens visited in the mobile application, touch gestures performed in the mobile application, scrolling activity and any other actions the End User performed during their use of your mobile application.
b. End User's partially-hashed IP address, Appsee-generated Unique User ID, and the Subscriber's generated Unique User ID.
c. Data received via third party integrations, whereas each Subscriber is solely responsible for ensuring the legality and safeguarding of such data (including Personal Data) transferred to or from such integrated services.

In particular, Subscribers must refrain from providing Appsee with any Personal Data of children under the age of 16; any health, financial, or insurance data; or other data which is subject to specific regulatory or statutory protection regimes (including "special category" data under the EU GDPR).
It is each Subscriber's sole responsibility to select the fields and screens which may be analyzed via the Services, and to take into account the sensitivity of the applicable End User Data which may be made available by Subscriber’s End Users in any such field or page and the nature of the Appsee Services .
If you choose to provide us with any Personal Data regarding your End Users, you must receive the End User's explicit consent for such use.

The Services do not track the End User's activity across applications/services that do not use the Services and will not collect any passwords entered to unlock the End User's device.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
If you wish to prevent the use of your mobile device's advertising ID, you may change your device settings to reset such advertising ID (typically, this is available under the "Privacy" or "Ads" section in your device settings).

Our Services are not designed to attract children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children and do not wish to do so. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage so that we can verify that persons under the age of 16 are not using the Services. In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of 16 is using the Services, we will prohibit and block such Subscriber from accessing the Services and will make all efforts to promptly delete any Personal Data stored with us with regard to such Subscriber.

Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “Data Controller”, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “Data Processor”, who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
Appsee is the “Data Controller” of its Visitors and Subscribers’ Personal Data (including Subscribers’ Account Data), and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Appsee is the “Data Processor” of End Users Data processed by Appsee on behalf of the Subscriber, our Customer. In such instances, our Subscriber shall be deemed the “Data Controller” of such data, and Appsee will process such data in accordance with the Subscriber’s reasonable instructions, subject to the terms of our Agreement. The Subscriber will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing, obtaining explicit consents as necessary, and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).
Updates and Amendments: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is so published. We will provide a 30-day prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via the Services. After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.
