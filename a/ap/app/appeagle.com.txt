Privacy Policy
AT APPEAGLE, WE RESPECT AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF VISITORS TO OUR WEBSITE, WWW.APPEAGLE.COM (THE “SITE”), AND OUR CUSTOMERS WHO USE OUR REPRICING PLATFORM, TOOLS AND SERVICES OFFERED ON THE SITE (THE “SERVICE”). APPEAGLE KNOWS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED AND SHARED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU, HOW IT IS USED AND THE SAFEGUARDS WE USE TO PROTECT IT. THIS PRIVACY POLICY (“POLICY”) EXPLAINS HOW WE COLLECT AND USE VISITORS’ AND CUSTOMERS’ INFORMATION AS PART OF OUR SITE AND OUR SERVICE.
Last revision: January 19, 2015
1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE
In this Policy, “personal information” is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person, such as the individual’s name, postal address, email address and telephone number. When You register for the Service, We ask for information such as your name, company name and address, site name, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. If You sign-up for the free trial account, You are not required to enter your credit card information until You decide to continue with a paid plan. Appeagle uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Appeagle’s behalf.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
As is true with most web sites, Appeagle gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally We may connect personal information to data gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service to individual customers. Otherwise We mostly use this information with no connection to individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Site, or track usage of various features within the Site.
3. COOKIES
A “cookie” is a piece of information either stored temporarily (session cookie) or placed on your computer’s hard drive (persistent cookie). The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user, and serve up customized web pages and/or login information to the user’s web browser when revisiting a web page. Cookies help us promptly display the information You need and other information which We consider to be of interest to You. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies We can provide a better web and marketing experience.
When You visit the Site or use the Service, We use “session cookies” to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while You are logged in and to enable Appeagle to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. We also use “persistent cookies” that only We can read and use, to identify You as a Appeagle customer and make it easier for You to log into the Service.
As a user You can accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into most web browsers. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.
4. CLEAR GIFS
Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. If You would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within our marketing emails.
5. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Appeagle may use the personal information and other information We collect about your use of the Service:

Appeagle may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.

For example, when You enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You authorized access.

If You are our customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Appeagle please contact us at privacy@appeagle.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email.
