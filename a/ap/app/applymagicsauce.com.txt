Information we collect from your browser
We collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our website for the purpose of site functionality. This information constitutes standard Apache log data, including the following:
Internet address of connecting client
Time stamp
Request made
Server's response code and number of bytes returned
The "user agent" string identifying the make of client
Your browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics
Information we collect when you connect a third-party platform account
If you log in to our prediction demo using a third-party platform account (e.g. Facebook Connect or Twitter Login), we will also collect social media information that is provided voluntarily by you via the consent dialogue of the relevant third-party platform. This information may include:
Your Facebook userID, as specific to the Apply Magic Sauce application (note: this is not a universal Facebook platform ID). This is stored by us in hashed form
Your Twitter ID. This is stored by us in hashed form
LikeIDs of the Pages you like or follow on Facebook
The text content of your Facebook Posts, comments or Tweets
Any profile information that you have chosen to make public
We do not collect any social media information about you other than what you explicitly consent to share with the Apply Magic Sauce app via the consent dialogue of the relevant third party platform. This website uses Apply Magic Sauce API in order to generate predictions but this API does not store the results of any predictions generated by this website.
Information we collect when you share a file containing your data
The AMS Data Portability Tool allows you to share a file containing digital footprint data for the purpose of generating a prediction. This is an alternative to logging in with a third party platform account. When you select a file, we analyse it client-side (i.e. on your computer) in order to locate and extract only the files that are relevant for the purpose of prediction.
Even if you select a folder containing many files, the only files that we upload to our server are those from which predictions are generated, for example pages.json or tweets.csv.
When you use the AMS prediction demo (by any method) we also generate a unique CamPsych ID for you and show this on screen. This ID does not expire and is not reliant on any external platform resources, ensuring that you can always use it to request deletion of your data, even if you lose access to your Facebook or Twitter account, or if these login methods cease to function.
Information we collect through forms
If you contact us through the contact form on the website, then we will collect and use the information submitted through it, including your email, for the purpose of responding to your enquiry.
If you sign up to use Apply Magic Sauce API, then we will collect and use the information submitted through that form, including your email, for the purpose of account maintenance (required) and for marketing if you have opted in to receive communications from us. You can opt-out of receiving marketing from us at anytime via the unsubscribe link in every email.
Use of Cookies
Cookies provide information regarding the computer used by a visitor. We use cookies on this site to gather information about your computer in order to enhance your experience and enable certain features.
We use self-expiring session cookies for the purpose of maintaining the test session for a given user. We also use them to anonymously match the session with sessions on other websites that are maintained by the University of Cambridge Psychometrics Centre. These websites will state if cookies are used in their respective user consent policies. Session matching merely tells us whether it was likely to be the same person using multiple websites that we manage, without telling us who this person is.
We also use cookies for Google reCAPTCHA, Google Analytics, Facebook Social Plugins and Twitter Social Plugins.
Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our site. Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site.

In order to prevent spambots and protect information sent via our contact form, we use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google. The service determines whether the form was completed by a human being or was the result of misuse, processed automatically by a computer. The service includes sending the IP address to Google and possibly other data if required by Google for reCAPTCHA. For this purpose, your entry is sent and used by Google. We do not store this data for any other purposes. For more information, visit https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.
