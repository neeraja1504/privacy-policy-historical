Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Appcheating collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Appcheating also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://appcheating.com blog posts. Appcheating only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
