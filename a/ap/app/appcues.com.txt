Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
‍
Appcues is committed to protecting the privacy of all its users.
In order to ensure that our customers and users are fully informed of our data handling policies and their rights pertaining to this data, we maintain this page which details our practices around information collected through the Appcues platform.
Last updated: 2018-02-01
Overview
‍
Our approach to data security and privacy includes but is not limited to:
State-of-the-art platform security
At-rest and in-transit encryption of all customer and end-user data
Providing customers with the tools to control the amount of personally-identifiable information (PII) handled by Appcues
Compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Privacy Shield program
Kinds of Information We Collect
‍
Appcues processes four different categories of data, which reflect the different levels of sensitivity in context. However, there are several common traits about how we handle the data, regardless of type:
We never sell this data to third parties. In limited cases, we provide it to third-party services for usage strictly within the Appcues product or business; for example, to provide analytics graphs on the Appcues dashboard.
All data is subject to the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation , in the case it originates from the European Union.
‍
Type 1: End-user PII
This is the most sensitive type of data that Appcues collects. Examples:
Any user profile data passed to Appcues by the customer, using the Appcues.identify() SDK function
Browser information that is collected by default in the Appcues SDK (e.g., OS, device type, browser language, user agent)
Browsing history data that is collected by default in the Appcues SDK (e.g., current page URL, current page title)
We reiterate that like all data we collect, end-user PII is never sold to third parties.
Customers may opt out of browser and browser history information by contacting Appcues Support.
This data is used in the targeting and customization of Appcues content.
‍
Type 2: End-user Appcues Data
This data pertains to how end users are interacting with Appcues content; for example, whether a flow was shown to a given user, whether a user has clicked away a tooltip, etc. This category also includes user responses to in-Appcues forms or surveys.
Though this category usually does not contain PII, we caution that form or survey responses may add PII to this data.
End-user Appcues data is provided to service providers for usage within the Appcues platform. Customers may also configure Appcues to send this data upstream to other services via Segment.
Data in this category is used in the targeting and customization of Appcues content, as well as displaying analytics on the Appcues dashboard.
It is this data stream which is available for CSV download on the Appcues dashboard.
‍
Type 3: Customer PII
Customer PII is collected by the Appcues dashboard, for example the name and email address of each of a customer's team members who are authorized to use the Appcues platform.
Appcues does not store financial data about customers (e.g., credit card information), choosing instead to employ a dedicated payments processor.
Data of this type is used mainly in the Appcues dashboard and editor, and within the Appcues business.
‍
Type 4: Customer Aggregate Data
This category includes customer-wide statistics such as active user count, number of Appcues flows shown, how many Appcues flows are published at a time, etc.
This data does not contain PII.
Data in this category is used mainly in the Appcues dashboard and editor, customer emails, and within the Appcues business.
‍
Security and Compliance
‍
GDPR
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law that regulates the transfer of personal data out of the European Union, that takes effect May 2018. The GDPR enumerates the rights of end users with regards to data collected about them, including the right to view, delete, and/or cease collecting this data.
Compliance with the GDPR is a practical requirement of any data service like Appcues with end users in the European Union. Further, it is the moral duty of data processors to protect the privacy rights of their users.
Appcues is fully and proudly compliant with the GDPR.
More information is available in our Legal section below.
‍
PCI Data Security Standard
Appcues is fully compliant with the PCI Data Security Standard, which regulates the handling and retention of payment data. Appcues does not handle customer payment data directly, instead using a fully PCI DSS compliant payments processor. Appcues is not intended for the handling of end-user payment information.
‍
Encryption
Appcues is committed to the privacy of information as it passes over the network, as well as to preventing unauthorized access to customer or end-user data. We use industry-leading encryption to protect all external traffic in transit (via HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using AES-256 and an automated key rotation system).
‍
Data Retention
End-user and customer data in the Appcues platform is retained indefinitely by default. In the case that customers or individuals request the deletion of their data, Appcues will perform this deletion within seven working days.
Requests for data deletion may be addressed to support@appcues.com.
