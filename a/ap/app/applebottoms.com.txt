Scope of Policy
This policy applies to Apple Bottoms's treatment of personally identifiable information that Apple Bottoms collects through Apple Bottoms's site and when you use Apple Bottoms's services. The policy does not apply to practices of companies whose sites may be linked to Apple Bottoms. For access to the privacy policies of such linked sites please refer to the information provided by such sites at their home pages. Also see the paragraph below under the heading "Hypertext Links".
Information Collection and Use
Apple Bottoms collects personally identifiable information when you request information from Apple Bottoms. On such occasions, Apple Bottoms asks for your name, email address, zip code and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information. Apple Bottoms also receives and records information from server logs from your browser including cookie information relating to pages requested and the like.
Apple Bottoms does not seek to collect such information from persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any such information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 who has provided such information to us, please inform us (through the Web site or telephone number listed above) and we will remove such information from our database as described further below.
In addition, no person (of any age) is required to provide us with the personally identifiable information we request. If you do not wish to provide such information, you are free not to do so. Your provision of requested information to us through our Web site or other means is presumed by us to be voluntary and with your consent to the uses described herein. If after submitting personally identifiable information to us, you wish to "opt-out," please contact us as noted above. Please know that such a decision will not stop advertising or content that is generated prior to the time when we can accomplish the removal of your information. Moreover, if you have previously opted out, but later consent to sharing your information by accepting a third party's marketing offer, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party.
Apple Bottoms uses the information you provide to us, including name, address, credit/debit card numbers and other billing information, to customize advertising and content that we present to you, to contact you concerning specials and new products, to enhance our product offerings, and to facilitate your transactions with third parties. Apple Bottoms will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party except when:
You have been given an opportunity to "opt out" of sharing the information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided;
Apple Bottoms must share the information in order to provide a product or service that you have requested from us, in which case we will demand that any third party we use to fulfill your order agree that it does not have the right to use the personally identifiable information other than to fulfill your request; or
Apple Bottoms is required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure.
You have otherwise consented to provide your information to such third party.

Managing your information
You are entitled to request access to and correction of all your personal data collected by us via this Web site, as well as to require us to delete your data if you no longer want us to process it. You can make such a request or a related inquiry by emailing us or by calling 1-800-637-9594.

Security
Apple Bottoms employs reasonable measures to maintain all personally identifiable information provided by you on computer servers in a controlled and secured environment in an effort to hinder unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure of such information. However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons.
Because of the international nature of the services and products provided by this Web site and the nature of Apple Bottoms's business, personal data may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout Apple Bottoms world-wide (details of which are available on request by emailing or calling us as provided above) for the purposes described above. This may mean that personal data are transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations which protect personal data, such as the United States, where the server for this Web site is located. We use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure of the data you provide to us only to certain staff within Apple Bottoms and its affiliates (i.e. staff whose job it is to process your inquiries and survey answers or otherwise to administer the Web site, and those staff involved in the provision of Apple Bottoms services and products which may be of interest to you) and to require that they process the data only for the purposes identified in this Statement.
