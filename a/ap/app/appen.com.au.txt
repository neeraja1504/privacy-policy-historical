We may collect information from other sources, such as social media platforms that share information about how you interact with our social media content, and any information gathered through these channels will be governed by the privacy settings, policies, and/or procedures of the applicable social media platform, which we strongly encourage you to review.
We will handle any unsolicited information in accordance with law, including destroying or de-identifying such information where we are required to do so.
