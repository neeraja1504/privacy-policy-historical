Last Updated: September 26, 2016
Introduction
Appcelerator, Inc., and its affiliates (“Appcelerator”, “us”, “our” or “we”) are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our developers (“Developers” or “you”) and the end users of their applications (“App Users”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect from you or from your App Users in connection with our website at www.appcelerator.com (the “Site”) and in connection with Appcelerator’s products (collectively, the “Service”). Personal information can include, for example, an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number. Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information collected or received by Appcelerator through your use of the Service. Appcelerator is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page with the date indicated and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
How We Collect Information
Website
When you visit our Site, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses may be logged automatically. We may also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We may use this information to monitor and analyze your use of the Service.
Cookies
Appcelerator uses “cookies” to keep and occasionally track information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate within the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your password if you choose “auto login”, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. We also store your display resolution and whether JavaScript is enabled in your browser to enhance your user experience. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file. However, removing cookies may result in you not being able to take full advantage of the features of the Service. We may feature advertisements served by third party advertisers that deliver cookies to your computer so the advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertisers associate your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to the information collection and use practices of these third party advertisers. You may click on the following link: http://www.networkadvertising.org (or such other URL as may be specified by us from time to time) for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies.
