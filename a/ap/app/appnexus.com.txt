Our cookies and web beacons are set and read for the following purposes:
Personalization of your navigation.  These cookies enable us to recognize you and remember any information you enter during your navigation on our website (such as language choice, country you are browsing from, or browser type). This makes your visit on our website easier as we don't ask you the same information several times during your navigation.
Third party cookies and web beacons may be placed on our website for the following purposes:
Analysis of our website activity.  We use Google Analytics cookies and web beacons to collect information related to our web traffic and to track the number of visitors visiting our website. These are tools that enable us to measure the performance of the navigation on our website and provide you with personalized marketing messages. Your interactions with these cookies and web beacons are governed by the privacy policy of the applicable third party. For more information on the cookies and web beacons used by these third parties, you can refer to their specific privacy statements listed here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.
YOUR CHOICES
European Data Subject Rights
If you are a resident of a country in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of your personal data. We process this data as necessary to further the legitimate interests of our company while ensuring appropriate privacy protections.
As a resident of a country in the EEA, with respect to your personal data you have the right to: (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data, (ii) request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please reach out to us here.
Finally, as a resident of the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data Protection Authority. For contact details of your relevant local Data Protection Authority, please see here.
EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles
If you believe that AppNexus holds information that would allow us to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information about you or that information about you that has been processed in violation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield's Principles or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, please contact us here.
We will seek to provide access to such data, but will not be able to do so when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
Marketing Communications
You may request that we cease sending you any marketing communications (including by email) at any time by notifying us here or following any "unsubscribe" instructions included in any marketing communications which we send to you.
Testimonials
We display testimonials from satisfied clients on the website in addition to other endorsements. We will obtain our client's permission before we place these testimonials on the Website. If you are a client who wishes to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us here.

Global Operations and Privacy Shield
AppNexus is a global company headquartered in the United States with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. If you access appnexus.com please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates in our facilities in the United States and other countries (including in Singapore, Japan, Australia and Brazil where our global affiliates have offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your information.
These countries (including the United States) may not provide an adequate level of data protection for your information (as determined by the European Commission) or have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will, however, ensure that where AppNexus group companies or third party service providers receive information about you outside of the EEA, appropriate protections are in place under European data protection legislation (which includes either Model Clauses or Privacy Shield compliance).
For example, in order to ensure that your information is adequately protected when transferred outside of the EEA, AppNexus has entered into inter-company "model clause" agreements and other adequacy arrangements with other various entities located outside the EEA with whom we share your information. A copy of such agreements is available on request.
Additionally, if we transfer personal information from the European Union to the United States or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. AppNexus has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
For any questions or complaints regarding our compliance with either the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, please contact us here. If AppNexus does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to ICDR/AAA, AppNexus' designated independent dispute resolution provider. Under certain conditions specified by the principles of the EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, respectively, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. AppNexus is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC. If AppNexus shares the personal data of an individual located in the EU or Switzerland with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on AppNexus' behalf, then AppNexus will be liable for that third party's processing of that data in violation of the Principles, unless AppNexus can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
What Happens if this Privacy Statement is Changed?  Check this page for changes. We may change this privacy statement at any time. If we make changes that, in our sole discretion, are material, those changes will not be applied to information collected prior to the date the changes went into effect.
