If you a citizen of the European Union you also have the rights listed below. If you are a California resident, please refer to Section 10 below for more detailed information on your rights under California law.
3.1 European Union Residents
In certain circumstances, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. A summary of each right and how you can exercise it is below. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us. Such requests should include information to allow us to verify your identity (e.g. your name, address, email address or other information reasonably required).
Where we receive your request to exercise one of these rights, we will respond without undue delay within the time required by applicable law. This may be extended in certain circumstances, e.g. where requests are complex or numerous.
We will provide the information free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, e.g. because of their repetitive character. In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request. We will advise you of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.
We may ask for additional information to verify your identity before carrying out a request.
Right to access and/or correct your personal information
You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, and to be provided with a copy of the information (in most circumstances). You also have the right to correct any information we may hold about you that is inaccurate.
Right to restrict use of your personal information
You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:
The processing is unlawful, but you want us to restrict use of the data instead of deleting it;
Where you contest the accuracy of your personal information, the restriction will apply until we have verified the accuracy or corrected your personal information;
We no longer require the personal information for the purposes of processing, but are required to keep it in connection with a legal claim;
You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Right to request deletion of your personal information
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in most circumstances. If you want to opt-out from receiving marketing communications, the best way to do so is to allow us to retain your information with a âdo not contactâ tag so we know not to contact you in the future.
There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal information is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to object to processing of your personal information
You may object to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes.
You may also object to processing of your personal information in cases where we have used legitimate interests as the basis for processing. In such cases, we will stop processing your personal information until we verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Right to data portability
In most cases, you have the right to receive all personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data controller, where technically feasible.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
If you object to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to complain to the data protection authority in the country where you reside, where you work, or where an alleged infringement of data protection laws has taken place.
4. International Transfers
GetApp may transfer your personal information to other Gartner group companies, including Gartner Digital Markets, or suppliers outside your home jurisdiction. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.
We may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Policy on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.
5. Retention Periods
We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations require us to retain it.
In general terms, this will mean that your personal information will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:
the period required by tax and company laws and regulations; and
as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims. This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws.
6. Choices About Your Information

10. California Privacy Rights
California law requires us to provide California residents with additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your âpersonal informationâ (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ)).
Categories of personal information we collect. Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of information we collect from and about users. Below are the categories of personal information we collect:
Identifiers (such as name and title, contact details, and company name);
Internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage);
Inference data about you; and
Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
Use of categories of personal information. We may disclose the categories of personal information identified above for our operational purposes where the use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose for which it was collected or processed, or for another compatible operational purpose.
Sale of Personal Information. The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that âsellâ personal information. Based on the definition of âsellâ under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months (including that we do not âsellâ the personal information of minors under 16 years of age). We do share certain information as set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Policy, and allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as explained in our Cookie Policy.
Individual Rights. California law may provide you with certain rights and permit you to request the following:
Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you and for compliance with applicable law. If you ask us to delete certain information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
If would like to exercise any of these rights, please email us at GDMprivacy@gartner.com or send your written request to Data Protection Counsel, Americas, Gartner, 1201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA. You will be required to verify your identify before we fulfill your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
Subject to certain limits under California Civil Code Â§ 1798.83, California residents may request certain information regarding our disclosure of information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us as specified at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals
Do Not Track (âDNTâ) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We do not recognize or respond to browser-related DNT signals, as the industry is currently working toward a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, please click here.
11. Nevada Privacy Rights
Nevada law requires us to provide certain Nevada consumers the ability to opt out of the âsaleâ of âpersonally identifiable informationâ as such terms are defined under Nevada law. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing GDMprivacy@gartner.com. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.
