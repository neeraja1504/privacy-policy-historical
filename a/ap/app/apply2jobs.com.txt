ASP Privacy Statement
Our ASP Privacy Statement applies strictly to the transmission of personally identifiable information ("PII") received by VirtualEdge Corporation through its hosted workforce acquisition software (E*TRACK System™), supplied directly by our customers or by the visitors of our customer career centers for employment consideration. Visitors to VirtualEdge.com should refer to the VirtualEdge.com Privacy Statement.
VirtualEdge Corporation abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. VirtualEdge operates as a data processor for our ETRACK customers. Our customers are the controllers of the data collected and maintained. Users involved in recruiting activities supported by ETRACK communicate directly with our customers, not VirtualEdge. VirtualEdge provides its customers with the option to disclose their relationship with us by providing notice to their users of E*TRACK. VirtualEdge only maintains the information our customers have asked us to process related to the recruitment process.
This ASP Privacy Statement does not reflect the privacy practices of our customers and VirtualEdge is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices. VirtualEdge does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does VirtualEdge review its customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy.
Use of Information
As an ASP, VirtualEdge operates as a data processor for our customers. Our customers are the data collectors and controllers of the data. Users involved in recruiting activities supported by E*TRACK communicate directly with our customers, not VirtualEdge.
VirtualEdge maintains only the information our customers have requested we process as required by their recruitment process. It is the VirtualEdge customers' responsibility to ensure that the data they collect can be legally collected in the country of origin. The VirtualEdge customer is responsible for providing its employees and employment candidates the appropriate level of notification that PII is being collected and maintained. VirtualEdge provides its customers with the option to disclose notification of collection and maintenance of PII to employment candidates using E*TRACK.
Onward Transfer
VirtualEdge may engage other companies and agents to perform tasks on behalf of VirtualEdge (i.e., resume processing). If VirtualEdge discloses information of our customers to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, VirtualEdge will make certain that the third party has agreed to abide by this policy as well as VirtualEdge data security guidelines, or can otherwise assure satisfactory protection of PII. Satisfactory protection may be achieved by entering into written agreements with third parties requiring third parties to provide, minimally, the same level of privacy protection as is required by this policy and VirtualEdge data security guidelines.
Access to Collected Information
As an ASP, VirtualEdge collects PII on behalf of another company. To request access to or correction of this information, please contact the company to which you provided it. E*TRACK provides our customers access to all of the information processed on their behalf and provides for the processing of any requested corrections.
Standard Privacy Practices
Security
VirtualEdge is committed to the highest level of security for the information we process and store. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and to ensure the appropriate use of information, we have implemented physical, logical, and administrative procedures to protect and secure the information we process and maintain.
While we use encryption and firewall technology to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of the information collected is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII. All VirtualEdge employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure information collected is protected.

Notification of Change
If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use PII in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of a prominent notice for 30 days. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
Disclaimer
We may disclose PII when required by law or in the good faith belief that disclosure is required to comply with legal mandate, enforce the terms of usage of VirtualEdge.com, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of VirtualEdge, users of E*TRACK and the public. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure of information, VirtualEdge will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat implemented safeguards or use your PII for improper purposes.
