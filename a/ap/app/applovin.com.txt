AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “AppLovin”) is a mobile advertising company that provides application developers with a platform to deliver advertising to their consumers. Our technology enables our partners to show mobile application users more relevant advertising that is based on users’ interest in applications. In order to provide these services, we collect and use certain information about user activity in mobile applications.
The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our advertising platform (“Services”) and our corporate website at www.applovin.com (“Site”), as well as your choices related to that information.

Information Collection and Use
If you are a consumer that downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services, we may collect certain device information including the following:
Device make, model and operating system;
Device properties related to screen size & orientation, audio volume and battery, device memory usage;
Carrier;

Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services; and
Identifier for advertisers (IDFA).
This device information may be collected across mobile apps and websites over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we use that combined information to offer the Services. This type of information may include transactional data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations. We may also collect certain types of information automatically, including through the use of Cookies. You can control or disable the use of cookies at the individual browser level on your device.
Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services, improve them, and research and develop new ones.
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive with third parties for the following purposes:
With service providers that perform services on our behalf;
With our affiliates;
To provide our clients with the Services, such as to deliver relevant advertising, and to provide attribution;
For analytics and research purposes;
In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes;
To protect our or a third party’s legal rights or to defend against a legal claim; and
As part of a business transfer such as a merger, acquisition, or at bankruptcy.
Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers
We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products.
Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally Identifiable Information Only).
We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad.
Service providers and other partners
We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.
