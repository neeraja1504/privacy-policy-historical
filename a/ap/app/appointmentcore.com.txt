How We Use Your Personal Information
Whether we receive your personal information directly from you or from a third party source, we will only use your personal information in connection with our ordinary professional activities. These activities may include:
Internal Use. All submitted PII is stored in our database and may be archived elsewhere. Our system administrators and support personnel have access to PII that is processed by AppointmentCore.

For example, PII is used to resolve technical support cases, to conduct marketing analysis, to create user profiles, to provide services or complete transactions users request, to anticipate and resolve issues with the AppointmentCore’s products and services, and to create and inform you of new products and services that better meet your needs. We may communicate with users at any of the contact points provided to us for any of the aforementioned purposes. Please note that AppointmentCore will never initiate contact with our users’ customers.
Cookies. When you visit our Site or click on one of our advertisements on other properties (e.g. Facebook) we send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other device.

When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences. We use persistent, session, and flash cookies, and may use other types of cookies in the future.
Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to understand the services that you use and how you use them. Any information collected from you, including PII, is anonymous and unlinked.

How We Share Your Personal Information
Any sharing or transferring of your personal information is done in accordance with applicable data protection laws, and we will take appropriate safeguards to ensure its integrity and protection.
To Provide Products, Services, and Information. As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase using our Site. We may provide information to third party vendors who assist us in processing and completing transactions requested by you in accordance with the products and services we offer. For example, we may use third party vendors to help host our website, send out e-mail updates about the Site, process payments, and assist with marketing services. These service providers may have access to your PII for a limited time. When third parties have access to your PII, we implement reasonable protections to limit their use of such information to the service they provide, and prohibit such vendors from using or disclosing your PII for any other purpose.

However, AppointmentCore is a global technology company, and you agree and acknowledge by using our Site that AppointmentCore may transmit your PII outside of the United States. Please note if you are not a U.S. citizen that the privacy laws of the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your country.

Newsletters. If you sign-up to receive newsletters or other communications from us, we use your e-mail address and other relevant data to provide the newsletters and other communications to you. You can always opt-out of receiving e-mail newsletters or advertisements by using the opt-out feature provided within the e-mail communications.
Advertising. We use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by AppointmentCore. We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites.
Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm. We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or legal process. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to AppointmentCore, the Site, or our customers. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Sites to a third party, we may transfer your personal information to the new owner to be used consistent with this Policy. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy.
Access and Control of Your Personal Information
In addition to your rights under applicable data protection legislation and where we are permitted or required by applicable law and regulation and by our professional obligations, we will provide you, upon request, with a copy of your personal information. We will also correct any errors that you identify to us.
You can access, change, or update your PII by emailing us at privacy@appointmentcore.com. We will implement any requested changes as soon as we reasonably can, subject to reasonable limitations, such as the need to verify your identity.
You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from AppointmentCore by using the unsubscribe feature located in our e-mails, or by emailing us at privacy@appointmentcore.com.
Your personal information will be deleted when it is no longer reasonably required for our ordinary professional activities or you withdraw your consent (where applicable), provided that we are not legally required or otherwise permitted to continue to hold such data.
If you close your account, we will no longer use your online account information or share it with third parties. We may, however, retain a copy of the information for archival purposes and to avoid identity theft or fraud.
Security of Your Personal Information
We implement and maintain reasonable security controls to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and access to your PII. We protect your data with several layers of protocols including password-protection, firewalls, and employing SSL encryption. We regularly audit our system to protect any data you store on our servers from possible vulnerabilities. We may also utilize secure technology to transfer data provided by users and additional measures in the processing of sensitive PII. Additionally, to protect your data, we have in place confidentiality agreements with our employees, various service providers, and third parties. While we have taken multiple measures to protect and secure your data, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of your information may not be accessed, destroyed, or disclosed by way of the unauthorized acts of others. Please take care to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails you send to us through our Site are not encrypted.
