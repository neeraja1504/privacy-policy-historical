Information You Share on the Site. Because appbackr maintains a community­oriented
Marketplace, it is important that buyers have sufficient information about developers in order
to consider purchases. Also, the Company’s Apps involve sharing apps which necessitate the
collection and sharing of certain information about which apps you have stored, your location,
and other personal information. Certain Application Information is required in order to
participate in and receive certain Services but other Application Information you may provide
to us is optional. You are welcome to share as much information about yourself as you think is
necessary and appropriate. We will display on the Site any Application Information you
provide to us and we may also display certain iTunes Information and information from
Google Play and other such stores as well.
We may provide Account holders on our Site with the opportunity to communicate with you
through an in­browser or in­App message box. If you respond to any in­browser or in­App
message, you may be providing the recipient your email address or other personally
identifiable information such as your WhatsApp or Twitter identification. Through this
communication, Account holders may request additional information from you. Such sharing
of information is entirely your choice, and you share this information at your own discretion.
How You Can Update or Delete Your Information. You can see, review, and change most of
your Personal Information by registering as a member on the Site. You must promptly update
your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your
account and remove your Application Information from view as soon as reasonably possible,
in accordance with applicable law. We do retain Personal Information from closed accounts to
comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreements, and take other actions
otherwise permitted by law.
Information Disclosed to Third Parties. This document addresses only the use and disclosure
of information we collect from and/or about you. If you disclose your information to others,
including to other appbackr members, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of
the information you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties,

Changes to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to revision from time to time,
and revisions will apply prospectively and not retroactively. We will post any revised version of
the Privacy Policy on this page. If we make any material changes to it, we will also send you
notice thereof to the last email address you have provided to us. Any amended Privacy Policy
will be effective: thirty (30) calendar days after posting for then­current members, and upon
posting for any persons who create an Account after such posting. Any changes to this
Privacy Policy may affect our use or disclosure of Personal Information collected prior to the
changes. If you do not agree to any of the changes, you must notify us prior to the effective
date of the changes that you wish to terminate your appbackr membership. Continued use of
