LEGAL STATEMENT
Policy and guidelines for use of marks in advertising, promotion and display
Apple Vacations and its affiliates have the exclusive rights to use the APPLE VACATIONS service mark and other Apple Vacations marks and logos. Under the trademark laws, the Apple Vacations companies must prevent the use of their names and marks in ways that could give customers and potential customers the mistaken impression that an Apple Vacations company owns or is affiliated with an agency using its marks. Apple Vacations (and trademark law) allow the "fair use" of Apple Vacations marks and logos by agencies, in a truthful, informational way in accordance with the rules provided here. Please adhere to the following specific rules when using Apple Vacations names and marks in promotions on Internet web sites and in print advertisements.
General Rules
All uses of the APPLE VACATIONS name or any Apple Vacations mark must relate solely to Apple Vacations travel packages and not to the agencies selling them. Agencies that sell Apple Vacations packages may not refer to themselves in any context as "Apple Vacations travel agents" or to their businesses as "official Apple Vacations travel agencies."
Travel agencies may only use signage, window displays, or point of purchase items employing the Apple Vacations name or any Apple Vacations mark (a) as provided by Apple Vacations, or (b) as approved in writing by Apple Vacations.
No one may copy any content appearing in any Apple Vacations website, brochure, or advertising without express written permission from Apple Vacations.

Internet Web Sites
No one may use the name Apple Vacations or any Apple Vacations mark (or anything confusingly similar) as part of an Internet domain name.
No agency may display the APPLE VACATIONS mark by itself on a web site without prior written approval.
Travel agencies may use an Apple Vacations mark in a website in the following ways: a. An Apple Vacations mark may be used as part of a statement such as "We sell Apple Vacations travel packages," so long as all of the words in the sentence are of a similar size. b. An Apple Vacations mark may be used in conjunction with links, schedules, product descriptions, or order forms, expressly referring to the sale of Apple Vacations travel products by the agency. c. In any case where the Apple Vacations name or mark is used, the name of the travel agency must appear on the same screen, above the Apple Vacations name or mark, and in a size at least 125% of the size of the Apple Vacations name or mark used.
Print Advertising

As discussed above, truthful, informational statements are permitted in promotional materials and advertisements, such as, "We sell Apple Vacations travel packages."
