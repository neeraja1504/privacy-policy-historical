Purpose of this privacy notice
This Notice aims to give you information on how APITS collects and processes your personal data, whether you have provided it to us directly or whether we’ve obtained it from other people and organisations.
We may provide you with more specific privacy information where we collect information from you for certain specific purposes. If we do so, you should still refer to this Notice so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data and how we may use it in future. This privacy notice adds to the other notices and is not intended to replace them.
Controller
APITS is the data controller and responsible for your personal data (when we refer to “ APITS ”, " we ", " us " or " our " in this Notice, that’s who we’re talking about).
We have appointed a data privacy manager who is in charge of answering questions in relation to this Notice. If you have any questions about it or if you want to use any of your legal rights, please contact the data privacy manager using the details set out below.

Changes to the privacy notice and your duty to inform us of changes
This Notice was last updated on 30 April 2018.
The data protection law in the UK will change on 25 May 2018 when GDPR comes into force. Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data) until then as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes.
It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
2. The data we collect about you
“ Personal data ” means any information about an individual, held by a data controller, from which the controller can identify a specific, living person. It does not include data about a living person that the controller can’t identify.
Some personal data falls into “ Special Categories ” under the GDPR and are given greater protection. These include any personal data revealing your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, and information about your health, as well as genetic and biometric data. Information about criminal convictions and offences is also treated differently from ordinary personal data under the GDPR.
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. The personal data we collect will depend on the relationship you have with APITS.
If you are:
An employee of APITS, someone working with us under a contract for services, or someone who applies for employment or work with us, we will provide you with specific privacy information regarding the data we hold on you and ask for your consent to use your personal data. We will also collect the following information on you:
Identity Data including first name, last name, title, job title, role or similar identifier, and gender, as well as proof of identity and your right to work in the UK.
Contact Data which may include your address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data in order to provide pay, benefits and conduct other financial transactions with you.
A business contact, including persons who supply us with goods (including hiring things to us) or services and any contacts at a company or other organisation which does so, and customers (including contacts at companies or other organisations) to whom we supply services, we may collect the following types of data on you:
Identity Data includes first name, last name, title, job title, role or similar identifier, and gender.
Contact Data includes your work address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data if we supply or purchase goods and services to or from you as an individual (including some sole traders and partnerships), we may record and retain details of those transactions.
Someone who attends, or obtains tickets or registers to attend, one of our exhibitions related to overseas property:

This may include statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature or evaluate the level of interest in a service, property or feature of our website.

Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
5. Disclosures of your personal data
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We expect all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party data processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes, in accordance with our instructions and with the data protection legislation.
6. International transfers
If you enquire about property located outside the European Economic Area (“ EEA ”) – for example, in Florida - your personal data will be provided to the advertiser. We may also from time to time offer information, products or services from partners outside the EEA in relation to properties in their country or location. In each case, this will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ).
In many cases where you submit an enquiry about products, services or properties offered by a commercial partner (such as an estate agent or private seller) outside of the EEA, we may be unable to ensure a similar degree of protection for your personal data as exists within the EEA. In these situations, we transmit your personal data directly to the advertiser or partner at your request and on your behalf . Separately, we may also use the data provided by you for our own business purposes, as set out in this Privacy Notice.
In limited cases, we may act as a data controller in determining whether to transmit and process your data outside of the EEA. In these situations, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data as it would enjoy within the EEA by implementing at least one of the following safeguards:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
Where we share data with partner organisations outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. Not all our partners are members of Privacy Shield, so we may use model contracts instead. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
Please contact samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
7. Data security
We use secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8. Data retention
How long will you use my personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
9. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to find out more about these rights:
Request access to your personal data
Request correction of your personal data
Request erasure of your personal data
Object to processing of your personal data
Request restriction of processing your personal data
Request transfer of your personal data
Right to withdraw consent
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
