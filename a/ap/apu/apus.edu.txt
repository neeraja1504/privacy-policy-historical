Online privacy is important to us. As such, it is the policy of American Public University System, its members, American Public University (“APU”) and American Military University (“AMU”), and American Public Education, Inc.

This privacy policy describes our online collection and use of personal information about you at our websites, blogs, message boards, social media pages, and mobile applications that link to this policy (collectively the “Online Services”) (the privacy policy will be accessible in the settings tab of our mobile applications). We may also offer websites and mobile applications that have their own privacy policies.  Please refer to the privacy policy associated with the mobile application or website you are using for the governing privacy policy. For the purposes of this policy, personal information is defined as information, or a combination of information types, that could reasonably allow you to be identified.

In some cases, students who are enrolling in a course or program or buying books, or other visitors utilizing online commerce functions to purchase goods or services, may be required to provide credit card information for billing purposes. If making a request for Admissions or Transfer Credit, students may also be required to provide information related to prior academic history, employment, or military service. If a student chooses not to provide this personal information, he/she may be unable to receive some of the services we offer.

Each manner in which we collect personal information about you identified above occurs only when you voluntarily provide information to us.
We may offer through our Online Services public forums, newsfeeds, blogs, message boards, social media pages and similar tools (collectively, “Interactive Features”). The posts or comments you make on Interactive Features may be public and viewed by others. As such, you should use care before posting information about yourself, including personal information, online. You acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to Interactive Features.  Except where required by applicable law, we assume no obligation to remove personal information from postings to Interactive Features and you disclose any personal information in your postings at your own risk.
