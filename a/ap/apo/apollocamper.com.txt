Privacy Policy - Apollo Motorhome Holidays
Version 2 - Last updated April 2019
Apollo Motorhome Holidays Pty Ltd ACN 051 584 153 in Australia and its related bodies corporate (as that term is defined in section 50 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)), in Australia, New Zealand and the United States (referred to in this policy as we, us, our ) recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information we collect about you.
The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), Australian Privacy Principles and registered privacy codes (in Australia) and the Privacy Act of 1993 (in New Zealand) govern the way in which we must manage your personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information.
You should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are updated on any changes.
Personal Information is any information or opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is stored in a material form or not.
We only collect personal information that is directly related to, or reasonably necessary for, our functions and activities. The types of personal information we usually collect, how we collect such personal information, how we hold your personal information, the purposes for collection and use and to whom we disclose your personal information are detailed below.
Wherever practicable, we will enable you to deal with us anonymously or pseudonymously, however, in many cases it is not practicable to interact in this way.
If you choose not to provide some of your personal information, this may prevent us from providing our services or goods to you or limit our ability to provide the level of service you would normally expect from us.
What kind of Personal Information do we collect?
The service that you use or the goods you purchase will determine exactly what information we collect from you. The personal information we collect from you may include your:
full name;
home or mailing address;
contact telephone number(s);
contact facsimile number(s);
date of birth;
gender;
marital status and family details (next of kin);
country of Residence;
driver's licence number and state/country of origin (which may include a scan of your physical driver’s licence);
frequent traveller program number;
identification details (e.g. student, pensioner card);
vehicle preference;
financial information, such as your bank account, credit card number(s) and expiry date(s);
passport details;
email address;
occupation;
employment information, including company name, position and employee number;
signature;
contact details of individuals who can provide professional references and other information required in the Cash Qualification process;

sales details including date, place of vehicle purchase, amount of purchase price, and details of vehicle purchased;
information with respect to vehicle purchase financing;
preferences such as baby seat requirements, GPS requests, table and chair orders, etc; and
vehicle damage circumstances and details.
Personal information will generally be collected directly from you when you rent or purchase a vehicle from us and through the use of any of our standard forms, our dealings with you over the internet, via email, or through a telephone conversation. The service that you use or the goods you purchase will determine how we collect personal information from you.
It is our usual practice to collect personal information about you directly from you (or from your authorised representative). This is done when we make a record of the personal information that is provided to us when you (or your representatives):
visit one of our websites;
fill out a hard copy or digital form;
give information to our sales representatives;
provide a testimonial, survey response or are part of a focus group;
apply for membership to or sign on for any service that we provide;
order or purchase goods or services from us;
post a review or comment on one of our websites or social media pages or post a rating or review or other user generated content on one of our websites or apps;
enter one of our competitions (or competitions run by our partners or associates);
provide goods or services to us;
participate in product promotional activities;
click on one of our advertisements or offers (by using technology such as ‘cookies’);
interact with us in relation to employment services, human resource management, and other corporate service functions;
communicate with us (including e-mail and telephone) for security, dispute resolution and training purposes and when we operate video and audio surveillance devices in our premises;
make a complaint or legal/ liability claims against us;
sign documents on behalf of your employer, or an entity to whom you provide services, being an entity or person who is one of our suppliers or customers; and/or
contact us by telephone, mail, email, online or by any digital form or social media.
There may, however, be some instances where personal information about you will be collected indirectly because it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect personal information directly from you or your authorised representative. For example we may collect personal information through a travel agent, a corporate program or through one of our partner programs. We will usually notify you about these instances in advance, or where that is not possible, as soon as reasonably practicable after the information has been collected.
We may collect personal information from our business or related entities and affiliates which collected your information in a different country (e.g. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the USA).
We may also collect information about you by accessing data from other sources and then analysing that data with the information that we already hold about you in order to learn more about your preferences and interests.
