First-party cookies
The Site receives and stores certain types of non-personal information whenever you interact with it. Like many other websites, the Site uses " cookies " to save selected data about your internet session, such as IP address and referring page. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are stored by your Web browser and enable the provision of personalised site features. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its producer. However, because cookies may allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's essential features, it is recommended that you leave them turned on.
Third-party cookies
Like many other websites, the Site uses Google Analytics to monitor and analyse internet traffic. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use, which are stored via cookies on client computers. The information thereby generated is used to create reports that are of interest to webmasters. For example, data about the frequency of visits to the website, the particular pages viewed, and the platform used is collected. These data make it possible to improve a website's design and better tailor its contents to visitor customs and preferences. Google will store and use this information in line with the Google privacy policy. If you would like to opt out of Analytics cookies, you can do so by installing a respective plug-in to your browser.
The Site publishes Google Adsense advertisements, which are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine the latter, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's ads preference manager. You can also completely opt-out of receiving the Adsense partner network cookie. However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser, your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you might want to use a respective Google browser plug-in.
The Site contains plug-ins for the social network Facebook. You will recognise Facebook plug-ins by the Facebook logo on the Site. If you click the Facebook "Like" button while you are signed in to your Facebook account, you can link the content of the Site to your Facebook profile. This means that Facebook can allocate this interaction with the Site to your user account. The Site does not receive any notification about the content of the conveyed data or how it is used by Facebook. Further information about this topic can be found in the Facebook data privacy statement. If you do not want Facebook to be able to allocate your use of the Site to your Facebook user account, please do not click on the "Like" button or sign out of your Facebook account.
The Site uses the Plus One interface provided by the social network Google Plus , which is operated by Google. If you do not click on the button, no personal data will be captured.

Information about the purpose and extent of capturing this data and the further processing and use of the data by Google as well as your respective rights and options to protect your personal privacy can be found in Google’s data privacy notifications about the Plus One button, as well as in Google’s data privacy policies. If you are a Google Plus member and do not want Google to collect data about you via the Site, you should sign out of your Google Plus account.
Some functions offered by the online news and social networking service Twitter are integrated into this Site. Using Twitter and the function called "Tweet" enables websites that you have visited to be linked to your Twitter account and made available to other users. In the process, data is conveyed to Twitter that might be used for the purpose of conversion tracking and serving targeted ads. The Site does not obtain any knowledge about the content of the conveyed data or how it is used by Twitter. You can find more information about the treatment of personal information in the Twitter data privacy statement.
