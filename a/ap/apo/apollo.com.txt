A. The Types of Information We Collect
When you visit and browse the Sites, you may provide us with information, and we will collect certain information automatically.
1. Information You Provide to Us
In order to access certain services provided via the Sites or to request certain information from Apollo via the Sites, you will be required to provide certain personal information. More
This may include your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, facsimile number, investor status, or other information about yourself. In particular, you may be required to provide a username and password to access certain features. If you choose to not provide us with information, you might not be able to gain access to certain information and services on the Sites, which rely on such information (for example, you will not be able to register for e-mail updates if you do not provide us with an e-mail address, and if you choose not to provide a username and password, we will not be able to provide you with services available through an online account).
2. Information We Collect Automatically
We also collect information about you automatically. More
For example, when you visit the Sites, we collect your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, the pages you view on the Sites, the duration of your visit, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Sites, and the search terms you enter on the Sites.
We collect this information using cookies, which are small files that a website sends to your computer or device while you are viewing the website, or other technical methods to track visitor usage, including web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of a website.
We and other companies use cookies and web beacons for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to our Sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Sites so that the Sites will remember who you are. We use web beacons and other technologies to analyze the traffic patterns on the Sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Sites. More
You may be able to have your browser warn you when a cookie is sent, and you may be able to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your web browser settings. Each browser is different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie settings. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that may improve your browsing, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.
Other technical methods including web beacons may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send visitors to the Sites to determine whether such visitors have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.
3. Additional Information Collection Practices
The Sites may contain links to websites operated by third-parties, and your personal information may be collected by those third-parties when you use their websites. More
Should you choose to visit these third-party sites, you should review their privacy policies to ensure you understand and are comfortable with their practices concerning your information. We do not accept, and do disclaim, any responsibility for the privacy policies and information collection, use, and sharing practices of any third-party website (whether or not such site is linked on or to the Sites). These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only, and you access them at your own risk.
Some of our third-party partners may ask you to provide personal information on their websites and may share such personal information with us, as governed by their respective privacy policies. More
The third-party partners we receive personal information from include web hosting providers. We receive information related to name, occupation, address, and contact information from third party partners. Our use of information received from such a third party will be dictated by the third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.
We will link the information that we collect automatically with the information you provide us, and we will combine the information we collect online with information we collect offline or that is collected by third-parties.
