Aprimo Privacy Notice - Aprimo
Date last revised: October 29, 2018
Aprimo is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. This Privacy Notice explains what types of personally identifiable information we collect through our marketing and recruiting websites and software-as-a-service offerings (the “Sites”) to our customers and prospects and how we use that information.
Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It
Aprimo collects personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, or email address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is voluntarily submitted to us via the Sites. We use your information only as necessary to respond to your request for materials or as otherwise disclosed to you on the Sites where you submit your information. For example, if you request technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible. In addition, from time to time, we may refer to your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may use this information to contact you.
In addition, our customers may transmit your personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) to us through our software-as-a-service offerings. For example, some of our offerings allow our customers to generate and send marketing communications to end users. We utilize personally identifiable information transmitted to us only as instructed by our customers in order to deliver services to our customers or facilitate requests from our customers. We require our customers to transmit data to us only with your consent and in accordance with applicable laws. Nevertheless, if you believe that your personally identifiable information is misused through the Sites in any way, please contact us at the information below.
We provide links to third party sites strictly as a service to you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these third parties. However, Aprimo is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party Internet sites. If you leave the Sites to visit a third party site, the privacy notice of that third party site will apply to your visit.
We use standard server side logging to track the number of visitors to the Sites, gather HTTP header information, and generate statistics about visits to the Sites. For example, this information is used to generate analytics related to the Sites and for troubleshooting purposes.
Some pages within the Sites may use a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access an Internet website. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Sites or help us analyze site usage more accurately. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information except with your explicit permission. However, information gathered from the use of cookies may be combined with other data sources to identify you. To learn more about the utilization of cookies as it pertains to our marketing and developers sites please visit our Marketing and Developers Sites Cookie Policy.
The Sites are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. Aprimo does not collect personally identifiable data from any person it knows to be under the age of 13.
Do Not Track Signals
Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the Sites may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online. At this time, the Sites do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties
We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide via the Sites to any third party unless (1) otherwise disclosed to you when you submit your information; (2) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a business division of Aprimo, a line of Aprimo’s business or Aprimo’s entire business, or through merger with another company; (3) to provide necessary information to our agents, resellers, partners and contractors who may provide products and/or services to you; (4) as necessary for processing your transactions; or (5) for compliance with possible legal or governmental disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that one of our customers transmits or stores your personally identifiable information in the Sites, that customer may utilize your personally identifiable information in accordance with the consent you provided when that customer collected your information or otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
Protecting Personally Identifiable Information
Aprimo is committed to protecting the personally identifiable information entrusted to us. We have implemented physical, electronic and administrative procedures designed to safeguard personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, Aprimo cannot ensure or warrant that personally identifiable information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or from loss in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personally identifiable information (as defined by the applicable state and federal laws) stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.
GDPR and Privacy Shield
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a comprehensive data protection adopted by the EU commission to protect personally identifiable information of EU individuals. Aprimo takes the protection of personally identifiable information seriously and will comply with GDPR as applicable to the personally identifiable information that Aprimo collects.
