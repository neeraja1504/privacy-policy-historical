In your use of the website, you may have opportunity to send emails to recipients who are not APICS employees.

How to Access or Change Your Personal Information
To review or make changes to the content of your Personal Information, or to request that we limit the use of your Personal Information, you may make changes and updates by logging into your user profile and making such changes. Alternatively, you may request such changes by contacting ASCM Customer Relations using the contact information provided below.
In your request, clearly state what information you would like to have changed or updated. APICS will try to comply with your request as soon possible.
The deletion of Personal Information and other changes to the data retained by APICS as described above may result in the deletion or limitation of other services APICS provides, including, but not limited to, maintaining and making accessible APICS certification records.

Your Legal Rights. You have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Verification
APICS will regularly self-assess its compliance with all applicable laws and the Privacy Shield Principles regarding Personal Information that is received from the EU. APICS statement on verification and related self-assessment procedures is available to you upon request.
Recourse Mechanisms
APICS makes readily available independent recourse mechanisms by which your complaints and disputes are investigated and expeditiously resolved at no cost you.
