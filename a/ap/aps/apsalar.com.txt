Information We Collect Within our Mobile Services, for Publishers
Apsalar provides the Services to mobile application publishers. If you are a publisher using Apsalar’s Services, Apsalar may access, index, and cache requests made from your applications to our system, including by automated means.

Apsalar will automatically collect and receive information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, carrier provider, IP addresses, Apple’s ID for Advertising (IDFA), Google Android ID and Advertising ID for Android (AIFA), carrier user “ID”, and geo-location information. In this policy, we refer to this non-personally identifiable information, together with other non-personally identifiable information that we obtain from third parties, as “User Data.” Apsalar also supports the Do Not Track flags requested by Apple and Google. Apsalar purges User Data logs after 18 months.
