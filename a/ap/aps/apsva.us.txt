ARLINGTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Policy Implementation Procedures
30-2.3 Internet Privacy
Personal information collected and retained by the Arlington Public Schools website,
http://www.arlington.k12.va.us, will be maintained in compliance with the Virginia Privacy
Protection Act. APS reserves the right to amend its Internet privacy policy. The website may
contain links to or from other public or private entities’ websites, whose privacy practices APS
does not control. APS shall inform the public of any personal information collected through its
website by posting the following privacy statement or a link to this privacy statement in a
conspicuous manner on the website home page.
“The Arlington Public Schools (APS) collects only that personal information about citizens that
is necessary to provide the service or benefit desired. Only appropriate information will be
collected. This website
1. Does not place a “cookie ” on a user’s computer.
2. Will not track a user’s movements through the APS website.
3. Collects no personal information. Internet servers do collect communication protocol
addresses from the personal computers accessing the website in order to facilitate
communication. By itself, this information does not constitute personal information. The
Internet domain and Internet address of the computer a citizen is using is automatically
collected when that citizen accesses the APS website. In addition, the identification of the
page or service a citizen is requesting, the type of browser and operating system the citizen is
using, the date and time of access, and the Internet address of the website from which the
citizen linked directly to the APS website is automatically collected. The domain and
address are used to route the requested web page to the citizen’s computer for viewing. They
are sent to the APS Internet service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the
requested page to the citizen. APS does not control the privacy practices of those entities.
The other information collected automatically is used to assist APS in responding to citizen
requests and in planning website improvements.
4. On rare occasions, when a “hacker” attempts to breach computer security, logs of Internet
domains and addresses are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may
be forwarded together with any other relevant information in APS’ possession to law
enforcement agencies. APS uses this information primarily in a statistical summary-type
format to assess its website content and server performance.
If you have questions about this privacy statement or the practices of this website or if you
choose to review or correct any information you previously submitted, please contact APS at
703-228-6005.”
A “cookie” is an electronic identification tag placed on a user’s hard drive so that outside companies can identify a user’s
computer easily.
