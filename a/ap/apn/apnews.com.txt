Privacy Policy
The Associated Press ("AP") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information that may be collected by us regarding users or readers of AP news content online. Accordingly, we have adopted a privacy policy to govern how we treat such information in connection with our AP Hosted Service, which is a participant in the News Licensing Group Service.
This policy applies to AP's Digital News Experience product, and is a supplement to and incorporates the News Licensing Group Privacy Policy. This privacy policy does not apply to information you may provide to us offline. AP may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, and any such changes will become effective when the AP posts the revised privacy policy online. Your continued use of this web site indicates your consent to AP's privacy policy and the most current version then in effect.
What information do we collect?
The AP Digital News Experience displays news stories and includes advertising delivered by third parties. An AP-hosted page also collects users' information in connection with the News Licensing Group Service. The types of information AP collects from visits to those pages, and how AP and the News Licensing Group partners use and disclose that information, is described in the News Licensing Group Privacy Policy.
The News Licensing Group (NLG) is a means for AP and other participants in the NLG to determine where and when their content is accessed and to police unapproved dissemination of such content. You may read about NLG data collection policies and your privacy, and opt-out of NLG data collection here.

("24/7"), Chartbeat (“Chartbeat”), comScore ("Comscore"), and Google Analytics (“Google”) to collect non-personally identifiable information on pages that contain AP's news content.
