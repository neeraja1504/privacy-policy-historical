We use this information only for internal review and analytics in aggregated and anonymized (not personally identifiable) form. Our server will not automatically record your name or e-mail address. Your e-mail address and other personally identifiable information (“PII”) will not be known to APM unless you voluntarily submit it to us.

However, if you refuse to accept them, some features of the Site may not function properly, and you will have to keep reentering the same information to navigate the Site.
