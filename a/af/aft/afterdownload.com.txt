2.       Which information we may collect on our Users?
We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:
The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“Non-personal
Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-

while Users are using the Site. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical
information and behavioral information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on
the Site, type of operation system, User's 'click-stream' on the Site, browser and keyboard language, device
manufacturer, device model etc.
The second type of information is individually identifiable information (“Personal Information”). This
information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.
a. Users of the Site automatically provide their IP address and as applicable, GAID/IDFA.
b. In addition, Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details
provided consciously and voluntarily by the User. The Personal Information is collected
from the details the Users provide in the sign-up on on the Site which requires e-mail
address, name, password, publisher name, country and web site URL. The User can
optionally fill in his/her daily impressions, and top trafficked country.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information
shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which
is obtained, inter alia, through your acceptance to the this Privacy Policy.

the Site we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to
such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed

Personal information which you voluntarily provide when you fill in the sign-up in order
to sign you up for the Services. We store the Personal Information either independently or
through the help of our authorized third-party service providers as detailed below.
What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?
