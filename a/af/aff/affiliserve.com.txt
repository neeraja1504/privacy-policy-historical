Cookies
Advertisements served by OMG Network and displayed at affiliate sites may use cookies stored on users’ computers to record information on clicks, leads and sales – in other words, information on:

OMG cookies do not include any personally identifiable information and are used purely to track the performance of OMG affiliates, as well as to improve the relevancy (‘targeting’) of served advertisements, for example by making them more closely related to the type of website or web page that a particular user has visited.

Under the terms of their contracts with OMG, all OMG affiliates are obliged to inform their users of the fact that OMG advertisements hosted on their sites may store cookies to users’ computers, in addition to their statutory privacy and data protection responsibilities.
OMG has no control over any additional cookies that may be used by its affiliates or clients.
