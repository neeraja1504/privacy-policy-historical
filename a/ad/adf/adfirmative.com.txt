Adfirmative’ Privacy Policy applies only to Web sites and services that are owned and operated by Adfirmative, LLC. While other Web sites may be displayed as search results or links from within Adfirmative, those sites are owned and operated by others, and they may have different privacy policies.

It’s also important to note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you post, yourself, in public areas of the Adfirmative Web site. For example, if you choose to let other people see your list of goals, your name, and your answers to the other profile questions, or if you post information or comments on a discussion board, that information will be made public.

We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services, we may also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you register with Adfirmative and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. You are free to use Adfirmative without registering or setting up a personal Adfirmative Account; however, some of our services and web pages are available only to those who are registered users. We collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Adfirmative cookie information, and the pages you request. We use your personal information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. In short, the information you provide us can help us to understand how to make the Web Site more convenient and useful to you. In general, we provide access to your personal information only to Adfirmative employees and contractors who we believe need that access in order to do their jobs and to provide products or services to you.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Your User Profile information including member's age, and town, are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Adfirmative social networking community. We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you request, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Adfirmative under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Adfirmative communicate with you about offers from Adfirmative and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal information with third parties such as the media, advertisers, and government agencies. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics, such as numbers of Adfirmative users who live in a particular state or fall within a particular age group. Such aggregate information is gathered from individual Adfirmative users’ information but is not traceable to any specific identifiable Adfirmative user. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Adfirmative terms of use, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. If Adfirmative is acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Our Advertisers
We do not share your personal information with our advertisers. However, the advertising we display is targeted to users of particular services and content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may assume that you meet the targeting criteria – for example, but not limited to, women ages 50-60 from a particular geographic area or with children or grandchildren of a certain age.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Adfirmative, like many Web sites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL, or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Adfirmative, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Adfirmative to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your zip code) and products or services that reflect your interests. In addition to Adfirmative’ cookies, when you visit www.leadsandfeeds.com your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers, and from other sites displayed as search results or links. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Adfirmative’ Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those advertisers and outside Web sites.
You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of www.leadsandfeeds.com interactive features, and we hope you will leave them turned on.
Adfirmative also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access Adfirmative cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Adfirmative products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Adfirmative Web site. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Adfirmative users, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.
Third-party Ad Serving
Adfirmative contracts with third party companies to help us make sure that our content and advertising are relevant and effective, and to analyze how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes, for example, the pages you visited at www.leadsandfeeds.com. This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which products are most interesting, and what kinds of offers our visitors like to see. Although our third party marketing partners manage the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of allowing us to analyze such data by clicking here. The ads on Adfirmative pages are delivered to you by “Double Clicking”, our web advertising partner.
