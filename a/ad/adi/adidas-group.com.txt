Data collected by automated means helps us to evaluate how specific sections of our websites are used and to classify visitors (country of residence, how did the visitor end up on our website, etc.). This allows us to improve our websites and our mobile applications and ensure that they address the widest possible audience.
6. Disclosure of information
One of our core principles states that your data shall be treated with confidentiality. We will not sell your data to third parties. If required by law your data will be disclosed to third parties. If required due to business requirements and provided that it is allowed under the applicable law, we will transfer your data to other companies of the adidas Group. In all other cases data will not be transferred without obtaining your prior consent.
We sometimes make use of service providers and of data processors working on behalf of adidas. These services can include hosting and maintenance services, analysis services, e-mail messaging services etc. These third parties are granted access to such personal data they require in order to be able to carry out the particular service. The service providers and data processors are contractually obliged to treat such information in the strictest confidence. It is also contractually forbidden for them to use the data in any other way than that required.
There may be occasions on which we disclose data to our partners in an anonymised form. Such anonymised data includes, for example, information about the number of visitors to a website or a mobile application during a certain period of time. Such information is generally only disclosed in a ‘bundled’ form.
7. Your rights
If you provide us with personal data via our websites or other channels, this is done on an entirely voluntary basis and with the granting of your consent for it to be used in accordance with the provisions of this online privacy policy. In certain cases, only those people that have submitted the necessary personal data to us are able to use certain services and in other ways avail themselves of the activities and offers available on our websites. As transparency and fair play are particularly important issues for us, we provide various options in order to help you retain control over your data. These options may include the possibility of displaying and editing your data online. It may also be possible to unsubscribe from services or delete user accounts or to receive information about the data held.
7.1 Right to object
With regard to e-mails that contain, for example, a newsletter or marketing content, you have the option to terminate the receiving of such e-mails (unsubscribe) by following the relevant instructions in the respective e-mail.  With regard to other types of message you may receive, such as maintenance announcements or administrational notifications, the receiving of these can only be terminated by deleting your account, as such messages are a mandatory part of user accounts and the related use of our websites or our mobile applications.
7.2 Right to request information
You have the right to be informed at any time about the personal data stored about you, its origin and recipients as well as the purpose for which it is being stored.

8. Security of the information and data integrity
We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised use, disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing and misuse.
9. Protection of children’s personal data
The protection of children’s personal data is extremely important. adidas feels that it has a responsibility to protect the privacy of children and has no intention of collecting the data of children under the age of 14. We also encourage parents and other guardians to surf the Internet together with their children and participate with their children in the multitude of activities offered by the wide range of websites on the World Wide Web (WWW).
If a child attempts to register himself or herself, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described in the above section entitled “2.What personal data is collected”. In addition, the data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be used as described above.
If a child under the age of 14 attempts to submit a registration application, this will be rejected with the notification that applications from children under the age of 14 are not accepted. For that reason, we ask parents and other guardians to check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.
10. Social Networks
Our Websites and/or mobile applications provide you Social Plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network, your activity on our website or adidas mobile application will also be made available to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
If you are logged on in one of the social networks during the visit on one of our Websites or mobile applications the social network might add this information to your profile. If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off in your social network before you enter one of our Websites or mobile applications.
We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer via the Social Plug-ins. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.
