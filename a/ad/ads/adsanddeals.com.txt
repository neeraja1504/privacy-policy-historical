COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name address and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or other information which we may request from time to time) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us.
This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. Please do not post any personal information on the Site that you expect to keep private.
We do not store credit card information. Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and we endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at the Site. We use this data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Site, showing the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the user's preferences.
We may use customer information for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction completion purposes.
OTHER DATA WE COLLECT
All classified and forum postings are stored in our database, even after "deletion," and may be archived elsewhere.
