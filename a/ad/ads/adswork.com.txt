We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

This information is never tied to any personal identifying information about you during the search except for your first name, initial of last name, photographs and your general location (State + Country.) When an agency contacts you through our scouting system you can accept or decline to respond.

ADVERTISERS ON Adswork.com All users accessing the Adswork.com Web site, and viewing advertisements on Adswork.com�s Web pages, retain complete anonymity where Adswork.com is concerned. As ads are delivered Adswork.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. Adswork.com does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Adswork.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of Adswork.com advertising clients and customers.
The Cookie Principle
Adswork.com may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first access a Adswork.com Web page with or without an ad on it, Adswork.com or its advertising client may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to measure the popularity of the different sections of the site, and to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute or which articles on the site are more popular. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over and can also help us improve the Adswork.com Web site content and features based on user�s actual usage of the site - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. If you refuse a cookie, you can still use Adswork.com but your experience may differ from those individuals using cookies.
3rd Party Measurement Services Often, advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service other than Adswork.com for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, Adswork.com has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact us at support@adswork.com
Disclosure
Adswork.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to us at support@adswork.com
Adswork.com reserves the right to amend this Privacy Statement at any time without notice, and only the current Privacy Statement may be deemed effective. Regardless of later updates or changes to our privacy notice, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. This Privacy notice was last updated on April 7, 2008 and is deemed effective as of this date.
