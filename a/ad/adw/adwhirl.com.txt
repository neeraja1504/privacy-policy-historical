AdMob Mobile Services
AdMob provides mobile advertising services ("Mobile Services") to advertisers and publishers. If you are a publisher using AdMob's Mobile Services, AdMob may access, index, and cache requests made from your mobile sites, applications and device platforms to our system, including by automated means. In the course of providing these Mobile Services, AdMob collects aggregate data from publishers' sites and uses such data for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to, providing publishers, advertisers and others with aggregate information about traffic and site usage in our advertising network.
AdMob also collects certain information about visitors to publishers' sites that connect to the AdMob Mobile Services. AdMob will automatically collect and receive information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device type, carrier provider, IP addresses, unique device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited and clicks on advertisements we display. AdMob may track that information over time and over multiple publishers' sites and use non-personally identifiable information collected from such visitors to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to your visitors. In some cases, the mobile phone service providers for mobile devices may send visitors' phone numbers to AdMob. AdMob uses such information to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and technologies and may also use this data to display advertising customized to visitors' interests and preferences. AdMob does not use such information for telemarketing, to contact any individuals or to share with any third parties for their own use. In addition, AdMob may collect personal information directly from customers on behalf of advertisers and periodically transfer such information to such advertisers.

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above.
