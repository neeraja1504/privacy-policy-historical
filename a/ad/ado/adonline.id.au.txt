Purpose of Policy
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information may be gathered about you when you visit this site, how that information may be used, whether it’s disclosed it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding the use of, and your ability to correct this information. The policy allows you to choose what kind and how much information you provide to Adam Dimech and Adam Dimech Online and to control how any information you provide is used.

Collection of Information
Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use Adam Dimech Online. Depending on the service you are accessing, you may be asked to provide information such as your name, email address or other information. It is entirely your choice whether you respond to these questions or not.
Adam Dimech Online collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, the Adam Dimech Online server (adonline.id.au or photologium.com) collects data which indicates your computer’s country of origin (eg: .au for Australia), your IP address (your computer’s identity), the type of browser you are using, the duration of your visit and the pages you download. None of this can be related to you personally, and you remain totally anonymous.
The second type of information that Adam Dimech Online collects is personal information. Adam Dimech Online will collect personal information that makes known the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address, when you willingly provide it. With this information, Adam Dimech Online can provide a variety of enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users.
On rare occasions, Adam Dimech Online may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service. Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, residential address and/or type of computer in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of additional services which may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information when you are undertaking product or service registration on the Adam Dimech Online website. How much of your personal information that you choose to disclose to Adam Dimech Online is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it.
Use of Anonymous Information

This collective data helps Adam Dimech determine how many visitors use parts of the site, so improvements can be made to Adam Dimech Online to assure that it is as appealing as possible for as many users as possible. Adam Dimech will never publish this information. It is solely used by the site administrator to monitor the site's popularity.
