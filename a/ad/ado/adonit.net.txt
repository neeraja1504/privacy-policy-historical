Adonit Creative Inc. (“Adonit,” “our,” “us,” or "we") respects your privacy. We created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect and how we use it, as well as our information sharing and protection practices.
This Privacy Policy applies to:

The Forge mobile application (the “App” );
Information collected by Adonit from third party applications ( “Non-Adonit Apps” ) that integrate our Adonit software development kit ( “SDK” ); and
Any email, text and other electronic communications you send to Adonit through the Website or the App.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to:
Information we collect offline or by any other means (such as through other websites, products or services we may offer);
Information collected by any third parties, including through Non-Adonit Apps, which may have their own privacy policies.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should not access the Website or download the App or Non-Adonit Apps that interface with our SDK. By using the Website, the App or Non-Adonit Apps, you consent to the practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

Adonit does not consider this information to be Personal Information, but note that the IP address and stylus serial number may potentially be used in a personally identifying manner.
Information You Voluntarily Disclose
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Information through any public-facing features of the Website, the App or Non-Adonit Apps that interface with our SDK (for example, via message boards), that information can be collected and used by others. You submit this information at your own risk. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information you choose to submit in connection with these public features.
