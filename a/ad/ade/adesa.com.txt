If we learn that anyone under the age of 13 has provided any personal information through the Service, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly delete it.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to other companies’ websites or services or links that you may access via the Service, except that this Privacy Policy does apply to our use of information you provide through, and information regarding, your interactions with our profiles, pages, advertisements and other presences on social networking platforms and our social networking platform integrations. Information collected or received by these third parties is subject to third party privacy policies. If you are located outside the United States, please note that personal information collected via the Service may be transferred to the United States and other countries which might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your own country.

Device Settings. We may request and collect mobile location information (if you have activated a mobile application with us and permitted your mobile device to transmit location data), and financial account information. Company mobile applications may also request certain permissions for certain device functions (such as permission to access your device’s camera to record audio, to read your device’s contact list, etc.) and collect information regarding certain device settings (e.g., the permissions you have set on your device, such as CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO, READ_PHONE_STATE, GET_ACCOUNTS and READ_CONTACTS, for example), which Company may also use and disclose for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. The information we collect is used to improve the content and quality of the Service.
Cookie Technology. Company employs “cookie” technology to help visitors move faster through the Service. When you sign on to Company’s website(s), Company passes a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a website and stored on the hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory. This leads to quicker navigation and a generally more positive experience searching for the information you desire. By using our website(s), you consent to our use of cookies as described above. We may, from time to time, use similar technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, flash objects, location tracking and/or third party widgets for purposes of enhancing your web or mobile experience and/or for purposes of allowing you to share information on another platform, such as a social media platform.
Aggregate Data and Tracking. From time to time, we may analyze browsing information and aggregate data for quality assurance, contextual advertising and other similar activities.

Information about your online activities on this and other websites (e.g., pages viewed), may be used by Company and third parties such as advertising networks to select an advertisement to display on the Service or other websites for a product, service, or offer that matches your interests. In other words, we may engage in online behavioral or interest-based advertising. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection and use of information by third parties for online behavioral advertising purposes by going to these sites to opt-out : Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) or Digital Advertising Alliance (http://youradchoices.ca/choices). Opting out means you will still receive online advertising but the advertising will not be tailored by the listed third-parties based on your online behavior or usage. In addition, we do not currently respond to “Do Not Track (DNT)” browser signals.

Company may share personal and/or aggregated information that you have provided with other business divisions within the KAR Auction Services, Inc. group of companies. Company shares credit information concerning dealer with its sister companies. Company uses analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as DoubleClick Cookies and AdWords, to collect non-personal information in the form of usage/user metrics with your access to the Service. These tools collect and analyze various types of information, including, for example, Analytics. Company may share information with agents and contractors in order to help operate the Service.
Company may share information as necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law, regulation or governmental request. We may share and/or transfer information in the event of a potential or actual acquisition of Company or its merger with another company.
Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention. Personal information may not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required by law or regulation. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as required by law or regulation. We may permit certain third party companies to help us deliver customized advertising that we feel would be of interest to you based on your use of the Service. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of delivering targeted ads, you may opt-out. You have to opt-out using each of your web browsing applications and devices separately.

You can also control your individual advertising settings, Google offers additional information about its Remarketing Privacy Guidelines and Restrictions. See https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2549063. Please note that this action does not opt you out from all advertising – you will still see ads on the Internet, and we may still suggest offerings to you on our Service based on your history at our Service.
Social Networking. Company uses several social networking and blogging platforms to communicate with our customers, some of which are operated by third parties, such as Facebook and Twitter. This Privacy Policy applies to our use of information you submit to us there, but it does not apply to what those third party platforms do with your information. Those platforms have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to read them. The Service may include features and functionalities that allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third party social networking platform. If you do so, then personal information or other data that you have provided to that third party will be made available to us, pursuant to the third party’s terms and conditions, and you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The information we receive from that third party may depend on the privacy settings you have on the third party site. We may also include tools on the Service that allow you to share and/or publicly post content or information from the Service to your profile on a third party social network.
“Linked-To” Websites. The Service may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements that lead to other websites. We are not responsible for these other sites, and so their posted privacy policies (not this Privacy Policy) will govern the collection and use of your information on them. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each website visited after leaving the Service to learn about how your information is treated by others.
Opt-In and Opt-Out. You may have the right to opt in or opt out of certain of our uses and disclosures of your information.
