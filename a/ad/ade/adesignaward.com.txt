A' Design Award and Competition - Privacy Policy
****Your privacy is critically important to us. At A' Design Award and Competition we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
In our profile pages and portfolio creation products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
OMC Design Studios SRL owner of A' Design Award and Competitions (“ A' Design Award and Competition ”) operates several websites including adesignaward.com, adesigncompetition.com,  adesignawards.com, and adesigncompetitions.com. It is A' Design Award and Competition’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, A' Design Award and Competition collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. A' Design Award and Competition’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how A' Design Award and Competition’s visitors use its website. From time to time, A' Design Award and Competition may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
A' Design Award and Competition also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. A' Design Award and Competition does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to A' Design Award and Competition’s websites choose to interact with A' Design Award and Competition in ways that require A' Design Award and Competition to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that A' Design Award and Competition gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register at adesignaward.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with A' Design Award and Competition – by purchasing design competition joining and controlling service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, A' Design Award and Competition collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with A' Design Award and Competition. A' Design Award and Competition does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

If you are a registered user of an A' Design Award and Competition website and have supplied your email address, A' Design Award and Competition may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with A' Design Award and Competition and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. A' Design Award and Competition takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
