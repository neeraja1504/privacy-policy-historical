ADEA Privacy Policy
ADEA Privacy Policy
Last updated: June 2018
The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) respects your privacy and we have developed the following policy to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy policy applies to all personal information we collect, including personal information collected via the ADEA website located at www.adea.org (the Site), ADEA programs and services, other websites that link to this policy (also referred to as the Site), web-based applications and surveys. Please note that some other ADEA websites may have unique privacy policies in which case they will link to a different ADEA privacy policy. The purpose of the privacy policy is to describe 1) the types of information collected, 2) how that information is used, and 3) the choices users have about the collection and use of this information.
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an email at privacy@adea.org or write us at ADEA, Attn: Web Services, 655 K Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20001.
