Adgorithms | Privacy Policy
Adgorithms (“Adgorithms”, “we” or “us”) understands how important it is to keep your private information safely as you interact with our network. This Privacy policy was created to inform you what information we collect when you visit Adgorithms.com (the “Site”) as well as our customers and partners website (“Partners”), and when you use Adgorithms’ solutions to optimize and manage your campaigns (the “Solutions”, and together with the Site- the “Service”).

For example, when you use the Site your mobile device tells us your browser type.

ADGORITHMS USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Adgorithms technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements on our network. This form of advertising is called Re-targeting, and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing the users advertisements that are of interest to them. When a user visits one of our advertiser’s websites, an Adgorithms pixel on that site sets an Adgorithms cookie on the computer of the user. When that user visits one of our partner’s websites, they will identify the cookie and recognize that they previously visited our advertiser’s website. The user will then be shown an advertisement from that advertiser. In this instance, Adgorithms will know the user first visited our advertiser’s website, and then our partner’s website. We will know the user viewed the ad on our partner’s website, and whether or not the user clicked on that ad. This type information is what we use in reporting, and in no way can be used to identify who that user is, or any other online activities of the user outside of Adgorithms network. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to any personal information. You are able to Opt-Out of Adgorithms’s services if you do not want to be a part of future reporting or take part in Re-targeting services from Adgorithms – please see below for instructions on how to Opt-Out.

If you wish to Opt-Out of our services, you may do so at any time. Keep in mind that by Opting-Out, you will not enjoy our Re-targeting services. You are free to delete all cookies on your browser, or to have your browser notify you when a cookie is set: simply check your browser settings to do so. By deleting your cookies in this manner, you will disable us, our advertisers and our partners from delivering ads that are targeted to your interests. You will have to clear your cookies each time you visit Adgorithms.com or one of our advertiser’s websites to ensure you are not receiving Re-targeted advertisements. Another way to Opt-Out is to click this link. When you Opt-Out of Adgorithm’s services in this manner, a cookie will be set on your browser. Adgorithms must maintain the cookie on your browser in order to recognize you as an Opted-Out visitor. You must Opt-Out again if you clear that cookie from your browser, use a different Internet browser, or use a new computer to access the Internet.
SECURITY
Adgorithms has established safeguards to help prevent our information from being subjected to unauthorized access or misuse. However, we cannot guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of Adgorithms and its affiliated providers).
