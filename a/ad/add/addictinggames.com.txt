Developer Center
Jump to: Submit an Online Game
Welcome to the Addicting Games Developer Community. As a member of the community, we ask that you cut your grass, refrain from burning things on Sundays and occasionally send us a game to feature. Addicting Games is the largest casual games site on any of the MANY Internets. At Addicting Games we work with a broad range of developers from across the world. How many developers, you ask? How does 1 million sound? Too high? Yeah, you're probably right. Realistically, it's in the thousands. But that's still a lot!
At Addicting Games, we enjoy building relationships with independent and professional game developers and have many ways to showcase, distribute and promote your game titles.
Developer Sponsorship
We want to get the best oringal games in front of as many players as possible, on as many platforms as possible.
If you want to get a game sponsored by Addicting Games, ask yourself if it meets the following criteria:
Is it original?
Does your game feature some new game mechanic or twist on gameplay? If not, are you at least doing it better than similar games? We look for creativity and most of all fun! Fun doesn't need to be polished and perfect, fun can be a half-done work in progress that has everyone playing for hours.
Is it a good fit for AddictingGames.com?
There are a lot of great games that simply aren't right for our audience. Check out some of our games to get a feel for our brand. We want games that can be enjoyed by everyone, many of our players are playing from work and schools so we try not to get people fired / suspended for having little downtime playing games.
Is it mobile-ready?
Can you easily convert the game for mobile platforms? If not, it's not a deal-breaker. But if you can, well that's like asking whether we want a tasty doughnut or a tasty doughnut with a jetpack attached to it.
Is it addictive errrr ADDICTING?
Does it have that je ne sais quoi? If not, does it speak French and could it tell us what je ne sais quoi means? On the level (pun!), some of the most addicting, replayable games are the simplest. We can't pick up every game we like or every game that's kind of fun. Does your game stand out above the rest?
Please read the following instructions carefully and if you have any questions please feel free to contact us.
Important requirements for HTML5 games.
The game must be responsive to resizing and can display in landscape or portrait modes. We want your game to appear properly on all modern web browsers and mobile devices.
Please make sure your game does not link out to any sites other than your own. If your game does link out, please declare it to us so we can evaluate as we may ask that you remove them. Advertisements also fall under this request.
Make sure your games can be played on mobile devices, your control scheme should take mobile players into account.
Please remove all 3rd party tracking from your games. We don't like tracking and spyware and other junk, our players don't like it either.
Preloader Visuals
If your game happens to be a single-player title, please be sure to incorporate the Addicting Games Preloader to display when your game launches. You can find the files you need to implement below.
HTML5 Preloader

Please read the following policy ("policy") to understand how certain of your information collected on the Addictng Games Sites will be collected, used, shared and retained.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES Addicting Games COLLECT?

(See the "Behavioral advertising" section below for more information on certain third parties who may also collect similar information when you visit the Addicting Games Sites for online behavioral advertising purposes.) This includes which pages are visited, which advertisements are viewed, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. For purposes of clarity, unless visitors submit personal information directly to us (e.g.: by means of a site registration, in connection with a contest, etc.), our sites do not collect visitorâs personal information. Additional information on how we treat personal information that is submitted directly to us and how such information may be shared may be found in our privacy policy.

BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING
|
We analyze non-personal information that we collect on the Addicting Games Sites, or obtain from third parties, and organize it into anonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions. We and our clients and partners then use these anonymous user profiles, groups and audiences to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. We and our clients also use this data for other related purposes (for example, to do research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of our visitors.) The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date or social security number. Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of data for purposes of behavioral advertising to anonymous, non-personal information.
When you visit any of the Addicting Games Sites and view ads from Addicting Games' advertisers, Addicting Games automatically receives and stores certain types of non-personal information including IP address, web pages viewed, date and time, and responses to advertisements delivered. While each advertising technology uses different types of technology to collect this information, including log files, cookies and pixels, none of the foregoing by itself or together can be tracked to a specific individualâs personal information, and the non-personal information collected by Addicting Games will not be shared with third parties, except as expressly indicated in this policy. The non-personal information collected through your use of the Addicting Games Sites is used to provide relevant, targeted advertising and improve Addicting Gadvertising technology; monitor website traffic; collect statistical data; determine the effectiveness of advertisements and content; and collect data across multiple websites to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in online behavioral advertising. Addicting Games may track visits to the Addicting Games Sites and this information may be used over time to help predict your consumer interest segments and select the ad content you see. Addicting Games may also use non-personally identifiable profile-based anonymous information with other non-personal information..
TRANSPARENCY IN ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING
|
Addicting Games does not create or use potentially sensitive data segments to provide its targeted online behavioral advertising for advertisers, including, but not limited to, health related audience segments. Addicting Games is a member of the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct, which may be found here, and the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which may be found here.
OPT-OUT
|
You may choose to not participate in our personalized advertising services by "opting out" of such personalized advertising services through the Network Advertising Initiativeâs Consumer Opt-out Program. Opting out will not remove advertisements. You will continue to see advertisements provided by Addicting Games, but the advertising will not be customized or targeted based on information collected by Addicting Games.

DATA RETENTION

We and our partners may retain the anonymous user data we or our partners collect on the Addicting Games Sites for up to nine (9) months from the date of its collection, after which time it is deleted from, or deactivated on, our and our partnersâ active databases. In addition, we maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete or deactivate the information from its active database. We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.
WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
|
Except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this policy or in our privacy policy, Addicting Games does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with third parties unless users consent to such sharing practices. We may from time to time share user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.
WHAT ARE "COOKIES" AND "WEB BEACONS" AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?
|
The Addicting Games Sites may use "cookies" and "web beacons" to speed navigation, keep track of items viewed, clicked on and/or shared, including links and advertisements, and provide you with custom-tailored services. A "web beacon" is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use "cookies" to remember information you gave us so you donât have to re-enter it each time you visit the Addicting Games Sites. By showing us how and when visitors use the Addicting Games Sites, "cookies" and "web beacons" allow us to see which Addicting Games Site areas and content are popular, and help us target content and advertisements based on user behavior. In addition, "cookies" will allow us to display in your profile which Addicting Gamesand affiliated websites you have visited, unless you opt out of that feature in your account. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own "cookies." We do not control these "cookies." You should check the privacy policy of these advertisers or websites to see whether and how they use "cookies."
Most browsers are initially set to accept "cookies." If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "cookies." You will not be able to fully use the Addicting Games Sites if you turn off the "cookies" option.

Addicting Games User Submission Agreement
Please read this User Submission Agreement carefully because it is a part of the  Terms of Use Agreement and represents your legally binding agreement with us ("Agreement") regarding your submission (and our display and distribution) of content to the Site via certain technology, functionality and/or features we make available to you so you can upload and post such content for display via the Site (collectively, the "User Material Submission Features"). Unless defined separately, terms used in this Agreement are defined in our Terms of Use Agreement.
When you submit User Material (as defined below in Section 1), or by using or attempting to use the User Material Submission Features, you are signifying your agreement with and acceptance of all terms and conditions of this Agreement as well as the terms and conditions contained in the Terms of Use Agreement that govern your legal and contractual relationship with Addicting Games, Inc.
We have the right to change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time as described in our Terms of Use Agreement. If you do not agree with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, including, without limitation, those times when we make changes, do not use, do not attempt to use, and immediately discontinue your use of, the User Material Submission Features, because if you do any of these things you are agreeing to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any changes we have made.
IMPORTANT NOTE: You must meet the Age Requirements in Section 2 of this Agreement and each and every time you submit or attempt to submit User Material, among other things, you will be asked to confirm your compliance.
1. Submitting User Material.
The term "User Material" means and refers to any and all content, media and materials you submit for posting or create by using Applications on the Site using any of the User Material Submission Features, including, without limitation, still photographs, writings, messages, user feedback, data, comments, suggestions, information, text, data, software, images, files, spoken statements, music, audio, video, video recordings, audio-visual works and recordings, slides, portraits, animated and/or motion pictures, caricatures, likenesses, vocal or other sounds, sound recordings, voices, voice reproductions, computer graphics and visual effects, as well as any accompanying documentation, packaging or other materials, tangible or intangible, and to all derivative works, translations, adaptations or variations of same, regardless of the tangible medium, broadcast medium, format or form, now known or hereinafter developed or discovered, and regardless of where produced, on location, in a studio or elsewhere, in black-and-white or in color, alone or in conjunction with other work, characters, real or imaginary, in any part of the world. User Material is also considered a "Posting", as such term defined in the Terms of Use Agreement, and therefore, all terms and conditions contained within the section of the Terms of Use Agreement "Postings" shall apply to all User Material you submit or create on the Site pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for Posting to the Site. Each time you create, upload or submit User Material (or if you attempt to do so) you will be confirming your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Instructions for uploading User Material can be found on the web page for the upload of User Material. To be considered for posting and display to the public, User Material must meet all the specifications and requirements relating to formatting, compatibility, operating characteristics and submission which can also be found on the Site's web page for the upload of User Material. In order to submit User Material, you will also need to meet our Age Requirements (see Section 2 below). When you submit User Material you may also be asked to provide some information about you and your submission. This may include, without limitation, such things as a descriptive title, some information about the User Material, length, your location and/or similar information. By submitting User Material, you are also agreeing and you understand that the term "User Material" also includes, without limitation, and refers to all of the information you submit or we may receive that is related to your submission. Always keep a copy of anything you send because we are not responsible for lost, damaged, misdirected, unusable or unreadable User Material. Proof that you submitted User Material does not constitute proof that we received anything.
2. Age Requirements.
By submitting User Material pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement you are certifying that you satisfy the age eligibility and requirements set forth in the Terms of Use Agreement.
3. User Material Standards; Unauthorized Content.
You are solely responsible and liable for your communications and submissions (and the consequences) made under your name, user name, email address, password and your registration and profile information, if any. User Material does not reflect the views of Addictinggames or Addicting Games, and neither Addicting Games, nor any of the Affiliates, represents or guarantees the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any User Material, or endorses or supports any opinions expressed in any User Material. In no event shall Addicting Games or the Affiliates have or be construed to have any responsibility or liability for or in connection with any User Material. If we determine, in our sole discretion, you have not met the Age Requirements (see Section 2 above) or if, in our judgment, you or any User Material you submit violates this Agreement, we reserve the right, at any time, without notice and without limiting any and all other rights we may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to (a) refuse to allow you to submit further User Material, (b) remove and delete your User Material, (c) revoke your registration and right to use the User Material Submission Features and (d) use any technological, legal, operational or other means available to enforce the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, blocking specific IP addresses or deactivating your registration, access using your e-mail address, your user name and password.
We make no claim the User Material Submission Features or any User Material are appropriate for any particular purpose or audience, or that any video, software or our User Material Submission Features may be accessed, used or downloaded outside of the United States, which may not be legal for certain persons or in certain countries and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The United States controls the export of products and information and you agree to comply with such restrictions and not to export or re-export any User Material including videos, information, software, materials, products or services to countries or persons prohibited under the export control laws and regulations.
You agree you will not submit or attempt to submit, and we have the right to reject, refuse to accept, remove or otherwise handle as Addicting Games deems appropriate, any "Unauthorized Content" which is defined as any User Material that is or could be construed as violating any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and/or any of the terms and conditions set forth in our  Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation:
infringing on a third party's copyright or other intellectual property rights;
causing harm, harassing anyone or which may prevent, prohibit, inhibit, restrict or otherwise impair others from using or enjoying the Site;
unauthorized access to the User Material Submission Features or information of other users;
the modification, impairment, disruption, alteration or interference with the use, features, functions, operation or maintenance of the User Material Submission Features; or
any requirements, rules, terms or conditions that may be applicable to the User Material Submission Features.
Neither Addicting Games nor or the Affiliates control any User Material submitted, although we may use both automated and manual means of reviewing User Material in order to prevent Unauthorized Content from appearing and being displayed on our Site. Addicting Games reserves the right to review any submitted User Material and to delete, remove, move, edit or reject, without notice to you, any User Material that we deem, in our sole discretion, abusive, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, in violation of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights, to be in violation of this Agreement or to be unacceptable to Addicting Games or or Affiliates, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever; provided, however, that Addicting Games shall have no obligation or liability to you for failure to do so or for doing so in any particular manner. If Addicting Games receives notice of any claim of infringement that satisfies specific legal requirements, such as notice and takedown requirements under U.S. copyright law (see Section 4 below), we may remove User Material associated with such claim. Addicting Games reserves the right to provide information to law enforcement officials, governmental agencies and pursuant to judicial or regulatory compulsion, to protect their respective interests, the Site or to comply with legal, regulatory, audit and compliance obligations.
4. Copyright Infringement.
If you believe any User Material violates the copyright of any other party, you can notify us by complying with the procedures set forth in our Copyright Compliance Policy.

Consider the user's unique personality and level of maturity. Every young person is different, and adults should use their judgment in deciding which games are appropriate for young people in their care.

Try playing the games yourself! You'll have fun and be able to provide better guidance for your young person.
If you cannot supervise a user's play on the site, and are not comfortable with the young person visiting AddictingGames on his or her own, you may want to consider blocking the site by using commercially available parental control software.
