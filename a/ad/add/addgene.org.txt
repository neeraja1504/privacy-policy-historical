3. ### _How does Addgene collect Financial Information?
When you are requesting materials through Addgene, you will be prompted for your payment information. You can choose to pay by credit card or purchase order. If you choose to pay by credit card, you will be redirected to USAePay’s payment portal. As noted above Addgene does not process nor store your credit card information.
If you choose to pay by purchase order, you will enter in that information at “checkout.” If you choose to submit payment information later, we will follow up with you via email to obtain that information.
Why does Addgene need that information?
Why does Addgene need your Personal Information?
With regards to Personal Information collected during account creation, Addgene needs that information because it is necessary:
1. to create the contract (the material transfer agreement) that governs the sharing of materials between your organization and the sharing organization(s). [View a template of one such contract here](https://media.addgene.org/cms/filer_public/60/0f/600f7aae-78c3-4970-a4b2-f3a7b5e28661/sample_request_mta_implementing_letter.pdf);
2. to comply with legal obligations to which Addgene is subject, including our inability to ship to certain countries, entities and individuals pursuant to U.S. export control regulations; our inability to distribute materials to industry organizations pursuant to our contractual obligations; and our obligation to track, record and report material distributions to the applicable material rights holders; and
3. to perform / carry out our mission as a nonprofit repository that helps scientists around the world by, amongst other things, serving as an archive for their scientific research materials, data, protocols and other research information.
With regards to Personal Information collected for specific purposes, such as our newsletter, ebooks, and blogs, we use this information:
1. to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/), with respect to your communications on our Site;
2. to provide you with your requested access of the service (i.e., the newsletter, ebook); and
3. to pursue our mission-based interests of developing educational and technical resources for specific scientific fields and users.
Why does Addgene need Technical Information?
The Technical Information that we collect when you visit our website is necessary to support many of its basic features such as logged-in sessions. We also may occasionally use the Technical Information in the aggregate with similar information from other users in order to help us evaluate users’ experiences and improve our website.
Why does Addgene need Financial Information?
We need payment assurance for the materials that you have requested. This can be in the form of verification from our payment gateway service or a verifiable, purchase order number. Our Standard Terms of Purchase can be found here.
How does Addgene use (or “process”) that information?
How does Addgene process Personal Information?
Addgene processes Personal Information collected at account creation as follows:
1. Contracts (Material Transfer Agreements “MTA”) \- The contractual components needed to execute an MTA between organizations sharing materials are the names of the scientists sharing materials, the names of the organizations, the names of the principal investigators (i.e., the heads of the labs in which materials are used/originate) (if different from the sharing scientists), and the addresses of the labs and organizations.
2. Export Controls \- Addgene checks your name, organization and country against various export control lists, provided by the U.S. government, to determine whether we can conduct business with you.
3. Contractual Restrictions \- Many of the materials deposited with Addgene may only be distributed to academic, nonprofit, research organizations. This is why we need to know what type of organization you are registering.
4. Records and Reporting \- Because Addgene facilitates the sharing of materials between organizations, these organizations rely on Addgene (via contract) to track, record and report materials and executed material transfer agreements on their behalf. Records of all material transfers are available to the sharing organizations’ administrative offices via their accounts and email; and reports of material transfers are delivered to the sharing organizations’ administrators’ emails. Additionally, Addgene tracks, records and reports your specific lab’s material transfers. These records are available in your Addgene account and reports are mailed to your email at a daily, monthly or yearly frequency of your choosing.
5. Archival and Scientific Purposes \- Since its inception, Addgene has been [dedicated](https://web.archive.org/mission/) to helping scientists share their materials. We are accomplishing this by operating a nonprofit, materials repository on behalf of the global, research community. Scientists looking to store, archive or share their materials can do so by depositing their materials with us ([see here for benefits of depositing](https://web.archive.org/deposit/)). Scientists looking for certain materials discussed in a publication or by the depositing scientist at a conference, for example, can search our database by the publication, scientist name or material characteristics.
Addgene processes Personal Information collected for specific purposes as follows:
1. Site Enforcement \- In the event that you choose to engage in inappropriate conduct on our Site, as discussed in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/), we will restrict, block or ban your access as we deem appropriate.
2. Access/Deliverables \- We will use your email address to send you notices of blog updates, electronic ebook copies and subsequent updates, newsletters etc., if you have chosen to opt-in to receive them.
3. Content Creation \- We will use your title and field of study, in an aggregated manner, to determine what type of content interests our users and the type of users we should be gearing content toward.
