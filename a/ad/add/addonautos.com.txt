Privacy Policy | Reynolds and Reynolds
This privacy policy applies to all websites that are specifically identified as belonging to us (“our websites”). It also applies to our websites for our products or consumer technologies. They may also have their own privacy policies, specific to those products or services.
This policy only applies to personal information we collect on our own behalf. It does not apply to information we collect on behalf of our business clients. Nor does it apply to data from our clients who use our hosted information.
Our websites may link to websites from other companies or organizations. We are not responsible for their privacy practices of those other parties. Also, we are not responsible for the content or operation of their websites.

Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to help analyze how our users use the site. Google Analytics uses cookies to store information about your use of the website, including your IP address. That information is sent to Google, where we access it for reports. We use these reports to review visitors’ use of the website.

We also have implemented the following Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising:
Remarketing with Google Analytics
Google Display Network Impression Reporting
DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration
Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting
Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads across the internet. We use ad-tracking, along with third-party vendors. These use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie). Together, these cookies report if you have seen our ads (ad impressions) and how you have interacted with our ads and ad services. We want this information so we can make sure any of our advertising that you see is relevant to you.
