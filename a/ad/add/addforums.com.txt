ADD Forums is the sole owner of all information collected from our site.
Our server automatically logs information about our visitors, including but not limited to IP address, the page(s) they visited, their HTTP referrer, their browser and version, age groups, geographic location, the duration of their visit, etc. No personally identifiable is available to any third parties.
Additionally, users are required to register to use our message board software. During registration, users are required to provide certain information, including an email address and a password.

"Personal Messages" or "Private Messages" sent and received using our message board software are considered private. "Private messages" and "Personal messages" are still subject to the same rules and regulations that govern the public areas of the message boards (i.e. harrassment, misconduct, advertising), and said rules will be enforced, if a complaint is received.
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, ADD Forums, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, our homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (i.e. email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate users accounts or personally identifiable information. This can be done by e-mailing addforums@gmail.com.
