Informatica Privacy Policy | Informatica
Last Updated : August 12, 2019
This Privacy Policy explains how Informatica LLC, Informatica Ireland EMEA UC and their respective subsidiaries (“Informatica”) collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Informatica, contact us for customer support or visit our premises, facilities or offices (collectively, our “facilities”). Please note that third parties host the e-commerce platforms of our Services that accept payment cards: Digital River, Inc. (Informatica Marketplace), Zuora, Inc. (Informatica Cloud Express), and Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. (Informatica Education Services). As a result, any information you provide in connection with a purchase made via the Services will be collected by these third parties and governed by the third parties’ separate privacy policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information processed by Informatica about its employees or job applicants, which is governed by a separate personnel privacy notice. It also does not apply to information processed by Informatica on behalf of its customers via the Services, as further described in Informatica’s data processing agreement available on the Informatica Legal Information Website at https://www.informatica.com/content/dam/informatica-com/en/docs/legal/online-data-processing-agreement.pdf.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our website homepages or sending you an email notification) or otherwise seek additional consent in accordance with applicable law. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
