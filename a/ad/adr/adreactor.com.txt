You can request that we correct your data. We will initiate appropriate measures to keep the data of yours that we continuously process correct, complete, and up to date, based the latest information available to us.
The right to erasure (to be forgotten)
You can request that we delete your data provided the legal requirements have been met. In accordance with Article 17 the GDPR, this can be the case if:
the data are no longer required for the purposes they were acquired or otherwise processed;
you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
you object to the processing of your data and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing or you object to data processing for the purposes of direct advertising;
