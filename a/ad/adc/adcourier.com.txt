It tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons", as explained below.
Cookies & Similar Technology
The Site also uses cookies to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide and, although they do identify a user's computer, they do not, of themselves, personally identify users.
Cookies are pieces of information that include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use will last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and last for longer.
We use cookies for the following reasons:
a) Necessary Session Management
Managing your login session so you can move easily from one page to another within the Site and your page requests are loaded in a smooth and secure manner;
b) Performance
Collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site;
remembering that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site and help optimise performance on the most visited areas;
c) Functionality
Storing your preferences and selections;
customising elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site for you;

Gathering information about the pages through our advertising partners, on the website that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment". This information is collected by reference to the IP address that you are using and so does not identify you personally, but does include information about the country and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based adverts on the website which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk or follow the link to the website of our advertising partners shown in the detailed cookie list below. Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests.

Web Beacons
Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected through web beacons. Broadbean also uses third party web beacons to help manage online advertising. These web beacons are provided by our ad management partner Google Analytics. These files enable Google Analytics to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie on your web browser was placed by Broadbean, or by another advertiser who works with Google Analytics. With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about Google Analytics, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to www.google-analytics.com.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
