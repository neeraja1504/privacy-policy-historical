Privacy Policy - RhythmMax
Unless otherwise indicated below, this privacy policy applies to any website that references this privacy policy or any RhythmMax website.  RhythmMax (“RhythmMax” or “we” or “us”), is committed to protecting your (“your” or “you” or “user”) privacy. This privacy policy describes how RhythmMax collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website. By using our website, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this privacy policy. Each time you visit our website and any time you voluntarily provide us with information, you agree that you are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and you are consenting to receive emails or otherwise be contacted, as described in this privacy policy. This privacy policy is incorporated into our terms of use. Whether or not you register or create any kind of account with us, this privacy policy applies to all users of the website.
Data Collection of User Information
All users are anonymous to RhythmMax . As ads are delivered, RhythmMax does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. RhythmMax does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. This non-personally identifying information can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, sites you have visited, products you have researched and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of RhythmMax's advertisers.  There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, registration questionnaire or the like. For such programs, RhythmMax (or a third party working in conjunction with RhythmMax and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser. The adviser uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. RhythmMax may aggregate this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically.  This provides the advertiser precise profiles of the types of individuals that respond to the ads.
Use of Health Related Information
RhythmMax is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data. RhythmMax does not collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information" includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic and family medical history. RhythmMax maintains internal policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or use of such information.  RhythmMax may use general health related information with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not considered "sensitive consumer information." This information can include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based on previous visit to an advertiser's website, retargeting based upon the visit to a general health, fitness, wellness or nutrition website, or retargeting based on your visit to a website where interest can be inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a visit to an infant car-seat review page.
P3P
The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for ad networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An ad network or website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's visitors. A visitor's web browser can download the machine-readable privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't match. RhythmMax has incorporated this technology in its ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.
Cookies
RhythmMax may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the purpose of identifying your web browser. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on tour computer until you delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive experience with the website. When you are served a RhythmMax ad, RhythmMax may assign various information in a cookie on ads you've seen, information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.
RhythmMax collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of analyzing Addendum campaign results, ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and preventing fraud across our sites.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website or our member sites.

These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The information collected can include the date/time of your visit, the banner ad that was shown, your unique user ID, your IP address, the URLs of sites you visit.  This information can also be used for online preference marketing ("profiling") purposes.
