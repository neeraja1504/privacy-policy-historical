Privacy policy for AnyMind Group websites
AnyMind Group has adopted these privacy principles for the organization’s online properties, including anymindgroup.com, adasiaholdings.com, casting-asia.com, talentmind.ai and moments-asia.com.
AnyMind Group and its subsidiaries are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established jointly by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.
This notice also explains your rights as someone who may provide personal data to AnyMind Group through the Websites and how to exercise these rights. If you are an individual residing in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland you should be aware that our DPO can contacted at dpo@anymindgroup.com.
The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide clear notice about the user information we may collect online in connection with AnyMind Group’s online properties (including forementioned websites).
The next few sections below describe how we collect user information in connection with the operation of our online properties, such as through advertisements that may appear on various websites on the Internet. Therefore, certain information collection by AnyMind Group through the use of cookies, as described below, may occur on numerous websites across the Internet.
For information on how we collect and use information that is collected directly on this website, please see the section entitled "Information We Collect".
We use some or all of this information to improve your website experience by delivering content that you are likely to prefer on future visits. Our lawful basis for this type of processing is that we have a legitimate interest in understanding and improving your experience of our Website.
If you don’t agree to us using cookies and the above information, you may prevent their use through your browser settings or you may choose to opt out at https://www.youradchoices.com/. By choosing not to accept cookies, certain Website features may not work as we have intended.
Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from users online through advertisements unless users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example. PII generally refers to identifying information such as an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.
Non-Personal Information Collected
We do collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII) to identify computers that we have interacted with before. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a computer that has previously seen an advertisement by us. In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to ‘you' or ‘yours,' please remember that we may be referring to a computer and not an identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a computer at any particular time.
Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we have a range of services to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements. For example, if a user is interested in advertising solutions, then we may deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of advertising solution. You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting www.iab.net/privacymatters.
We may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements. We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis. Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the computer's Internet protocol ("IP") address, the domain name of the websites visited before and after viewing an advertisement, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown.
We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technologies. A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and computer. A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser. The use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page. Additional Non-PII from an earlier period or interaction may be included in the pixel. Though Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect.
