We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the Website. This information includes your name, email address and a password when you create your ADE Account. While you can browse our online store without opening an account, you will need to create an account in order to make purchases and take advantage of certain features. We may also ask for personal information when you contact Customer Service. This will allow us to protect your confidentiality by verifying your identity.
The Website contains sexually-oriented adult material and they are not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. ADE does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals under 18 years of age who visit the Website. If a person under 18 years of age has provided ADE with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian immediately contact Customer Service for assistance.

When you make a purchase using a credit card, we collect your name and billing address for the card, the card type, number, and expiration date. We collect this information in order to verify your billing address. We also collect information that allows us to ship your purchase and keep you informed of the status of your order.

If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from ADE please click on Your Account click on "Notification Options" and remove the check in the box next to the "Sales & Specials" notification option. You can also opt-out of receiving these messages by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the email message itself.

We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.
6. How we protect the security of your personal information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.
ADE has also obtained a digital certificate from DigiCert®, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a ADE Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password that you entered when you created a ADE account (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to Your Account, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.
7. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice, and we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement as to all such updated or modified Privacy Policies. By using or visiting the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, then do not use or visit the Website.
8. How to contact ADE
