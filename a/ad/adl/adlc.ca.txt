We collect, use, and disclose personal information to provide you with the product or service you have requested and to offer you additional products and services we believe you might be interested in. The purposes for which we collect personal information will be identified before or at the time we collect the information. In certain circumstances, the purposes for which the information is being collected may be clear, and consent may be implied, such as when your name, address, and payment information is provided as part of the ordering process.

Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information except where required by law. Providing us with your personal information is always your choice. However, if you decide not to provide certain information, our ability to provide you with our products or services may be limited. We will not require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information as a condition to supplying a product or service unless we are unable to supply the product or service without it.

Personal information may be used or disclosed only for the purpose for which it was collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is required by law. Personal information will be retained only for the period of time required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected it or as required by law.
