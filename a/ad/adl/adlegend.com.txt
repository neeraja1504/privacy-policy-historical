Privacy on This Website (Trueffect.com)
This website (Trueffect.com) serves primarily as our interface with our market and customers, and we use it to showcase best practices in privacy and data security:
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Unlike our advertising platform, site visitors may voluntarily provide personal information in certain areas on this website as well as at industry events, trade shows or other forums. The personal information we collect is used only for the purpose for which it is requested:
Information Requests : Potential clients or business partners provide information so that we can contact them with requested information about our products and services. Upon request Trueffect will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. This information may be stored on our servers in the United States, and can be amended or deleted upon request. Please contact info@trueffect.com or via postal mail at the contact information listed below to update or remove this information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Support Requests : Name, address, telephone number, or email address information submitted by existing customers with support questions or other feedback is used only for that purpose, and may be stored on our servers in the United States. Please contact info@trueffect.com to update or remove this information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
Choice/Opt-Out :You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at info@trueffect.com.
Data Retention: We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at info@trueffect.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Data Collection
Log Information
As with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, track user’s movements around websites/mobile devices to which we provide advertisements and to gather demographic information about users who interact with our services as a whole. This information does not allow us to determine specific identities.
Device Information
We may employ the use of Device Identifiers to better manage advertising on websites/mobile devices by informing us (without using cookies) of the content with which users interact. Statistical Identifiers collect information about user devices, such as browser type and operating system. Many devices have unique or near unique device profiles, so collecting this information enables us to determine to a reasonable level of statistical accuracy the level of user’s engagement with advertisements and to recognize the user devices that interact with content. We do not tie the information gathered through the use of Statistical Identifiers to user’s personal information.
Sometimes we may use or make available to clients the non-PII we collect or receive (such as IP Address) to recognize users or try to resolve a commonality of users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers. For instance, we might infer that a common IP address seen across different devices represents a common user (or a related or similar user), and use that inference in tailoring ads.
Location Data
Trueffect can recognize a consumer’s location while they are in use of the device and this location information can be utilized by Trueffect to deliver advertisements. As with all data Trueffect collects, this is non-personally identifiable information (Non PII) and is limited to non-precise as defined by the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) current definition of imprecise location data.
Behavioral Advertising
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Information Sharing or Disclosure
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may use the services of external technology vendors to collect or fulfill requests for information or other services on our behalf, in which event personal information may come to reside on servers belonging to our authorized partners, but these third parties are required to implement similar security measures and to process your information only as authorized by Trueffect to fulfill the service(s) that they have been contracted to provide.
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If Trueffect is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Security
The security of your personal information is important to us.

Privacy and First-Party Ad Serving
The majority of our customers deploy our technology within their own domain, allowing them serve ads within the terms and conditions of their existing privacy policies and practices. Unlike other technologies, TruEffect’s patented first-party ad serving allows them to do this without revealing either personal or non-personal data to any third party.
Our customers use their own cookies for this purpose, and must adhere to Trueffect privacy policies and industry best practices. Because of the inherent privacy and security of first-party ad serving, it can only be managed by the advertiser with whom you have a relationship. All of our first-party ad serving clients maintain their own privacy policies and govern the necessary opt-out mechanisms for their own secure, closed advertising networks.
Material Changes to this Privacy Policy
While this privacy policy will always be clearly posted, up-to-date, and compliant with current best practices, we may amend it from time to time as standards and practices within the industry evolve, or as we add new products and services, or update our product offerings. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
If all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, previously volunteered customer and prospect information may be transferred as well, along with the conditions and requirements under which it was originally collected and managed.
