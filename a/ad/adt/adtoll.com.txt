U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Privacy Policy
Clickbooth.com, LLC (“Clickbooth”) recognizes that privacy is very important to our clients and business partners, and we pledge to protect the security and privacy of any personal information that clients and business partners provide to us. This includes clients’ and business partners’ personally identifiable information. Not only does Clickbooth strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. This US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that Clickbooth follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Union (EU) to the United States.
SAFE HARBOR
The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that ensures adequate protection for personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States (the "US-EU Safe Harbor"). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection. Consistent with our commitment to protect personal privacy, Clickbooth adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor.
SCOPE
This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to all personal information received by Clickbooth in the United States from the EU, in any format including electronic, paper or verbal.
DEFINITIONS
The following definitions shall apply throughout this Policy:"Agent" means any third party that uses personal information provided to Clickbooth to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of Clickbooth."Clickbooth" means Clickbooth.com, LLC, and each of its predecessors, successors and affiliates."Personal information" means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Clickbooth to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded, anonymous, aggregated or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information."Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, Clickbooth will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to Clickbooth, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Clickbooth uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
If Clickbooth receives personal information from other entities in the EU, it will use such information in accordance with the notices such entities provided and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.
CHOICE: Clickbooth will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.For sensitive personal information, Clickbooth will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.Clickbooth will provide individuals with reasonable methods to exercise their choices.

If Clickbooth has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, Clickbooth will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.
ACCESS AND CORRECTION: Upon request, Clickbooth will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them, and Clickbooth will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
SECURITY: Clickbooth will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
