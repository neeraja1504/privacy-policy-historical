We will also explain how you can manage your privacy choices and exercise your rights to your data.

Your choice
You can opt out of receiving the tailored advertisements shown by our Clients from the Platform in your current browser. To opt-out or opt-in please visit the following pages: adhigh.net, digitmate.bid, cpagen.win
Please note that Cookies and other device IDs are different on different browsers and devices, this ‘opt-out’ only applies to this browser and this device.
What we do
GetIntent is an advertising technology company.
Our Clients include advertising agencies and corporate businesses that use our Platform to manage their advertising campaigns. GetIntent does not provide services directly to any consumers.
We own and operate the Platform, and we offer our Clients the Services to remotely access and buy advertising spaces on the Sites.
The Platform provides a tool to the Client to buy the most relevant advertising spaces corresponding to the parameters of the Client’s advertising campaign submitted by the Client to the Platform. We also provide a technology that enables the delivery of the advertisement to the Site.
This is how it works. The Sites send to the Platform notices (bid requests) when an advertising space becomes available. Each bid request contains the description of the interests of the audience that is likely to see the advertisement. The Platform compares the description of the audience under the bid request with the parameters of the Client’s advertising campaign. If they match, the Platform provides a tool to the Client to automatically make a transaction to buy such advertising space and deliver the advertisement to the Site.
As a result, the Client will show the advertisements to the users who are likely to have an interest in the Client’s advertisements. The Platform helps to make online advertising more relevant and not generic and consequently helps to keep Internet meaningful and free. The advertisers are likely to pay more when their ads are tailored to the audience’s interests, which may allow the publishers to provide their content to the users for free.
The Platform also includes other tools to measure the effectiveness of the Client’s advertising campaign and to prevent fraudulent activities and malware. The Services provided and operated by GetIntent USA Inc
Do we collect personal data
We do not collect personal data that identifies you (an Internet user) in the ‘real world’. When you visit a Site, we do not know your name or email address or any information that directly identifies you. We take care to ensure that we do not collect any information that tells us who you are.
When the Sites send to the Platform bid requests (as explained in section What we do above), these bid requests may include some information about you including IP address, unique device identifiers, and the latitude and longitude of your device when you view a Site or use an App.
This information (including IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers) may identify a particular computer or device, and this type of information is considered ‘personal data’ in the European Union.
When we receive such personal data from the Sites we act as independent controller (and never as a joint controller with the Site).
What data is processed
We may also process certain data for and on behalf of our Clients relating to the interaction of the users with the Sites:
The type of browser used by a user, and its settings;
Information about the device operating system;
Information about Cookie IDs and other device IDs;
IP addresses from which a device interacts with the Site; IP addresses may be encrypted as required by applicable laws;
Information about the user’s activity on a Site, including time of activity and URL;
Information about the approximate geographic location (city, region, post code) of the device when it accesses a Site derived from the IP address information or GPS data.
The Platform may receive the data from third parties for the use by its Clients in their advertising campaigns on the Platform; in doing so we will always act strictly in accordance with the permissions and restrictions imposed by the third party providing the data.
When our Clients use the Platform, they may also use their data received from other sources (not from GetIntent) and other data that identifies the Client that is collected as a result of or generated by the Client’s use of the Platform (Client Data). When GetIntent receives the Client Data, in legal terms GetIntent processes the Client Data on behalf of the Client (GetIntent acts as a data processor, and GetIntent is bound by the instructions of the Client when GetIntent processes such Client Data. The Client gives instructions to GetIntent through the Client’s interface of the Platform, and the Client’s instructions are recorded in the Platform’s logs. It is the Client’s obligation to ensure that all Client Data used on the Platform is collected and used by the Clients in the lawful way. While this notice may also explain how the Clients may use the Client Data when using the Platform, this notice does not apply to the use of the Client Data outside of the Platform.
For the purpose of providing the Service, GetIntent collects and processes the data used by the Platform for bidding and delivery (bid requests), the data derived from or generated by the use of the Platform and the data relating to any error, issue or enhancement to the operation or use of the Platform.
In order to provide the Services, we may process the following data:
Cookie ID / Pixel ID
The Platform generates a unique device ID for every new device that interacts with a Site. The unique device ID is included in a Cookie stored in the user’s browser. By default, the Cookie expires [30 days] after the last interaction. [The device ID is usually generated as a random number or sometimes combined with an ID generated by the browser and device configuration.]
Mobile Advertising ID
Mobile Advertising ID is a technical ID on a smartphone operating system (for example Android and Apple IOS), that is under the control of the user and owner of that device, and the user can reset this ID at any time.
Cross-Device IDs
Cross-Device user ID is generated by the Platform by using its algorithms in order to try to link devices and identifiers belonging to the same user.
Partner IDs
Our Platform may automatically exchange pseudonymous IDs with our business partners. These IDs are strictly pseudonymous on both sides.
How data is processed
Our Platform uses the following technologies to process the data about web-browsers and devices across the Sites and over time:
Cookies. A Cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web-browser by a Site or a Client through the Platform. By saving information in a Cookie, the Sites and Clients can remember preferences or recognize web-browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another. The Clients may also use alternative methods with the functions similar to Cookies in order to identify unique browsers or devices. For example, Apple iOS and Google Play Services for Android provide unique IDs for advertising.
Beacons, pixels, tags, mobile SDKs. Beacons (including clear GIFs or 1×1 pixels) and tags are items included in a webpage that enable the Clients to collect data, serve advertisements, and measure ad effectiveness or prevent fake ad traffic. They do this by allowing communication between a web-browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent graphic that is placed on a webpage. A tag is a small element of the website code that is run by the web browser. An SDK is an element of the computer code included by the developers in the mobile applications.
We may also receive the data from our Clients or Sites via server-to-server connection, or via secure file transfer.
Use of Cookies
We may use Cookies for different purposes. When we refer to a term ‘Cookie’, we mean various device identifiers not limited to Cookies.
Cookies enable our Clients to serve targeted advertisements to the users, to evaluate how efficient are their advertisements, and to see the users’ opt-out choices.
The use of Cookies helps our Clients to recognise the web-browsers, and to store data for advertising purposes.
The use of Cookies allows us to store data about the delivery of ads for reporting purposes (for example which advertisement was shown, the frequency of an advertisement, and the last time an advertisement has been delivered to a particular browser).
How data is used
We use the data processed by the Platform for the purposes of providing the Services to the Clients, in particular
to analyse and report on advertising performance: the data processed is attributed to each certain advertising campaign of the Client, so the Client can monitor the performance of its advertising campaign;
to improve online advertising experience and efficiency: our Platform helps the Clients to decide which advertisement to show or whether to show it and to display the Client’s particular products in response to users’ interest;
to limit advertising exposure for consumers and facilitate more relevant advertising: for this purpose, we use Cross-Device IDs;
to satisfy end users opt-out requests based on the user’s choices stored in Cookies and other IDs;
to detect not ‘real’ traffic, and to prevent fraudulent activities including the use of robots, malware and other suspicious activities.
