Adult Policy
Under Indian law it may be a criminal offense for you to buy or sell certain types of films, publications and computer games.
As a guide, the following types of mature audience items may be illegal to buy or sell through posting of classifieds on the Site:
Films which do not have a certificate for public exhibition issued by the Central Board of Film Certification
Internationally released versions of Films, publications, or computer games that significantly differ from the domestic release;
Items that describe, depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults;
Items which contain an indecent representation of women within the meaning of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986;
Any publication or film or item that describes or depicts a minor who is, or who appears to be, under 18 (whether the minor is engaged in sexual activity or not). This material is generally described as child pornography;
In the case of computer games, that are unsuitable for a minor to see or play.
Apart from an item's classification, when considering whether a publication/item should be allowed on our Site, we consider the overall content of the listing, including pictures and text. For example, if an item description leads us to believe the content of the listing is not permitted as defined by this Policy, that item will be ended. Please note that blocking the questionable parts of an image will not exempt the item from these standards. Users who list classifieds relating to inappropriate items in this category may be suspended and are liable to be prosecuted.
Mature Audience/Sexually oriented material
Classifieds relating to items that are intended for use in a sexual setting (including "bondage" and "fetish" items,) display sexual activity or portray human genitalia in a "life-like" or realistic fashion are not allowed and will be ended by Rajiv. An example of such classifieds relating to an item not normally permitted would be a classified for the sale of a vibrator intended for use in sexual activity (massagers are OK). Please also be aware that titles with graphic adult language are inappropriate, regardless of the item contained in the listing itself.
i. Without prejudice to the generality of the above, Rajiv does not permit posting or listing of classifieds in relation to the following:

Rajiv offers this platform as a vehicle for communicating about non-work oriented topics of common interest – buying and selling things, community events, etc. Please don’t use it to discuss work-related topics, which should be handled through traditional channels. Note that postings are solely the responsibility of the individual poster, and Rajiv does not endorse any posting or point of view expressed on this Site.
