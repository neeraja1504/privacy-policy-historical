Terms and Conditions | AdvoCare
Updated: February 8th 2018
AdvoCare endeavors to maintain the security of the private and personal information you may provide on this site as well as through its online properties and mobile applications. This policy also applies to personal information that AdvoCare collects through offline methods, such as when a Distributor submits a Distributorship application to us, or when a customer calls our Customer Service team. AdvoCare may use information it receives from Distributors about their customers. Unless otherwise indicated, this policy does not apply to a Distributor's collection or use of information obtained by the Distributor directly from a customer.
AdvoCare uses the information it collects and receives for a variety of purposes, including: providing customers with products, services, and requested support; processing transactions; shipping orders; communications about AdvoCare accounts or transactions; changes to policies and other administrative matters; to answer questions or comments; to better understand your interests in order to provide you with promotional information, relevant content, surveys, questionnaires, and other materials consistent with applicable law and choices and controls you may have; improving our products, services, and operations; and ensuring compliance with our policies, rules and the law, or as we believe is necessary to enforce or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of ourselves and others. We also use this information to validate sales by AdvoCare Distributors and for AdvoCare's compliance purposes. AdvoCare or its authorized third parties may contact individuals directly for these purposes.
We work diligently and take reasonable steps to protect the security of your personal information, including credit card information, during transmission by using security software that encrypts data. This data is kept in a highly secure environment protected from access by unauthorized parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant its complete security. To protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer, it is important that you log off when you are finished visiting any of AdvoCare's online properties.
In order to further AdvoCare’s business, we may share a Registered Retail Customer, Distributor or Preferred Customer’s contact information with their designated Distributor, Sponsor and/or Mentors, who may contact them to answer any questions they might have concerning the products they ordered or their AdvoCare business. Sponsors and Mentors are able to help new Distributors receive AdvoCare service and attention. We may also share organizational report information that contains information on other Distributors and Preferred Customers in an AdvoCare Distributor's downline (individuals personally sponsored by the designated Distributor, and in turn, all other persons sponsored by the subsequent Distributors on their team). These reports are provided to Distributors in strict confidence and for the sole purpose of supporting the Distributors in further developing their AdvoCare businesses. If you are a customer, we may share your information with Distributors. AdvoCare Distributors who receive customer information are bound by the terms of their Distributorship Agreement and the privacy and data protection covenants contained therein. AdvoCare will take reasonable measures to ensure that the information is kept in confidence. We may also share information with our vendors that perform functions on our behalf as well as select partners. These entities may use your information to make predictions about your interests and may provide you with email, telephone and text communications, special officers, promotions, advertisements, and other materials related to AdvoCare and its business. We may also share information to third parties in other ways when you consent to such sharing.
AdvoCare may communicate with you via email, postal mail, telephone or other means on a regular basis to provide requested products and services and/or in regards to issues relating to your relationship with AdvoCare. Additionally, if you subscribe to certain newsletter(s), you may receive periodic information on AdvoCare's business, products, services, special promotions, and the AdvoCare Foundation. Anyone may stop receiving these kinds of communications by following the instructions provided in the communication(s).
Please note that this policy applies only to official AdvoCare website(s), applications, and offline methods and not to online forums of other third parties to which AdvoCare may provide links. AdvoCare has no control of sites operated and maintained by third parties, and any information you provide may be publically accessed, read, collected and used by others who access them. AdvoCare has no responsibility or liability for the content or policies of third-party sites, and the inclusion of links to third-party sites on AdvoCare online properties, applications, and offline methods in no way constitutes an endorsement of such websites' content, actions, or policies.
