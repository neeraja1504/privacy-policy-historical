with your Personal Information. We may collect the following types of Personal Information:
•    Contact Information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, username,
mailing address, telephone numbers, email address or other addresses that allow us to send you

2. How AdvancedMD collects Personal Information
In many cases, we collect Personal Information directly from you. We will ask you for Personal
Information (including Contact Information and Relationship Information) when you interact with us, such
as registering on our websites, signing up to receive a newsletter, or making a purchase. We may collect
additional Relationship Information from third party data suppliers who enhance our files and help us better
understand our customers.

Information when it is associated with your Contact Information. For more information about cookies and
other technologies, please see the section Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies below.
3. How AdvancedMD uses Personal Information
AdvancedMD uses your Personal Information to:
•    Fulfill your requests for products or services and for related activities, such as product and service
delivery, customer service, account management, support and training and to provide other
services related to your relationship with AdvancedMD;
•    Provide you with marketing communications and offers for products and services from
AdvancedMD and, in some cases, our partners, including offers targeted based on your interests,
business characteristics and location;
•    Administer surveys and other promotional events;
•    Determine if you are eligible for certain products, services or offers;

and legal compliance, and business continuity.
Why Personal Information is disclosed by AdvancedMD
AdvancedMD understands that you do not want to us to provide your Personal Information to third parties
for their own marketing purposes. We limit our sharing of your Personal Information as follows:
•    We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, which may only use your Personal
Information for the purposes listed above.
•    We may also share your Personal Information with our service providers, who are bound by law or
contract to protect your Personal Information and only use your Personal Information in
accordance with our instructions.
•    We may share your Personal Information with business partners if you have purchased products or
services from such partner, interacted with such partner, or otherwise indicated interest in that
partner’s products or services. For example, if you are referred to AdvancedMD from a business
partner website, we may provide that partner with your Contact Information and certain
Transactional Information to validate the referral. We may also provide your Contact Information
to companies that offer complementary products and services if you request information about
these solutions.
•    We may also disclose Personal Information where needed to affect the sale or transfer of business
assets, to enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property or safety of others,
or as needed to support external auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions. We
will also always disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response
to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other
countries where we operate.
Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For
example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our clients. These
reports do not contain any information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you.
These reports also do not contain any identifiable company information.
Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies and Google Analytics
When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or email with us, we collect certain Transaction
Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools,
server logs and web beacons.
For example, when you visit our website, we place cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files
that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or
to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They
also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. In many cases,
you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies
used by adjusting the settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of
your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.
AdvancedMD does not use Flash cookies or similar technologies for behavioral or interest-based
advertising purposes.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us
to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click
an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure
response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may
collect information from the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser
type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time
zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address assigned to the device you use
to connect to the internet. An IP address is a unique number that devices use to identify and communicate
with each other on the internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before
you came to AdvancedMD and the website you visit after you leave our site.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable
way, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about all
website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.
In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your
Personal Information. This Privacy Statement applies to the information when we associate it with your
Personal Information.
AdvancedMD has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on this
website and other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for this website and other
websites. These third party advertising companies may place cookies on your computer when you visit our
website or other websites so they can display targeted advertisements to you. These third party advertising
companies do not collect Personal Information in this process, and we do not give any Personal Information
to them as part of this process. However, this Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or
use of the information collected by these vendors. For more information about third party advertising,
please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at networkadvertising.org. You can opt out of being
targeted by many third party advertising companies by visiting
networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp or http://preferences.truste.com/truste/.

California Privacy Rights

time across web sites owned or operated by different entities for purposes of delivering advertising based
on preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected) for use by AdvancedMD or our
clients for advertising purposes (often referred to as Online Behavioral Advertising or OBA).
AdvancedMD does, however, use third-party advertising vendors that use first-and third-party cookies to
gather information as individuals interact with AdvancedMD websites and other websites.
You may set your computer's internet browser settings so you will be notified when you receive any third
party cookie, which includes AdvancedMD cookies, and be given the choice to block the cookie. In
addition, there are also other controls within certain browsers or available through third parties that enables
more extensive blocking of cookies. Some new browsers have a 'do-not-track' feature. When this feature is
turned on, AdvancedMD treats this as if you had opted out of our online advertising products. To learn how
to manage your browser based settings and cookies, please visit:
