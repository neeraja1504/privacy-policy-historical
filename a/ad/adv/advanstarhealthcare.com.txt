Social security numbers are not publicly displayed, used as the primary account number or identifier for an individual or printed on identification cards or badges
Social security numbers are not used, transmitted or stored in documents, files, computer programs or databases that are not encrypted or secure

This Privacy Policy does not prohibit the collection or use of social security numbers belonging to customers, creditors, contractors, vendors, employees and other individuals associated with Advanstar for other legitimate business reasons, including, without limitation:
The conduct by Advanstar of pre-employment background, reference and related inquiries
For purposes of verifying employment candidates’ eligibility for employment by Advanstar
For employee tax reporting purposes, including new hire reporting and enrollment and participation in Advanstar benefit plans
For tax reporting purposes pertaining to customers, creditors, contractors, vendors and other individuals providing goods or services to Advanstar
Unauthorized Use or Disclosure
Advanstar will take commercially reasonable measures to enforce this Privacy Policy and to correct and prevent the reoccurrence of any known violations. Non-compliance with this Privacy Policy may constitute a violation of federal and state law, and Advanstar will fully cooperate with all law enforcement and administrative agencies in the apprehension and prosecution of any person who knowingly obtains, uses or discloses social security numbers for any unlawful purpose. Willful violation of this Privacy Policy by Advanstar employees will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
