To Serve You:
We may use your personal information to respond to your inquiries and provide the products and services you request. When you respond to a promotion or service offering, we will provide the specific materials you request as well as communications about related products, brands, health topics and disease states. We also use your information to deliver the content and services we believe you will find the most relevant. For example, a female user may receive information on products targeted at women that a male user will not see; a user who we know is a healthcare professional who treats arthritis may receive information relating to new arthritis therapies. In addition, we may use personal identifiers to recognize you when you arrive at the Site via an external link, e.g. , such as a link appearing on a third party site or in an email Pfizer has presented to you. See also our Cookies and Other Tools section below. We will also use your information to provide customer service and support.
To Serve Third Parties You Ask Us to Serve:
Our websites may offer various tools and functionality. Some of these are provided by Pfizer while others are provided by third parties. For example, Pfizer may provide functionality on the Site that will allow you to forward and share certain content with a friend or colleague. In addition, the Site may also offer third party sharing functionality such as third party social media widgets/tools/buttons. If you choose to use Pfizer sharing functionality to refer someone to our content, products or services, we will use your information and that of the individual you are sharing with to send the content or link you request, but we do not access, store or use the information relating to the individual you wish to share with other than in connection with your request. If you use third party sharing functionality, including social media widgets/tools/buttons, such use is subject to the third party’s privacy policy and terms. As with all links to non-Pfizer websites/content/services, we recommend that you read the privacy policies and terms associated with these third party properties carefully.
To Validate Your Ability to Access / Use Certain Products, Services and Information:
Some products, services and information we offer may only be suitable for/ accessible to individuals meeting certain eligibility or other criteria.

Pfizer will honor those Special Program Terms with respect to your personal information. Some of these Special Programs may involve sharing information with a third party and Pfizer will provide you with notice of this. You may be offered the opportunity to agree to or opt-out of the sharing of your information with such third party. But, in some instances, it may be necessary to agree to sharing with a third party in order to participate in a particular Special Program. If you consent/do not opt-out, we will share your information with the third party; and the personal information you provide may be used by the third party in accordance with the Special Program Terms and, unless provided otherwise in such Special Program Terms, for their own purposes in accordance with their own policies/terms.

Online Behavioral Advertising and the Advertising Option Icon
Pfizer hopes to deliver to you advertising for products and services you need or want. There are many ways to do this in the online advertising world. For example, Pfizer partners with websites with whom you have shared your interests, conditions and concerns directly and asks that they serve our ads to users who have expressed an interest in Pfizer products or health conditions that our products treat. We may also partner with advertising companies to serve you ads based on your web browsing activity, purchases and/or interests. Some techniques for delivering content based on your interests are referred to as online behavioral advertising ( _ “OBA” ). You can read more about OBA at a site offered by the advertising industry’s Digital Advertising Alliance ( _ “DAA” ), aboutads.info.
We want it to be easy for you to understand how we and our business partners use information to serve ads tailored for you and to opt-out from targeting based on OBA. To this end, we have licensed the DAA Advertising Options icon, , and agreed to adhere to the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for OBA. We also provide you with an easy-to-use means of opting-out from the use of your information for OBA. In addition, we offer plain English explanations of our practices in this Privacy Policy, in our Ad Choices Notice (displayed on our Sites on which data is collected for OBA purposes), and in our ads served using OBA. If you have any questions about our use of OBA or participation in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program, please do not hesitate to contact us at Privacy.Officer@pfizer.com.
In addition to the browser options and opt-out choices described in this policy, we are monitoring the development of do not track ("DNT") options for consumers and will consider adoption of this standard when it is finalized. At this time, we do not change our practices in response to DNT browser settings. For information about DNT, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.

Security Policies
We use technical, administrative and procedural measures in an attempt to safeguard your personal and other information from unauthorized access or use. No such measure is ever 100% effective though, so we do not guarantee that your personal and other information will be secure from theft, loss, or unauthorized access or use, and we make no representation as to the reasonableness, efficacy, or appropriateness of the measures we use to safeguard such information. Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us at Privacy.Officer@pfizer.com.

Your Privacy Choices and Updates
You may always update your personal information and your preferences. Limited communications may be necessary in order for you to participate in a particular program or service.

These contact options are typically available on our Sites or in the emails or texts we send but you may always contact our Privacy Officer for assistance at Privacy.Officer@pfizer.com if you have any difficulty finding these tools or otherwise updating your information or preferences.
