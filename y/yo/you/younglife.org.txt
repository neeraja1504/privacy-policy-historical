Information Related to ​Children
In general, Young Life websites are informational sites for parents and children about Young Life. It is our intention to provide a safe, fun environment where children and their parents may explore Young Life, their own Young Life club and other Young Life activities. None of Young Life’s websites knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13, except where personal information must be solicited from children and/or parents to facilitate participation in Young Life events or activities.
We care about children’s privacy and we take great care to safeguard the personal information of all children. We do not require a child to supply us with any personal information other than is necessary to participate in a specific activity, and we never condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. All personal information we do collect can only be accessed by authorized Young Life staff and volunteers, and only those people who require access may see this information for the purposes described above. We work diligently to preserve the confidentiality, security and integrity of that information.
As a ministry to children, Young Life is deeply committed to the safety and welfare of kids. We have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws and employ generally accepted best practices, especially as it relates to parental notice and consent. Parents have the right to request at any time that the information collected about their child be removed from Young Life’s networks and databases. You can contact Young Life at privacy@younglife.org.

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year.
