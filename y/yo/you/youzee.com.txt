Security measures
In response to the concern of Youzee about guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of your personal data, we have adopted the security standards demanded by the personal data protection regulations and we have also installed all technical means within our power in order to avoid the loss, misuse, alteration, unauthorised access or theft of the supplied personal data that is collected through the Platform. Nevertheless, you should bear in mind that security measures on the Internet are not impregnable.
Configuration of your profile
Youzee provides you with different privacy levels, so that you can determine the privacy of the information that you have decided to include in your profile. Therefore, you will be the person, under your sole responsibility, who decides who has access to your information.
As a Youzee user you will be able to control the privacy of your profile and its various elements at all times, for example: your photo, titles that you recommend to your friends, reviews that you publish and/or the visibility of your favourite titles. In the configuration of your profile we give you instructions on how to control your privacy on different levels, depending on the type of content and your different categories. You are the sole party responsible for the privacy level that you choose.
Please remember that, depending on the privacy level that you choose for your Youzee profile, only your friends on Youzee or on other social networks, or also other members of Youzee will be able to access your data and your profile information.
If Youzee adds extra privacy levels, you will be duly notified of them in compliance with the contents herein. Youzee shall not be responsible under any circumstances for any claim related to the security levels chosen or related to access to your information by other users.
Youzee does not control and therefore accepts no responsibility whatsoever for any possible collection and processing of users' information by other users or by third parties.
