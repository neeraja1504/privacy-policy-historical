This Privacy Shield Statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information. This Privacy Shield Statement applies to all personal information received by Kazoo whether in electronic, paper or verbal format.
Privacy Shield Definitions
“Personal Data” means information that (1) is trans­ferred from the EU or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.
“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosoph­ical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.
Privacy Shield Principles
Notice. Kazoo shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Data and the types of non-agent third parties to which Kazoo discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. Kazoo shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to Kazoo, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Kazoo uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. Kazoo may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Kazoo may collect your first and last name, shipping address, email address and Kazoo password, age, and credit card or other payment information that you choose to provide to Kazoo. We may ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the Service, or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you or your company, registering your entitlement to access certain special features, or to complete transactions. We also collect information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information to us and this is not a requirement for the use of the Service. Choice. Kazoo will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, Kazoo will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the informa­tion for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Kazoo shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.
Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of Kazoo may have access to your Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Kazoo or providing or enabling elements of the Service. All such agents or contractors who have access to such information are required to keep the Information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Kazoo or as otherwise required by law.
Accountability for Onward Transfer. Prior to disclosing Personal Data to a non-agent third party, Kazoo shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. Kazoo shall ensure that any third party for which Personal Data may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or are subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agree in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection. Kazoo may be held responsible in cases of onward transfers to third parties.
Data Security. Kazoo shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Kazoo has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and manage­rial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Kazoo cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. Kazoo shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, Kazoo shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, com­plete, current and reliable for its intended use.
Access and Recourse. Kazoo acknowledges the right of Swiss and/or EU individuals to access their personal data. Individuals shall be allowed access to their Personal Data and be permitted to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Kazoo commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
