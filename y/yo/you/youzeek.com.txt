PRIVACY [] - on YOUZEEK.com
YOUZEEK LLC, a Delaware corporation (YOUZEEK, we or us) aims to create the ultimate music experience.
For this, we need to gather information from you, using your Facebook login. This policy ("YOUZEEK Privacy Policy") describes our online privacy practices and what personal information we may collect from you and what we will and will not do with that information.
How we collect and use personal information
When you sign up for a YOUZEEK account, you will be asked to use your Facebook account to log in. By doing this, you will share basic information from your Facebook account to your YOUZEEK profile. You can find more information about the Facebook privacy policy here: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php
In addition, when you use the YOUZEEK service, we will automatically collect information about your use of our service such as media you access, queries you make, date and time of your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version.
We will use your personal information to provide the products and services that you have requested (including the eventual display of customized content and advertising), to communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues, to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services.
If you are connected with your Facebook profile, you will share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture with your Facebook friend who log in to YOUZEEK with their Facebook account.
Further, the default setting is that all your playlists are visible to your Facebook friends using the YOUZEEK service. If you do not wish for such use of your personal data to take place, you should not connect to YOUZEEK with your Facebook account.

YOUZEEK will only share your personal information as is necessary to:

YOUZEEK processes personal information on servers in a number of countries. We may therefore transfer and process your personal information on a server outside the United States. However, we will use our best efforts to do so in accordance with this YOUZEEK Privacy Policy and applicable law.
Security
We take a number of steps to keep your personal information secure from unauthorized access. For example, we ask you to use a unique and strong password and not to share this information with anyone. In addition, we use encrypted transmissions to limit access to the systems that store your personal information. Further, we respect and comply with applicable laws and regulations on data protection. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your user access name and related password.
