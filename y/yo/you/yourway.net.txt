2. Cookies
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information ( not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

My advertising partners include, but are not limited to, Google AdSense, Burst Media and Amazon.com.
These third-party ad servers or ad networks sponsor advertisements and links on Life Your Way that are sent directly to your browsers. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see.
Life Your Way has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers, and our privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
