Privacy and Cookies Notice
Terms and Conditions of Use.
Welcome to YouGov UK.  The www.yougov.co.uk website (the "Website") and the YouGov mobile application(s) currently available on the Apple AppStore and Google Play e-stores (the “App”) are owned, operated and provided by YouGov Plc (a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03607311 whose registered office is at 50 Featherstone Street, London, EC1Y 8RT, United Kingdom)  (referred to as "YouGov", “we”, “our” or “us”).
Use of the Website and App including survey pages and content to which you may be directed (together the "YouGov WebPages") and membership of the consumer research panel set up and administered by YouGov (the "YouGov Panel") and participation in any YouGov research activities as described in our Privacy and Cookies Policy ("YouGov Activities") is governed by these terms and conditions of use (the "Terms").
Our group companies located in other countries operate panels in their respective countries for which different terms apply. If you are not registering with the YouGov Panel operated by YouGov Plc, please refer to the website of the panel operated by the relevant YouGov group company.
Please see our Privacy and Cookie Policy to understand how and why we collect your personal data, with whom we share it and the rights and choices you have over that data.
1. Acknowledgement and acceptance
1.1.         By ticking 'I agree' during the process to register your participation as a member of a YouGov Panel ("Member"), or by participating in a YouGov Activity or by simply accessing and using the YouGov WebPages, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Should you not wish to accept these Terms, you must exit the YouGov WebPages immediately and/or or cease participation in the YouGov Panel or YouGov Activities.
1.2.         YouGov reserves the right from time to time, to modify or amend these Terms or any part of them. You will be informed in advance of any changes in good time before they become effective and such changes will never vary your entitlement to points for surveys you have already completed prior to the effective date of the changes. Your continued use of the YouGov WebPages or continued participation in the YouGov Panel or the YouGov Activities once the changes take effect shall constitute an affirmative acknowledgement of any modification and your continued agreement to be bound by the modified Terms.
2. Terms of participation
2.1.          YouGov Registration Process for YouGov Panel Members
2.1.1.         To become a Member and to participate in a YouGov Panel, you need to register with YouGov and create a Panel Membership Profile following the registration process set out below (the "YouGov Registration Process").
2.1.2.         Prospective Members must complete a YouGov registration form each time they wish to join a YouGov Panel. Registration forms include:
2.1.2.1.      The form available on the Website and App, but may also include registration forms hosted on third party websites;
2.1.2.2.      Registration forms hosted by YouGov and accessed via third party websites; and
2.1.2.3.      Registration forms accessed via links in an email sent to you by a third party or by YouGov where you have granted permission to receive such emails from these sources.
2.1.4.         During each YouGov Registration Process prospective Members will be notified of any terms in addition to these Terms which shall apply to membership of the respective YouGov Panel.
2.1.5.         You have to be 16 years or older to join the YouGov Panel.
2.2.          Information you provide to us
2.2.1.         In return for YouGov granting you access to the YouGov WebPages and/or the ability to participate in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity, you agree to:
2.2.1.1.      Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the YouGov Registration Process;
2.2.1.2.      Maintain and promptly update your personal membership details including the Panel Membership Profile (defined below) so as to keep it true, accurate, current and complete; and
2.2.1.3.      Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by YouGov whilst participating in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity.
2.2.2.         If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, incomplete or inconsistent with prior answers to identical questions, or YouGov has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, YouGov has the right to suspend or terminate your current access to, use of, and/or participation in the YouGov Panel or YouGov Activities. For example, if in YouGov’s reasonable judgement your participation in YouGov Activities persistently indicates a location of residence different to the one you provided during the YouGov Registration Process, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your membership or your participation in the YouGov Panel. This is subject to your right to refuse to answer any Panels or YouGov survey or information request.
2.3.          Your Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account
2.3.1.         Once they have completed the YouGov Registration Process, Members will be provided with a profile ("Panel Membership Profile") and an account ("YouGov Account") for the YouGov Panel and those YouGov Activities for which Points (as defined below) is awarded.
2.3.2.         Only one Panel Membership Profile is permitted per Member for the YouGov Panel and only one YouGov Account is permitted per Member for the YouGov Panel for which Points are awarded. Any Member found to have multiple Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts may have their primary and any secondary Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts deleted. Points earned via secondary YouGov Accounts may not be transferred. YouGov may demand proof of identity in the event of a dispute.
2.3.3.         A unique email address must be used by each Member. (For example, this means that family members may not each have an account using a shared email address but must each have a separate account with a separate email address.)
2.3.4.         Each Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account must only be accessed by an individual Member, and may not be accessed by any other individual without the express permission and authorisation of YouGov. You agree to notify YouGov immediately you become aware of, or suspect any unauthorised use of your login information, Panel Membership Profile and/or YouGov Account, or any other breach of security.
2.3.5.         In the event of access to your YouGov Account by another individual, YouGov reserves the right to suspend your and/or that other individual’s account until a resolution has been reached. YouGov reserves the right to reclaim any Points or other incentive earned by access of the unauthorised user.
2.3.6.         Members may earn points for their YouGov Account ("Points") in the prescribed manner detailed on the YouGov WebPages, including for completing the YouGov Registration Process and for participating in the YouGov Panel and related YouGov Activities for which Points are awarded. The amount of Points that can be earned for participation in a YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activity will be notified to Members via authorised communications.
2.3.7.         Unless otherwise specifically notified, Points can only be earned through following all and any instructions regarding earning Points. A Member's failure to correctly follow any required instructions or procedures may result in no Points being earned.
2.3.8.         Points earned will be recorded in your YouGov Account, however no Points earned are ever available for redemption until the Member has (subject to paragraph 2.3.9 below) reached the specified fulfilment level advertised, together with details of the applicable reward(s) available, in the Account section of the Website.. If YouGov has suspended or terminated your YouGov Account for any of the reasons outlined in these Terms no Points that you have earned can be redeemed.
2.3.9.         YouGov reserves the right to change the range of YouGov Activities and the YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activities for which Members may be eligible for Points and to vary the frequency of invitation to such activities. YouGov also reserves the right to alter the level of Points required before such Points can be redeemed.
2.3.10.     Points may not be transferred to other YouGov Accounts nor pooled together in any manner and the sale or barter of Points is strictly prohibited. Points has no monetary value, and cannot be used for any purpose other than redeeming the designated reward.
2.3.11.     YouGov may from time to time adjust a Member's YouGov Account upwards or downwards in response to errors which Members acknowledge may arise or suspected fraud, for which we have full authority.
2.3.12.     YouGov reserves the right to terminate any YouGov Account that has been dormant for a period of 12 months or more. By ‘dormant’ we mean, where the Member has not participated in the YouGov Panel or any related YouGov Activity within the preceding 12 month period. YouGov will attempt to contact the Member, via their nominated email address, if their YouGov Account is at risk of termination through inactivity. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the YouGov Account will be terminated, and any unused Points will be forfeited.
2.4.          Survey invitations
2.4.1.         You acknowledge that:
2.4.1.1            if you register to the YouGov Panel, it is integral to your participation that we are able to send you emails and notifications inviting you to participate in surveys for research projects, whether via the Website or App or in person; and
2.4.1.2            if you wish to stop receiving such emails and notifications, you may terminate your membership in accordance with paragraph 6.1 of these Terms.
3. Prize polls
3.1.         YouGov may ask you to participate in YouGov Activities which will enter you into a prize draw or may permit you to use your Points to enter into a prize draw. Such draws will be governed by the respective terms and conditions specified and displayed for each prize draw.
4. Referral Links
4.1.         You may be able to earn extra Points by referring friends and family to the YouGov Panel, provided they join using a unique link that we provide to you for making referrals (“Referral Link”). The conditions attached to the awarding of such extra Points are explained in the Account section of the Website and App. When referring new panel Members, you agree to not pose as or claim to represent YouGov and you will not attempt to mislead or deceive prospective Members into using your Referral Link to join. You agree to make clear to any prospective Members you refer that they will be using your unique Referral Link and that you will receive Points if they join the YouGov panel via your Referral Link.

6. Terminating your membership
6.1.         If you no longer wish to be a Member please contact YouGov. YouGov will terminate your account and cease to contact you within 7 days of receiving notice from you that you wish to terminate you membership.

10.2    If a court finds part of these Terms illegal or otherwise invalid, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately.

10.3    Reliance on these Terms.  We intend to rely on these written Terms and any document expressly referred to in them in relation to the subject matter of any agreement between us.  We and you will be legally bound by these Terms.

Examples of such events and circumstances include fire, flood and other acts of God, strikes, trade disputes, lock outs, restrictions of imports or exports, riot, accident, disruption to energy supplies, civil commotion, acts of terrorism or war.
10.5    References to ‘including’ and other similar expressions.   In these Terms, words that appear after the expression ‘include’, ‘including’, ‘other’, ‘for example’, ‘such as’ or ‘in particular’ (or any similar expression) will not limit the meaning of the words appearing before such expression.

10.10  Even if we delay in enforcing a Contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
10.11  The laws that apply to these Terms and where you may bring legal proceedings. These Terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of them in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of them in either the Scottish or the English courts.

Privacy Policy
YouGov is an ethical user of personal data. Without the trust of everyone who answers our questions, we could not produce the research that helps our clients make better decisions. The security of your personal data is important to us, too.
We’ve tried to make the privacy and cookies notice that follows as easy to read as possible. If anything in here is unclear, please contact us at dataprotection@yougov.com, and we’ll be happy to clear it up.
What this notice covers
As an organisation that relies on the use of personal data, YouGov is responsible for collecting and using your data in a responsible and safe way, and that starts with clearly telling you how we collect, use and protect your personal data.  This privacy and cookies notice sets out:
What kind of personal data we may collect from you;
How and why we collect and use your personal data;
Why we may share personal data within YouGov and with other organisations; and
The rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.
YouGov is made up of a number of companies, each of which separately controls the data provided to it by our panellists and those who otherwise participate in surveys or browse our website (“user”).  If you are a user or panellist who registered in the UK, YouGov Plc (referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “YouGov”) is the controller of your personal data. This means we choose why and how that data is processed.  We are based at 50 Featherstone St, London, EC1Y 8RT, United Kingdom.
Personal data we collect
In this section we explain what personal data we may collect when you become a YouGov member, use our website and participate in surveys, as well as data that we may collect from other sources
Data that we collect from you
When you interact with our website or take part in YouGov surveys, you provide us with the data that powers our business.  While there are certain data that you must provide to use some of our services, such as account details when you join YouGov, you control how much data you share with us.  Whether you only want to complete certain surveys, or all of them – it’s your choice.
We will only retain your personal data for as long as we need to in order to fulfil the uses we describe in this notice (or until you exercise your right to erasure, which is explained in the section about your rights).
When you register with YouGov, we collect:
|
Contact details such as your name, email and postal address
Demographic data, such as your age, gender, and general economic and household information
Your account login details, which will be your email address and the password that you have chosen
Referral partner IDs, if you arrived on our website by clicking a ‘Join YouGov’ advertisement online, or a link in an email from one of our recruitment partners (we only use this to track recruitment effectiveness and to pay our partners)
Some specific data you have shared with Facebook, but only if you choose to register with YouGov using Facebook Connect and give Facebook permission to share this information with us during that process. (Each item is specified as part of that process.)
---|---
When you answer questions in surveys, or on our website or mobile apps, we collect:
|
Your opinions on social and political issues, companies and brands
Information about your behaviours, for example what shops you like to shop in, what TV shows you have recently watched, or what kind of things you own
Device and browser “metadata” (basically an audit trail of your device and browser use), including IP address, the make, model and operating system of the device you have used and browser type (this data is collected automatically when you answer questions in surveys or browse our website or mobile apps)
If you have agreed to download tracking software (you will have been specifically invited to do this, it doesn’t happen automatically), we collect:
|
Your geolocation data, showing where you have been while carrying your mobile device
Device and browser metadata
Information about websites you have visited, which applications you have downloaded onto your computer and mobile devices, and how and when you use them (we never collect any information you enter into login and password fields when browsing the internet).
If you have been invited to participate in online or in-person qualitative research, we collect:
|
Your opinions on the topics that the research is exploring
We may also record these interviews with you, but in such cases you will be given full information about the research project and the opportunity not to participate
When you browse our website or use our mobile apps, we collect:
|
Information through the use of cookies and similar technologies  (click here to go to the section about the data we collect using cookies)
When you contact us or interact with our website or social media pages, we collect:
|
Any personal data that you may you provide about yourself, including your name and contact details and the conversation history of our communications with you
Any comments you make on our website or social media pages, and whether you have chosen to ‘follow’ any other YouGov member on our website
Special categories of personal data
Some of the data that you provide us will fall within what EU data protection law describes as ‘special categories of personal data’, such as your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or information concerning your health or sexual orientation.  For example, during a survey we may ask you about your voting history or intention, or whether you regard yourself as belonging to a particular religion.  We use this information in the same way we use all the other information we collect, but the law requires that we have your explicit consent to collect and use it.
You will be explicitly asked to consent to YouGov using those categories of data if you register to the YouGov panel. Each time we ask a question that falls into one of these categories, if you haven’t consented to our use of data in that category we’ll remind you that we need it.  You will always have the option to skip these questions if you would prefer not to allow us to use that category of data, and you can always change your consent settings on your Account page. From the moment you withdraw your consent for any category we will make no further use of any data you have shared in that category when producing research or providing services to our clients, unless and until you choose to re-consent.
Personal data collected from other sources
We may also use personal data you have shared with us to derive additional information from other sources:
Public sources: for example, we may compare your postcode against public registers to determine that you live within a certain catchment area for a particular local authority or electoral constituency.
Data matching partners: we may purchase data from companies which helps us to categorise our panellists’ data into groups or ‘segments’ based on a classification of consumers devised by the data matching partner. We add the segment information we purchase to the data we hold about you (click here for more information about how we share personal data with these companies to add these segments to our own data).
You may still receive invitations to participate in our research activities if you have not joined YouGov.  In these cases we will have received your email address either from a client, or we’ll have acquired it from an organisation that maintains databases of contact details so that companies like YouGov can contact you.  We only send emails where we have guarantees from those providing the email addresses that the recipient (that’s you) has agreed to receive third-party (e.g. from YouGov) communications, and we will always tell you where we’ve got your details from and give you the option to opt-out of receiving further emails from us.
How and why we use your personal data , and who we share it with
In this section we explain how and why we use your personal data, the choices you have over how your data is used, and which other organisations we share it with
Uses of personal data for basic market research
We use the data that you share with us, or that we receive from the other sources mentioned above, to give you the best experience possible, and to provide useful research for our clients.  The uses we describe below form the basic agreement we have with our panellists.
We use personal data to…
|
For example…
---|---
Register, authenticate and administer your account
|
If you register with the YouGov panel, we will use your email address and password to create your account and authenticate your identity each time you log on, and your account details to help us to answer your questions when you contact us
Select and invite you to participate in YouGov’s research activities
|
If a client wanted to know what people who live in a certain region and demographic think about soft drinks, we will use your postcode and other demographic data to determine whether you qualify for a particular project, and then use your name and email address to invite you to participate in a survey
Credit you with the points and rewards that you earn from participating in research opportunities
|
We will use your contact details to tell you if you have won a prize draw, and your bank account details to pay you if you convert your points into money
Produce aggregated and anonymous research for our clients
|
Once we’ve gathered your survey answers, we combine them with answers from other respondents and turn them into valuable insights for our clients, either in the form of statistical spreadsheets or aggregated reports.  Some of your answers go directly into our major global brand tracking product (BrandIndex) and our segmentation and planning tool (Profiles).  Our clients access these tools to create their own aggregated insights – they don’t see anything that identifies you
Produce anonymised but non-aggregated respondent-level data for clients
|
We may provide our clients with spreadsheets that contain each of your survey answers; these data sets are not aggregated but do not reveal your identity and recipients are contractually bound to not attempt to re-identify the individuals who provided the answers
Create articles and other content for our website
|
We use survey responses to write interesting articles that may be published on our website or included in news articles on third party websites
Develop and improve our services
|
We use your survey responses to improve our research tools and methods, which helps us ensure that we are giving you and our clients the best possible experience
Respond to you when you exercise any of your rights relating to the data we hold about you (more information about the rights you have over your data is set out below)
|
We will use your account information and internal identifiers to identify the data that is relevant to your request and respond to you
Detect and prevent fraudulent activity
|
We use your IP address to ensure your location matches the location of the panel that you joined, and we sometimes repeat questions during surveys to check for inattention or other indicators of poor quality responses
In order to use your personal data in the ways described above, we may share it within YouGov, with trusted third parties who provide services to us, and on rare occasions with clients (but only if you have agreed to that specifically, within the relevant survey). Here is some more information about the types of organisation and what we may share with them:
YouGov Group companies
|
YouGov is a global organisation.  This means that some of the personal data that we collect may be transferred within the YouGov Group of companies, for example when a client wants to run a survey in multiple countries, or our global data teams analyse data from across our global panel.
---|---
Our clients
|
Our business is built on providing clients with anonymised research insights. On occasion, our clients may ask to combine your survey responses with their own data to obtain even greater insights. In such cases you will be asked in the relevant survey if you are willing to provide certain identifying data (such as your email address or a social media handle) to our clients to enable this. Whether you share this data or not is completely up to you – if you do not want to provide the requested data it will have no impact on the points you can earn or your participation in future research opportunities.
Our service providers
|
We work with trusted service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf so we can provide our services to you.
These organisations process data on our behalf. They only have access to the personal data that they absolutely need to provide the specific service to us, and in all cases we have contractual safeguards in place to ensure that they do not disclose or use it for any other purposes. In some cases, these organisations (for example our payment processors) may need to process your personal data for their own specific purposes, for example to ensure they are compliant with regulations or laws governing their own sectors.
Our service providers fall within the following categories (and process your data in the following location(s)):
Processors of cash payments, gift cards and other incentives (European Economic Area (“EEA”), USA)
Data collection technology providers (EEA, USA)
Cloud data storage (EEA, USA)
Data centre storage (EEA, USA)
Communications platforms and technologies (EEA)
Online advertising (EEA, USA)
Our data matching partners
|
Our data matching partners create and sell consumer classifications that help companies understand the demographics, lifestyles, preferences and behaviours of consumers.  This information is valuable to our clients, and if requested we will add this data to the insights we provide to them.
To do this we share certain personal data, such as your name, email address and postcode, so that our partners can match it against their own data and tell us which of their segments you belong to.  As with our other service providers, we only share the personal data that our data matching partners need to match our data to theirs, and we have contractual safeguards in place to ensure that they do not disclose or use the data for any other purposes.
Our data matching partners include:
Experian (from whom we receive Mosaic, FSS and Consumer View codes)
Acxiom (from whom we receive Personicx codes)
CACI (from whom we receive Acorn and Fresco codes)
Other organisations
|
These circumstances are unusual, but we may share personal data with other organisations if:
we have to share your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (or we reasonably believe that we need to disclose your information for such purposes);
we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, including with our legal and other professional advisors;
we restructure our business or if we buy or sell any business or assets we may share your data with the prospective buyer or seller;
all or substantially all of our company assets are acquired by another party, your data will be one of the transferred assets
If you don’t want us to make use of your personal data in any of the ways described above, sharing your data with YouGov and using our services is not for you – you should unsubscribe here, or contact us and ask us to do that for you.  We need to use your data in these basic ways to be able to give your opinions meaning in the world, and to conduct the research that allows us to exist as a business.
Uses of personal data ** for advanced research and modelling**
In addition to the uses we describe above, provided you choose to participate as a panellist in this way, we may also share your data with trusted partner organisations.  Our partners use this data to create and improve their products and services, and to create audiences for advertisers to target with more relevant communications and propositions (although you will never be included in these audiences).  Here is some more information about our partners and what we may share with them:
Our partners for advanced research and modelling
|
By matching personal details (for example your name, email address and postcode or a unique identifier) or online identifiers , our partners can use survey responses to:
Create and improve products and services, such as consumer segmentations, to help other organisations better understand the likely characteristics of their customers; and
Create audiences for advertisers to target with more relevant communications and propositions (the advertising audiences are created by finding people in the population who have similar characteristics to you, via a process called lookalike modelling, so you will never be included in these audiences).
Provided you choose to participate in this way, we may share your personal details with the following partners for these purposes:
Experian
Acxiom / LiveRamp
MediaBrands, part of IPG
Again, provided you choose to participate in this way, we may share online identifiers with the following partners for these purposes:
Eyeota
mPlatform, part of GroupM
Adform
---|---
You have complete control over whether we use your data in this way (i.e. non-anonymously).   You can choose not to participate in these uses by changing your permission setting on your Account page .
Legal grounds for processing your personal data
YouGov is committed to the lawful, fair and transparent use of personal data. For every use of your personal data we have described so far, we process your personal data on the grounds that our processing is necessary for legitimate interests we pursue as a business, namely that our business relies entirely on the ability to use your personal data to produce research and insight for our clients.
If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds apply, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the contact details in the ‘Contact Us’ section at the bottom of the page.
Transferring personal data outside the EEA
We take all steps possible to ensure that your personal data remains within the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  However, in some cases we need to share data with other YouGov group companies or third parties that are in countries outside the EEA, as described earlier.  These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent.
In these cases we put in place appropriate safeguards to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected.  Specifically, we make use of one of the following:
Standard contractual clauses : we use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to organisations outside the EEA.  These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection for personal data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to certain data protection standards including obliging them to apply appropriate technical and security measures.  We use standard contractual clauses when we transfer data to other YouGov Group companies and for transfers to recipients that are neither Privacy Shield certified nor located in a country covered by an adequacy decision (see below).
EU-US Privacy Shield: the Privacy Shield is a program agreed between the EU and US which aims to protect the personal data of anyone in the EU when it is transferred to the US by placing data protection obligations on US companies that receive personal data from the EU.  YouGov may rely on these safeguards when transferring data to companies based in the US where those companies are Privacy Shield certified.
Adequacy decisions: where the European Commission has determined that a country outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above.  YouGov may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries where such assurances have been given.
Please contact us using the details at the end of this notice for more information about the protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents.
How we store and protect your personal data
We know how important it is to protect your personal data while we have it.  This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that it is kept secure
We do everything we can to protect your personal data from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that your personal data is secure:
We use data centres that have a high level of physical security measures to host and protect your data and our systems;
We conduct independent penetration tests on an annual basis and are continuously scanning our systems and applications for vulnerabilities in our systems; if you ever think that you have found a security issue or vulnerability in one of our systems please let us know at security@yougov.com;
We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS and in storage using AES256 encryption;
We allow access to attributable data (by which we mean data that directly identifies you) only to those YouGov employees who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, for example our support team to allow them to respond to you when you contact us;
We make security the responsibility of all our employees and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.
Our website may from time to time contain links to and from other websites.  If you follow a link to any of those websites, please note that those websites ought to have their own privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those websites.  Please check those privacy notices before you submit your information to those websites.
Emails and notifications
This section explains the choices you have when it comes to emails and notifications we may send to you
If you register as a YouGov panellist, it is integral to your participation that we are able to send you emails and notifications inviting you to participate in research projects, which could be conducted online via survey, by downloading a mobile app, or in person.  By its nature most of our research is time-sensitive, and without the ability to notify you that we would like your opinion you’ll be at a disadvantage to other panellists because you’ll miss out on opportunities to share your opinion and earn points.
If you would prefer not to receive these service messages, you will need to withdraw from the panel entirely.
Separately, we may want to send you emails and notifications when your opinions feature in the news, or to encourage you to refer your friends and family to join too. You can opt out of these communications at any time on your Account page on the website.
In relation to all the emails and notifications mentioned above, we rely on our legitimate interest in running our research operation – and ensuring our panellists are adequately informed about their account with us – as the legal grounds for this processing.
