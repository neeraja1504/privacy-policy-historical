Privacy Policy | Your Auto Life
We will not share any lists of e-mail addresses or other personal information with any third party. In any such e-mail from us, we will provide a way for you to “opt out” or choose to decline to receive promotional e-mail from us. We may occasionally find a third-party offer in which we believe you might be interested and may send you information, but we will not provide your e-mail address to the third party.
We may also offer various surveys on the site. If the survey is a news survey or about service satisfaction, we will not share that information. Certain other surveys and contests are promotional in nature, and are often sponsored by or hosted and run by our advertisers.
In such cases, we disclose that we collect and may share the information you provide to enter the contest or complete the survey with the advertiser. Of course, you will always have the choice of whether to enter the contest or complete such a survey, and therefore you will control the decision about sharing your information.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect data when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site, other sites, and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

Some of the content on our site, including advertising, is provided directly from web servers owned and operated by third parties, and we do not control, and cannot be held responsible for, their use of any information they may collect.
We do not routinely disclose any of our individual reader information to third parties. We may disclose this information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of yourautolife.com or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so, or as otherwise provided in the Site’s Terms of Use.
