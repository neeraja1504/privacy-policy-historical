Privacy Policy
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Find Your IP Fast collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, your language preference, the referring site, the date and time of each request, and any Javascript errors that occur during your visit. Find Your IP Fast’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Find Your IP Fast’s visitors use its website so we can make improvements and fix bugs. From time to time, Find Your IP Fast may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Find Your IP Fast avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent necessary to provide certain services. For example, our site needs to collect an IP address from you for the sole purpose of constructing a webpage containing that IP address and delivering it back to your computer. In this instance your IP address is only stored on our server in temporary memory (RAM) for only as long as is necessary to construct the webpage and deliver it to your computer. We do not store IP addresses in permanent memory (disk), nor are they viewed by any person at Find Your IP Fast.
Aggregated Statistics
Find Your IP Fast may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Find Your IP Fast may monitor the most popular pages on findyouripfast.com sites. Find Your IP Fast may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Find Your IP Fast does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Google App Engine
Some of Find Your IP Fast's services may be provided by Google App Engine, a service operated by Google (a third party service provider).

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Find Your IP Fast’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Find Your IP Fast will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Find Your IP Fast discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Find Your IP Fast believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Find Your IP Fast, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Find Your IP Fast takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
