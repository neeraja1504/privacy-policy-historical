Collection and Use of Information
YouRepeat does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information, such as names, e-mail, age, gender, address, telephone numbers, login names and passwords or other self-identifying information ("Personal Information"). YouRepeat may request that a user provide an e-mail address if such user wishes to be contacted regarding any offers, updates, newsletters and service related announcements. If a user provides an e-mail address to YouRepeat, such user authorizes YouRepeat to send user communications.

YouRepeat will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of its users.
YouRepeat and Disclosure of Information
YouRepeat does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. YouRepeat may disclose your Personal Information if YouRepeat believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on YouRepeat; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of YouRepeat (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of YouRepeat services or members of the public.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13.

YouRepeat takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although YouRepeat cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, YouRepeat has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Business Transitions
In the event that YouRepeat goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. YouRepeat will post a notice on this website of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information YouRepeat may have prior to such transfer.
Changes to Policy
From time to time, YouRepeat may revise this Policy. YouRepeat will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information YouRepeat collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.
