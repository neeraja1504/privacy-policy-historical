Please read this privacy policy to learn more about what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
SCOPE OF POLICY
This privacy policy applies to our websites, blogs, mobile sites, and applications, including the www.myyogaworks.com website, the www.yogaworksblog.com website, the www.yogaworks.com website, and the mobile versions thereof. It does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ web sites to which we link.

INFORMATION GATHERED FROM ALL VISITORS
Aggregate Data:
We gather certain generic information with respect to all visitors’ use of our web sites, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web sites that they favor. We only use this type of data in aggregate, that is we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our web sites to make your experience easier and more enjoyable. We may also provide statistical “ratings” about how our customers collectively use our web sites to advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.
We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our sites. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

We use a technology nicknamed “cookies” on our web sites. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be set upon your browser during site visits to save your site customization preferences and to save your passwords so you do not have to re-enter passwords upon each site visit. Cookies help you navigate our web sites, and help us customize our web sites to provide personal service. We also use cookies to track user sessions and to gather site usage statistics.
IP Addresses:
We collect and analyze traffic on our web sites by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.
Applications:
We collect generic information through applications, including mobile applications or widgets.
Surveys:
From time to time, we may conduct surveys or solicit your feedback. These surveys are used to gather information to improve our sites and provide a more meaningful experience for our users. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you have expressed an interest.
