A user’s personally identifying information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and we may share the information with others if the user has not advised us of his or her preference not to be included in such an exchange. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information being used for such purposes.
Yoga Journal may send e-mail to people with whom we have a business relationship.
