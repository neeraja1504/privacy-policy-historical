COOKIES AND OTHER DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY
We use cookies and other data collection technologies to help us provide, protect and improve the Site. Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers on computers, phones and other devices and they may contain information such as user settings, browsing history and other Internet activities. While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Site, the types of cookies we use generally fall into the below categories:
Session Cookies are used to operate our Services. Some cookies are essential for the operation of the Services. If a user chooses to disable cookies, certain content and features may not be available.
Preference Cookies are used to remember your preferences. For example, when you select your location on our Site, we use cookies to remember your location preferences so you do not have to select it every time you visit the Site.
Advertising Cookies are used to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. These cookies also help us evaluate our marketing program performance and analytics.
Security Cookies are used for general security purposes, such as user authentication and preventing fraudulent use or unauthorized access of data.
We also use web beacons (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) that enable us to monitor user activity and website traffic. To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to cookies, web beacons, and other similar technology as " Data Collection Technology."
Why we use Data Collection Technology: Data Collection Technology helps us to save your password for future log-ins, detect and prevent fraud, and help us (and our ad partners) manage our online marketing program and deliver ads that are relevant or may be of interest to you. Data Collection Technology also helps us personalize and improve the performance of the Site. For example, we use Google Analytics to collect information to improve the Site, such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other website they used prior to visiting the Services. Google Analytics places a cookie on your web browser so that it can identify you the next time you visit the Site; the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
Controlling cookies on your computer: We will notify you when you are on part of the Site that uses cookies. By continuing to use that part of the Site after such notice, you accept the use of cookies. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or alert you when a cookie is dropped on your computer. Usually, these settings are available through the security features of your web browser. Please be aware that if you disable cookies, some features on the Site may not be available.
Our policy on "Do Not Track" signals: California's Online Privacy Protection Act requires website operators to disclose how they respond to web browser's "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signals. Some web browsers incorporate a DNT or similar feature that signals websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including YogaOutlet, do not respond to DNT signals.
Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising: Interest-based advertising is a way that helps companies provide you with more relevant advertising on the websites you visit. If you want to "opt out" of receiving online interest-based ads, please follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please note that when you "opt-out" of receiving interest-based ads, this does not mean you will no longer see ads from us or on the Site. It means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your particular interests. If you delete cookies on your device, generally you will need to opt-out again.
More information about online behavioral advertising can be found at www.aboutads.info.
