How long will this data be kept: | For users with a free account (including users with or without an account), a maximum of 8 days. For users with a paid account, photos are kept for as long as you're subscribed to the account. In addition, paid users get a double backup of their photos, so we can recover them in case you accidently remove photos, or require a disaster recovery. Double backups are kept for a maximum of 6 months, after which they are removed. If you have a paid account and it expires, it becomes a free account and your photos will be automatically removed 8 days later.
How to delete/modify this data: | Albums can be removed when you're logged in, by hovering over the album thumbnail and clicking the trash can icon. Photos can be removed by selecting or clicking on them, then clicking the 'delete' button. If you uploaded photos without an account, you can request removal using the Photo removal page here. Data cannot be removed from double backups before their 6 month expiration, for technical reasons. In case of a (disaster) recovery from the double backup, we have the necessary procedures in place to make sure that photos from users that were removed or requested to be removed, are not restored from the double backup.
What security measures are there to protect this personal data: | The credentials to access your photos and double backups are only available to the data protection person.
