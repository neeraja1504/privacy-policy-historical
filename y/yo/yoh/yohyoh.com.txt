You also may give us permission to access your information in other services - for example, you may link your Facebook or GMail or Yahoo account to Yohyoh, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts).

2) We get technical information when you use our Site.
These days, whenever you use a website, mobile web application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our Site, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way:
Log Data. When you use Yohyoh, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our web pages ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or mobile web app sends when you use it to access Yohyoh. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Yohyoh, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Yohyoh.
Depending on how you're accessing our site, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Yohyoh account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).
Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using for browsing Yohyoh, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
We use the information we collect to provide our application services to you and make them better, develop new services, and protect Yohyoh and our users. The collected information will not be shared with third party or other vendors. Strict confidentiality will be maintained.
We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content - including helping you discover categories or images you might like or provide you with tailored information. For example, if you've browsed through a particular set of categories, we may suggest related categorized images in your next visit.
We also use the information we collect to:
Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like newsletters or comments, happens on Yohyoh), marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include recommended images you may like.
The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Yohyoh does business, including countries outside your own.
We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Yohyoh after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.
