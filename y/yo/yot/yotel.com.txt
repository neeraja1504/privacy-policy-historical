Cookies and IP addresses
We and our appointed agencies collect anonymous information about your use of the website from cookies and using pixel tags. Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we put on your device’s hard drive and pixel tags are used to read the cookies. They allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, monitor website traffic and personalise website content just for you. This ultimately helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and allows us to improve our site going forward.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can delete existing cookies from your browser and, by editing your browser options, choose not to receive cookies in future. Our website requires first party cookies to function correctly. If you’re not happy with the use of first party cookies, you’re at liberty to leave our site. If you continue to use our site, then we deem you to have opted-in to use cookies. We also use third party data from Google:
Usage information: we collect usage information about you whenever you interact with our website and services. This includes which web pages you visit, what you click on, when you perform those actions, what language preference you have, and so on
Device and browser data: we collect information from the device and application you use to access our services. Device data mainly means your IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information, and browser type
Information from page tags: we use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags to collect data about visitors to our website. This data includes usage and user statistics
Log data: like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site, operating system versions, device type and timestamps
Referral information: if you arrive at our website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us. The site will still function correctly if you opt to exclude third party cookies, however when you make an online booking, the booking process requires cookies to work. These are temporary cookies which are automatically deleted once a transaction is made.
Our approach to marketing
The data you give us about yourself will enable us to give you updates other than through our website, using the contact details you provide, on promotions and services we think may interest you or to involve you in market research. To improve our picture of your interests we may link the data you give us with any data we have gathered (via cookies or previous booking data) about your use of the website. For example, if you start a booking, volunteer your email address and are subscribed to our email promotions, but then fail to complete the booking, then we may use this to send you an email to help you complete your booking later.
We will not send you any promotional messaging if you have indicated you do not wish to receive this information; during the booking process, the email sign up process or in your My YOTEL account. However, for every transaction you make with us (whether booking or cancelling), we will confirm via email even if you are unsubscribed.
Whenever we ask you for information about yourself you may, by ticking the relevant box, opt out of receiving marketing communications from us. In addition, whenever you are contacted by email you will be told how to opt out of being updated by email in the future. You can also amend your marketing preferences in your MY YOTEL account on our website.
Who your data may be disclosed to
We do not give or sell your data to third parties for marketing purposes. This includes email addresses and telephone numbers collected via our website, our mobile app and our Mission Control kiosks.
