This site contains links to other sites. Yottaa is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Yottaa encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Yottaa so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Yottaa is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Yottaa and Yottaa family of websites or the use of your information by such outside websites.
Use of Your Personal Information
Yottaa collects and uses your personal information to operate the Yottaa website and deliver the services you have requested. Yottaa may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Yottaa and its affiliates. Yottaa may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services.
Yottaa does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Yottaa may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Yottaa may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Yottaa, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
Yottaa keeps track of the websites and pages you visit within the Yottaa service, in order to determine what Yottaa services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content within Yottaa to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Yottaa websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Yottaa or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Yottaa (including enforcing this agreement); and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Yottaa, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The Yottaa website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Yottaa pages, or register with Yottaa site or services, a cookie helps Yottaa to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Yottaa website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Yottaa features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Yottaa services or websites you visit.
If you provide Yottaa with user information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:
1. To review the user information that you have supplied to us
2. To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us
3. To request that your user information not be used to contact you
4. To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use
5. To request that your user information be deleted from our records and
6. To opt out of being solicited by this website or third parties
If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Yottaa website.
Security of your Personal Information
No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. Yottaa uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Yottaa secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
