York Photo Labs recognizes and respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes exactly how York Photo Labs uses identifiable information regarding YorkPhoto.com customers, such as name, address, email address, and credit card number ( "Customer Information" ). Primarily, we collect such information for the purpose of providing you with an outstanding experience on the YorkPhoto.com website.
By using the YorkPhoto.com website, you consent to the collection and use of information in the manner described below. If we decide to change our privacy practice, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Please check this page from time to time for changes to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.
In this Privacy Policy, you will find the answers to the following questions:
What Customer Information does York Photo Labs collect? Back To Top
Customer Information is requested whenever you choose to use YorkPhoto.com services. The type of Customer Information we request has to do specifically with the type of service you are using. For example:
When you want to share your pictures with others ( "Invitees" ), we will ask for email addresses of friends and family you choose to share with.
When you complete an online purchase , we will ask you to provide shipping and billing information so that we can fulfill your request.
You also give information when you answer survey questions and organize your photos on the YorkPhoto.com website with titles, captions, categories, etc.
How does York Photo Labs use Customer Information? Back To Top
Our primary goal in collecting your Customer Information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, user-friendly experience on the YorkPhoto.com website. Here are the ways we use Customer Information to enhance this experience:
Customer Communication: We use Customer Information to communicate with you and we consider this communication to be an integral part of the YorkPhoto.com service. We use your email and mailing address to inform you of site improvements, feature announcements, promotional offers and occasional third-party offers that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these offers, you may always unsubscribe by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of an email, unclicking the check box on your profile page, or by writing Service@yorklabs.com.
Customer Satisfaction: We use Customer Information to make your online experience enjoyable. For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we can present you with the right set of albums in your password-protected account. We also know where to email you to let you know your photos are ready for viewing online.
Customer Convenience: We use Customer Information to provide you with the convenience of easy access to the services you request. When you choose to use the YorkPhoto.com website for digitization of your photos, or for purchasing photo merchandise, we will ask for payment information and for your email address, so we can send you a notification that your photos are available online and create an account for you on the YorkPhoto.com website. For a merchandise purchase, we will ask for final confirmation before charging your credit card. We may also collect information during the shopping experience to make purchasing an easier and better experience for you. For example, if you give us permission to keep your billing information, you won't have to fill out the shipping and billing address each and every time you make an online purchase.
York Photo Labs shares Customer Information with third party intermediaries (for example, credit card authorization companies, merchandise distributors, vendors processing our outbound email communication, etc.) who help us run the YorkPhoto.com website. Your Customer Information is provided to these third parties solely for the purpose of providing you the services you request at the time that you request them.
York Photo Labs will also share Customer Information if required by law (or to protect its rights or property).
Who sees your photos after they have been posted online? Back To Top
You, your Invitees and their Invitees can see your albums online. An Invitee is defined as anyone who is invited to the site to see an album. Â When you choose to share your online images with Invitees, those individuals will be able to view your album. However, as with any email, your Invitees could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too.
York Photo Labs employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to York Photo Labs may see your photos while they are developed, scanned or printed. In addition, your photos or personal account information may be seen by York Photo Labs employees, or employees of partner companies, in order to evaluate, validate, or correct problems with your account.
Does York Photo Labs use "IP Addresses" and cookies? Back To Top
York Photo Labs uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows:
IP Addresses: An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. We do not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
York Photo Labs Cookies: Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. For instance cookies may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping cart" or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in.
Advice on Limiting Cookies: You always have a choice with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use certain YorkPhoto.com services. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies.
Does York Photo Labs use Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)?
We use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. They also help us understand how you found the site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
HTML Newsletters
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.
What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your information from loss, misuse, or alteration? Back To Top
Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. You may edit your account information by using your member name and password.
If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign out of your YorkPhoto.com account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer. This will prevent others from accessing your account and personal information.
York Photo Labs employs SSL - a specialized encryption and security technology -- to protect your Customer Information. We understand that this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password information. In addition, we limit access of Customer Information to only those employees who need it to carry out their jobs.
York Photo Labs will never ask you for your password.
How can you update or correct Customer Information? Back To Top
Customer Information that you provide during purchase is available in your online account. To edit your Customer Information, you must enter your email address and password to access your account. You may edit your account information at any time.
You can also cancel your account by writing Service@yorklabs.com. If you request cancellation of your account, we may (but are not required to) remove any and all content (photos) or other personal information from the YorkPhoto.com website, and your photos may not be accessible to you even if you choose to rejoin or reactivate your account at a later date.
