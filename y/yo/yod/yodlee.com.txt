WHAT CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO THE YODLEE SERVICES COLLECT?
Registration Information: When you register for the Yodlee Services, you will be asked for basic registration information, such as a username and password that you choose, name, address, demographic information (such as age and income), and an e-mail address for Yodlee Customer Service. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the Yodlee Services, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the Yodlee Services. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services you requested and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you, but such information is not required to register for the Yodlee Services.
Information on Your Use of the Yodlee Services: As with most online businesses, Yodlee logs information about your access and use of the Yodlee Services web sites, including (i) your transactions conducted on the Yodlee Services web sites, including the use of Internet cookies (discussed below), (ii) the IP addresses from which you came to the site, and (iii) your communications with the Yodlee Services and web sites.
Information from Third Party Web Sites: In order to display information to you through the Yodlee Services, the Services must collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from third party web sites and Internet services that you register on the Yodlee Services. For example, if you register your credit card account through the Yodlee Services, the Service will collect the transactional and payment information regarding your credit card account to display it to you on that Yodlee Service’s web site.
Information from Yodlee Services’ Partners: Yodlee may arrange for one or more services on the Yodlee Services web sites to be provided to you in whole or in part by a third party partner. For example, Yodlee may arrange for a third party partner to provide electronic funds transfer services to you on the Yodlee Services web sites. The services of these third party partners are governed by their privacy policies, not the Yodlee Services Privacy Notice. This third party partner may share information with Yodlee on your transactions with them, for display on the Yodlee Services web sites and for purposes permissible under this Privacy Notice.
Information from Security, Fraud and Risk Service providers: Yodlee may arrange for one or more service providers to provide background information on you if you are performing financial transactions on the Yodlee Services web sites. Such providers may include federal authorities and watch list providers (e.g., OFAC) and may also include third party audit services that will protect Yodlee and you from account takeovers, phishing, and other schemes designed to fraudulently use your account.
We limit the use of your personal information we collect to the purposes for which the information was collected, or for other compatible or related purposes.

Your personal information will not be sold, shared, rented or traded with any affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, except (i) to provide you with the Yodlee Services , (ii) pursuant to joint marketing arrangements described below, or (iii) as required or permitted by law. For example, in order to provide you with the Yodlee Services, Yodlee may disclose your username and passwords to third party web sites, such as web sites operated by a credit card company or a bank, in order to obtain the information that you requested be aggregated and displayed through the Yodlee Services. When you register for the Yodlee Services, you are deemed to authorize disclosures by Yodlee to provide the Yodlee Services. Yodlee may disclose registration information and information on your use of the Yodlee Services (excluding information regarding transactions on your aggregated accounts) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with whom Yodlee offers you products and services pursuant to joint marketing agreements. For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to offer you a new service on the Yodlee Services web sites that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. Yodlee reserves the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Yodlee. If Yodlee is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Yodlee does present an opt-out option during registration for users who do not wish to share their information for joint marketing purposes as described in the prior paragraph. The user may change the opt-out choice at any time by selecting Edit Personal Profile. Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case personal information about you will never be disclosed.
WILL I BE CONTACTED IF I REGISTER FOR THE YODLEE SERVICES?
Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to send information or inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications through an opt-out option when signing up for the Yodlee Services. This choice can be changed at any time by selecting Edit Personal Profile. You may also opt-out of these communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us at customerservice@yodlee.com. However, in order to ensure the quality of the Yodlee Services, Yodlee will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. These include a “Welcome Notice” to confirm new membership, “notifications” of password changes or “account lockouts” and other “customer satisfaction” and “customer service” issues. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
DO THE YODLEE SERVICES USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
We and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the websites, track users’ movements around the websites, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.
Cookies
The Yodlee Services stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the Yodlee Services. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your Yodlee or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the Yodlee Services a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the Yodlee Services when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their Yodlee Services username (if desired) and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the Yodlee Services. We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable. Information collected by Yodlee cookies is not linked to your personal information.
We partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here [or if located in the European Union click here]. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party service provider employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.
Log Files
We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
We and our third party partners use Local Storage (HTML5) to provide certain features on our website, to display advertising based on your web browsing activities, and/or to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
HOW IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTED AND SECURED?
At Yodlee, our number one focus is customer trust. The security of your personal information is important to us. We understand the need for our customers’ personal data to be completely secure and private, and we have designed and deployed (as a part of the Yodlee Services) a state-of-the-art system to protect our customer’s’ personal information. Yodlee maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information held by Yodlee relative to the Yodlee Services. When you enter personally identifiable information on our registration page, we encrypt that information using at least 128-bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). The Yodlee Services databases are physically protected at a secure, third party site and are monitored by security personnel twenty-four hours a day. Only authorized personnel can access the data center, and they must submit to multiple forms of identification including biometric authentication. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at DataProtection@yodlee.com.
WHAT IF I NEED TO CHANGE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION I PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED?
Upon request Yodlee will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please go to the My Profile section menu option.
The Yodlee Services sites include a user profile update form for reviewing or updating personal information provided. If your personal information provided to Yodlee changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct or delete it by logging into your Yodlee Services and selecting the appropriate choice in Edit Personal Profile. If you are unable to change this information through the user profile form provided, you can use our Submit Service Request Feature to request the change or by emailing us at customerservice@yodlee.com.
