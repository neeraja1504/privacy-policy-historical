Yellowbook recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our policies and practices relating to the collection, use and storage of information provided to us by users of the Yellowbook.com website (the "Site").
What information does Yellowbook collect?
Yellowbook collects personal information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, Yellowbook may ask you to provide your contact information (such as name, address, email address, telephone number and account password) if you inquire about advertising with us, sign up for a free listing in a Yellowbook directory, register to post ratings and reviews, or otherwise contact us through the Site.
In addition, as you use the Site, our web servers automatically retrieve certain information about your browsing activity such as IP address, domain name, browser agent and user access information such as number and duration of Site visits and pages visited.
How does Yellowbook use the information collected?
When you provide personal information for a specific purpose (for example, registering to use a feature on the Site), we generally use it for that purpose.
We may use personal information you provide to: communicate with you and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name, address and email address to send you emails to (a) contact you regarding advertising services you have requested, (b) provide information about Yellowbook and our affiliates, including marketing information about products and services and newsletters, (c) conduct online surveys, (d) contact you in connection with user reviews, (e) publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have asked us not to publish this information), and (f) otherwise communicate with you.
We may retain and use emails or other communications you send to Yellowbook in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
In addition, Yellowbook may use personal information you provide in combination with the information Yellowbook automatically collects through the Site to protect our property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding copyright, use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "save and send" feature of the Site).
