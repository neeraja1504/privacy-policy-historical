This privacy policy describes the types of information We may collect from individuals (collectively, “ Users ” or “ you ”) who visit the websites and related mobile sites related to Young Entrepreneur Council (collectively, our “ Sites “), including, but not limited to, https://yec.co.  Users of our Company-operated membership communities or networks (each a “ Community ” and collectively, the “ Communities ”),  whether or not such Users are members of a Community (the “ Community Members ”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. If you have any questions about this policy, please submit an inquiry to concierge@yec.co (the “ Community Contact ”) with the subject line “Privacy Policy”.
This policy applies to information We collect from Users:
on the Sites;
via email, text, telephonic and other electronic communications between you and Company;
through mobile and desktop applications you download from the Sites, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and the Sites; and
when you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to the Sites.
It does not apply to information collected by:
us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Company or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries); or
any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Sites.
