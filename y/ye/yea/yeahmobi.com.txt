This information is for internal use only, such as optimizing performance of the Services. The information cannot identify the individual user.

2. What does Yeahmobi do with the Information?
We use the information, including any personal information, provided by users to provide the Services and for internal business purposes, such as improving our services; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; in support of user accounts or customer service requests; in relation with any required governmental or legal action; and other uses in accordance with our advertising services’ respective Terms and Conditions.
We may share your personal information with our business partners, including advertisers, data tracking companies, and with Yeahmobi affiliates so that we can better provide advertising that is relevant to you. When users are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), personal information collected from users, will be transferred to recipients in countries located outside the EEA (including US, Brazil, Singapore), which may not provide a similar or adequate level of protection to that provided by countries in the EEA. We will take reasonable measures to protect user information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Where required by law, the publisher and/or advertiser will obtain user consent to the transfer of user personal information to recipients, as described in this Privacy Policy, which are located outside the EEA. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at dataprivacy@yeahmobi.com.
3. How does Yeahmobi protect the Information?
We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the information we collect. We use multiple electronic, procedural, and physical security measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful use or alteration of information, and against any accidental loss, destruction, or damage to information.
We also have a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) according to GDPR. The DPO is responsible for monitoring our compliance with GDPR and cooperating with supervisory authority. His contact is dataprivacy@yeahmobi.com.
4. How long do we keep information for?
We may retain the information relating to a user device collected from partnering mobile publishers or app developers for as long as a user uses the Services and for the purposes as stated in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise required by law or applicable contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Yeahmobi may retain and use such information in a non-identifiable, aggregated format, as necessary for internal analytical purposes, to comply with its legal obligations, to resolve disputes and enforce agreements. Yeahmobi will make efforts to guarantee that personal information is kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed.
5. User Rights to their information
Users have certain choices available to them when it comes to their information. For residents of the EU, we collect and process information about the users who live in the EEA only on where we have legal bases under applicable EU laws.

Furthermore, they may withdraw their consent to our processing of their information at any time by contacting as dataprivacy@yeahmobi.com, but that will mean we can no longer provide the Services to the user.

8. Send “Do Not Track” Signals:
Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites a user visits indicating user does not wish to be tracked.
