Privacy Promise for Our Customers:
When you visit this web site YES BANK may collect personal information about you, either
directly (where you are asked to provide the information) or indirectly. While information is the
cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our
customers' trust. Keeping customer information secure, and using it only as our customers
would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at YES BANK. Hence, YES BANK will only use
these personal data in accordance with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement and is

individual customers:
•   We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any
information our customers share with us.
•   We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum required to
deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our
products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.
•   We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of
customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our
Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal disciplinary process.
•   We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have
previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, or authorized by the
customer, or are required by law. YES BANK disclaims any liability arising from use or
disclosure of information to any external organization.

may, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable companies. These companies are not
permitted to retain any customer information unless the customer has specifically expressed
interest in their products or services.
•   We will inform customers at least once annually, how they may remove their names from
marketing lists. At any time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such
lists.
•   Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to
conform to our policy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.
•   For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, we will exchange
information about our customers with reputable reference sources and clearinghouse
services.
•   We will not use or share - internally or externally - personally identifiable medical
information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer's
policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to the customer when the information is collected,
or to which the customer consents.
•   We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. We will inform
customers how and where to conveniently access their account information (except when
we are prohibited by law), and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly
correct.
