COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
From software publishers and their customers
Anyone may use the Yesearncash web site to create a free publisher evaluation account. At that time, the publisher will need to enter a login name and password, which will enable secure access to the account through the web-based Yesearncash Sales Manager. The publisher will also need to enter company name and address and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. This information will be used to contact the publisher concerning interest in our services. If the publisher later becomes a licensed Yesearncash user, this information will be used to administer the publisher's account and notify the publisher about updates to the Yesearncash system.
The publisher may optionally enter name, e-mail address and phone number for shipping, billing and payment contacts. This contact information is used by the Yesearncash system for the various business functions. Additionally, e-mail addresses may be entered to receive automated sales reports. This allows multiple individuals to track activity of the publisher account.
During the software delivery process, Yesearncash will collect the customer's name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number. (Company name is optional.) The customer may also indicate a preference to receive the publisher's product update information. When applicable, the purchaser's credit card number, Card Security Code and card expiration date will also be collected. This information will be used to process orders and provide order notification.
From software publishers' approved partners (payees)
Yesearncash offers a program called SplitPay that enables Yesearncash publishers to split the sales proceeds from select products with their approved partners (payees). Yesearncash will collect the following information about parties that sign up for this program: company name, address and web site URL and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. This information will be used to process SplitPay product orders and to provide order notification to the appropriate parties.
Yesearncash archives system-generated, event-driven e-mails for events such as a publisher adding a payee account to its list of payees. This information is collected for archival purposes only.
From affiliates and portals
Yesearncash offers affiliate and portal programs that enable other web sites to direct sales to an Yesearncash publisher's web stores. Yesearncash will collect the following information about parties that sign up for either of these programs: company name, address and web site URL and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. This information will be used to process the orders generated by the affiliate or portal and to provide order notification to the appropriate parties.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
