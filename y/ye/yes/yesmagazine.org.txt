Our policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.

What information do we gather about you?
The information we gather falls into two categories:
Personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, or provide your email address and
Tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.
Paid Products and Services
While our website is free, we do sell products such as subscriptions and back issues. To enable the purchase of these and other products, we collect and store billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
YES! may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our website, on the phone, or via email. Readers are primarily contacted via email, with links to online surveys, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or mail. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released.
Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology
Cookies and Other Technologies
As is standard practice on many websites, YES! uses “cookies” and other technologies for legitimate interests to recognize you to help us understand which parts of our website are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. We use Google analytics to do some of this collection. We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data. You have the option to  opt-out of Google Analytics cookies altogether  here:   https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en .
We also use Disqus as our commenting system, which can be used by your choice. Diqus may also use cookies and has a separate privacy policy: https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy.
IP Addresses
We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site. Log data is used in aggregate to analyze usage of our website.
What do we do with the information we gather about you?
Statistical Analysis
YES! may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for marketing and customer service purposes
Email Newsletters
If you choose to receive them, YES! will periodically send you email newsletters.
YES! complies fully with the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. We will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address. If you feel you have received an email from us in error, please contact yesnewsletters [at] yesmagazine.org.
Email Promotions
If you provide your email address as a customer or newsletter subscriber, YES! reserves the right to send you promotional emails about products and services offered by YES!, fundraising campaigns, and occasional events that YES! participates in. You may opt out of these emails at any time.

YES! reserves the right to send you email relating to your account status.

If you would like to stop all communications from YES! please email customercare [at] yesmagazine.org with your name, address, and, if you get the magazine, your subscriber number (found on the mailing label of your magazine), and request that we hold all contact. If you have registered for online discussions or other services, you may receive email specific to your participation in those activities.

We may send you an email inviting you to participate in user surveys. User surveys greatly help us to improve our Web site and magazine and any information we obtain in such surveys will not be shared with third parties.
Emails From You
If you send us email, you should be aware that information disclosed in email may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information via email. Please do not send credit card information via email. This is better conveyed via a secure form on our website or over the phone to our Customer Service representatives. We will use your email address to respond directly to your questions or comments.

With whom do we share the information we gathered?
YES! will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address without your permission.
If you are a print subscriber to YES! magazine and subscribed either by mail, phone or online, we may exchange or rent your name and mailing address (but not your email address) with other like-minded organizations through direct mail. If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt-out at any time—see opt-out instructions below under “Print Promotions.”
Service Providers
We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, website analytics, and for remarketing or to advertise YES! products across the internet. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for YES!, and they may not share or resell this data.

If you don't know your subscriber number (found on the address label of the magazine), you will need to include your address as well, so we can correctly identify you.
