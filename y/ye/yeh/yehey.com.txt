Yehey.com Privacy Policy
Summary
This privacy policy explains what information is collected and how it is used. Your privacy is important and the goal of this Privacy Policy is to be as simple and non-technical as possible. This version of the Privacy Policy replaces and supersedes any prior privacy policies.
Your Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
What Information is Collected and How
Collection of Personal Information
When visiting our website, the IP address used to access the site will be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement and gather broad demographic information for internal use. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Links to third party Websites
We have included links on this site for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own.
Technical information is collected when you interact with the Network
Like almost all websites or mobile applications, the Network may create and record certain information in an automated way. For example, when you use the Network, its servers may automatically record information about your interaction with its products (“Log Data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. Log Data may include the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to the Network, your Internet Protocol address, the date and time of your request, browser type and settings, and how you interacted with the Network.
The Network may also use “cookies” (a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes), or similar technologies to record Log Data. When cookies are used, the Network may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, the Network may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Network settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit the Network.
The Network may also collect information about the device you’re using when accessing the Network, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether the Network collects some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
Information is collected when you give it, or give permission to collect it
When you sign up for or use the Network’s Services, you may voluntarily share certain information. This can include information such as your your name, profile photo, comments, email address, and any other information you provide.
How Information is Used
Information collected is used to provide the Services to you and make them better, develop new Services, and protect the Network and its users.
The information collected may be “personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you). The Network uses both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above.
How Information is Shared
If you provide the Network with personal information, that information may be used to alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; request feedback; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that may interest you.
Your personal information may be used with non-personal information that was collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user. Your personal information may be made non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant the Network a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data collected (the “Analytical Data”).
Children’s Privacy
The Network is not intended for children under 13. Children’s privacy is a serious matter and parents are encouraged to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times.
Consent
By using the Network, you consent to the collection and use of this information by the Network.
Notification of Changes
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all such changes will be posted on this page.
Terms of Use
Please read the Terms of Service governing the use of the Network.
Changes to this Privacy Statement
The contents of this statement may be altered at any time, at our discretion.
