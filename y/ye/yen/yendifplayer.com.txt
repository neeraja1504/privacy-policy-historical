This Privacy Policy is relevant to our use of any personal information you provide to us during your visit to our site.
yendifplayer.com seeks to follow the industry's best practices concerning personal information handling.

Your privacy is important to us and we will not even offer aggregate information resulting from personal information processing to any part outside yendifplayer.com. We only use the recorded personal information for:
service administration purposes, e.g. sending you password reminders, registration confirmations, billing subscription services etc.;
to contact you regarding new content added on our website, e.g. new forum posts, if you have opted in for this sort of communication;
