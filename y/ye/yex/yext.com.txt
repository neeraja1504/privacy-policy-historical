2. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE USE
We and our service providers use cookies, beacons, embedded scripts and local shared objects in connection with the Sites.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit our websites. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect information about visitors’ activities while using the website.
Beacons are small graphical images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included on our Sites and in email communications and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users, their devices and behaviour, type of email applications used, screen resolution in order to check if our communications have been opened and acted upon, and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
An  embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Local Shared Objects.  Local shared objects (or Flash cookies) are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user’s computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use local shared objects. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing local shared objects. In addition, you may manage Flash cookies by clicking here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
The above technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites, services and products, tracking users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
The table below sets out the cookies we use on the Sites, their purpose, and how you may opt out of our use of these cookies.

Managing Settings
---|---|---
Required/Technical cookies | Required cookies enable you to navigate the Sites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Sites and using the Yext products and services.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Sites, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Sites and to process your online transactions and requests.
Technical cookies can be grouped into session cookies, which allow you to navigate and use the Sites, and functionality cookies, as described below.
| Because required cookies are essential to operate the Sites and the Yext products, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.
Functionality cookies | Functionality cookies allow the Sites to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide you with more personal features.  These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Yext products after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. | To learn how to opt out of functionality cookies using your browser settings click here. Note that opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using the Sites.
Targeting/Advertising cookies
| From time-to-time we engage third-parties to track and analyse usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Sites.  We sometimes use cookies delivered by third-parties to track the performance of our advertisements.  For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Sites.
We also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see above) on the Sites and from emails. Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting website navigation information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet. We may use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites or mobile applications on any of your devices. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Third-parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
| If you wish to not have this information collected and used for targeted advertising, you may opt-out by clicking here for partners that participate in the TRUSTe opt-out tool (or if located in the European Union click here). If you wish to opt out from this type of advertising for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), you can do so by clicking here.
Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.  Yext adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles when we allow third parties to collect data on the Sites for such advertising.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.
Analytics cookies | Analytics cookies collect aggregate information on the number of visitors and the pattern of visits to the Sites and other sites over time for non-advertising purposes. | To manage and opt-out of analytics cookies based on Google Analytics solution click here.
Social Media Cookies | In order to enhance your Internet experience and to make the sharing of content easier, some of the pages on our website may contain tools or applications that are linked to third-party social media service providers such as Facebook or Twitter (see the ‘Social Media Widgets’ section, below). Through these tools or applications, the social media service provider may set its own cookies on your device. | We do not control these cookies and you should check the social media service provider’s website for further details about how they use cookies and how to manage these cookies.
You can also change your cookie settings via your browser. For further information, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.

7. MISCELLANEOUS
Third-Party Websites . The Sites may contain links to third-party owned and/or operated websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Please contact these third-parties directly for information regarding their privacy practices prior to providing them with any information. Some of our solutions are integrated into our customers’ own websites, applications and communications (“ Customer Solutions “). Where this is the case, we do not interact directly with the ultimate end user of these Customer Solutions and the customer will be responsible for the operation of these Customer Solutions and any personal information collected in connection therewith. We are not responsible for the processing of personal information by these Customer Solutions save to the extent that we receive any personal information via these Customer Solutions on behalf of the customer in order to fulfill your service requests. In these cases, we will act as a data processor and this Privacy Policy will not apply to such personal information. Please contact the relevant customer directly if you have questions regarding their data collection practices or any communications you may receive from them.
Blogs and Public Features of the Sites . Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read and collected by other users of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes. Our blog is managed by a third-party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access to or control of the information posted to the blog. None of the information that you provide using these features is protected by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums or the use thereof by any third-party. You will need to contact or log into the third-party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.
Social Media Widgets . Our Sites include buttons that allow you to share content on the Sites through services provided by Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are social media networks not affiliated with Yext.  They are headquartered at the following addresses:
Facebook: 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA
Twitter: 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA
LinkedIn: 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA

Security . We take commercially reasonable steps to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us or to any other party via the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms or login credentials (such as username and password) on our platform login, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Retention. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or longer if needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. For more information on our retention periods you can contact privacy@yext.com.
Minors . Visitors under 16 years of age are not permitted to use and/or submit their personal information on any Site.
