PRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY
View our terms & conditions
We will treat all of your Personal Information as confidential.  We will only disclose this information as required by law. We will keep your Personal Information on a secure server and we will fully comply with all applicable UK Data Protection and consumer legislation, ensuring we are fully up to date and compliant with any new legislation, including the new European General Data Protection Regulation.
In order to serve you most efficiently, reputable third-party banking (including PayPal and Shopify) and distribution institutions handle our credit card transactions and order fulfilment. They receive the information needed to verify and authorise your payment card and to process your order. All such organisations are under strict obligation to keep your personal information private.
When you shop on YETI.com’s European websites we will gather Personal Information from you such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information and a password.
We may also collect, and our third party providers of content may collect, information about where you are on the internet, your browser type, the country and telephone area code where your computer is located, the pages of the website that were viewed during your visit and any search items that you entered on our website (“User Information”). We may collect this information even if you do not register with us.
The reason that we monitor our website and capture this information is to improve your shopping experience, enabling us to handle your order, process deliveries, make you aware of exciting offers and promotions and ensure that we can continue to provide a great online shopping experience to our customers.
If you have subscribed to the YETI Europe mailing list, and wish to no longer receive news on our new products and promotions, you may unsubscribe through the links in any of our emails, or by contacting us at info@yeti.com. Please note that it is not possible to unsubscribe from any transactional emails as these emails include helpful information on your order’s progress. If you receive a transactional email from us (for example order confirmation), this does not mean you are subscribed to the YETI Europe mailing list. You are only subscribed to the YETI Europe mailing list if you explicitly subscribed.
We confirm that any Personal Information that you provide to us and any User Information from which we can identify you is held in accordance with the registration we have with the Data Commissioner’s Office.
