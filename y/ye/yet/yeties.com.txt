This Privacy Policy explains how Yeties Open Directory collects, uses, and discloses the personal information you may provide while using Yeties Open Directory (the "Website") and the services provided through the Website. It is always your choice whether or not to provide personal information through the Website. Any personal information you provide will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information Automatically Collected
2. Non-Personal Information - As is typical with many other Internet sites, the Website automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding users, such as the date and time you access the Website, your IP address, the URL from which you linked to the Website, the web browser you are using, the Website pages read and images viewed, and any content you post to the Website. This non-personal information is used for Website and system administration purposes. Non-personal information may be disclosed to third-parties and permanently archived for future use.
3. Cookies - The Website uses "cookies," a technology that stores a small amount of information on a user's computer to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), offer personalized content and information for your use and otherwise facilitate your Website experience.
Some of the banner ads displayed in the Website are provided by outside companies. These ads contain cookies. While Yeties.com uses cookies in other parts of the Website, cookies received with banner ads are collected by Yeties Open Directory's advertisers and Yeties Open Directory does not have access to this information. Yeties Open Directory may engage third parties to provide cookies that collect information regarding Website use. You may choose to decline cookies generally if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website.
