Protecting your privacy
Sensis Pty Ltd (“Sensis”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to providing you with the highest levels of customer service and to protecting your privacy. We are bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”), which sets out a number of principles concerning the protection of your personal information known as the Australian Privacy Principles.
This Privacy Statement sets out the type of information we collect, how we use it and who we may share it with. It may be amended from time to time and a current version is available at this weblink.
About Sensis
Sensis is responsible for the Yellow Pages® and White Pages® directories, electronic, wireless and online products, as well as a range of advertising, media, content, location and other business services.  Sensis also operates subsidiary companies referred to as “related companies” in this statement.
What personal information do we collect?
The personal information we collect and store may include your name, birth date, current and previous addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, work-related information, occupation, preferences for using our websites, driver's license details, web log, computer, device and connection information and your Sensis user name and password, and (depending on the service) banking and credit card details. We also hold details of your services, including their status, as well as certain details about your personal interests.
Sometimes we’ll need you to provide personal information about another person (for example, if you’d like to give someone access to your Sensis services). If that happens, we’ll need you to tell that person you’ve provided their personal information to us, and that we can be contacted for more information.
How do we collect personal information?
We collect personal information in a number of ways, including:
directly from you through our websites, via phone, via application forms or when you download and use digital applications (such as Sensis apps) ;

from publicly available sources;
from organisations identified under (“When do we disclose your personal information” see below)
from our own records of when you visit us online or where we have an online presence (such as Facebook or Twitter);
when we are required by law; and
when you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network that you have visited and what you click on.
This is not an exhaustive list of information we may collect or store as it may depend on the service or product being offered. If you don’t provide us with this information, unfortunately we may not be able to provide you with the service you require.
We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also get lists and business information that include personal information from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.
