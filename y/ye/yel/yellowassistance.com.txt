YellowAssistance.com - Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Introduction
YellowAssistance.com is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. Generally speaking, you can use YellowAssistance.com without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide additional and/or optional services that you request, such as My Place, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. YellowAssistance.com respects your right to personal privacy, and we will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement. Rest assured your information will not be sold to anyone one for any purpose.
Part I: Information Collection
General Overview
For the most part, you will not need to provide any private, personally identifiable information to use YellowAssistance.com. unless you choose to register as a user. You may elect to Set Your Address so that our search can provide listings in distance order based on where you live instead of the Geo-center of a city of zip code.
In the course of normal operation, our algorithms do collect and process a large number of not personally identifiable, information such as traffic patterns, clickstream logs, IP addresses, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your visits. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. This information is used primarily to operate our service, and at times, to develop and improve our services further.
We do track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use this tracking information to determine and continuously refine the relevancy of our search results as well as to analyze which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better search tool for you.
Registration
Some of our additional and/or optional services may require registering for an account. For such services, we may ask you for some personally identifiable information in order to create an account and to provide the service. If we require personally identifiable information for such services, it will primarily be used to identify and ensure you are the account holder. It may also be used to notify you about your account, available options, and other products and services made available by Yellow Assistance, its parent company and its subsidiaries. It will not be shared with 3rd party sites or used for any other purposes other than reasons that are not specifically listed on the site.

Part II: Information Security
YellowAssistance.com takes information security very seriously. We protect user information with a number of security and technology measures in order to prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
