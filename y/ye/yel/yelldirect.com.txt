4. How we use your personal data
We use your personal data for the following purposes:
To publish your business listing on our directory and provide you with the products and services you have requested
We use your personal data to accept you as a new or returning customer, publish your business listing on our directory and provide you with the products and services you have requested in accordance with their terms (which will differ depending on the particular products and services you have requested and can be found here).
To advertise the identity, address and contact details of your business on third party search engines, social media sites and other relevant business websites on your behalf
If you have registered for this service, we share the identity, address and contact details of your business with third party search engines (such as Google), social media sites (such as Facebook) and other relevant business websites so that we can help promote your business to your target audience and drive potential customers to your own website.
To register a domain name on your behalf
If you have registered for this service, we may need to share your contact details with the registrar responsible for maintaining the relevant register of domain names in order to complete the registration of a domain name on your behalf.
To send you service communications, including in relation to changes to our contract terms
We use the contact details you have provided to us so that we can communicate with you about the products and services that we provide to your business, including to let you know about major changes to those products and services or to the terms of the contract between us or to any related information (such as changes to this Privacy Policy).
To confirm your identity and verify the information you provide
For security reasons and to safeguard the authenticity of our directory, we must confirm you are who you say you are. This means we may check the information you provide to us against other information we hold about you from the third party sources described above in What personal data we collect and why.
To process payments
We process your payment card details so that we can obtain payment for any paid-for products and services you have requested and collect any future payments or overdue amounts for those products and services.
Direct marketing (including by third parties)
If you have provided your consent or we otherwise have the right to do so, we may use your contact details to send you direct marketing and keep you informed of promotional offers by email, SMS, post or telephone relating to our products and services.
You can unsubscribe from our direct marketing at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in any of our emails or by contacting us (see How you can contact us).
Our trusted business partners would also like to use your name, email address, postal address and telephone number to inform you of similar products, services and promotional offers. We will only share your personal data with our partners where you have provided us with your consent to do so. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in any of their emails or managing your preferences via their website.
Please see Who we share your personal data with and where it is stored by them to find out exactly who our marketing partners are.
To conduct automated decision-making and profiling
We use technology which tracks your use of our website, products and services to help us build a profile of your preferences. What this means for you is that you are more likely to receive direct marketing and promotional offers that are tailored to your specific preferences, based on your previous activity. It also means that we don’t send the same offers to all of our customers, so you may not be made the same offers as another customer.
If you don’t agree with an automated decision that our technology has made in relation to you, you can let us know (see How you can contact us) and we may decide to look into it for you. You may still have the right to object to us processing your personal data for the purpose of automated decision-making or to restrict us from doing so (see Your Rights).
Please note that the legal basis for us carrying out these activities is that it is in our legitimate interests to do so, having taken into account whether your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms are overridden by this type of processing. See Legal grounds for processingfor more information.
To track your usage of our website, communications, products and services
We use cookies and similar technologies to track your activity on our website so that we can provide important features and functionality on our website, monitor its usage, and provide you with a more personalised experienced. Please see our Cookie Policy to find out more.
We also use tracking technology within our emails to capture information such as the time and date you open our emails and the type of device used to open it. We use this information to understand the effectiveness of our email communications so that we can improve them in the future and provide a more personalised overall service to you.
To process credit risk assessments
If you are a partner in a partnership, a sole trader or represent a business which is not a private or public limited company or LLP, if you have provided your consent to do so, we process your name, job title, date of birth and residential address history dating back three years to obtain your credit score. We need to do this in order to establish the best possible payment terms we are able to offer to you.
To produce aggregated underwriting risk analysis reports for commercial lenders and commercial insurers
We combine the personal data we hold about you with other customers’ personal data to produce underwriting risk analysis reports for our commercial lenders and commercial insurers. The reports we produce are based on combined, aggregated datasets and do not contain any personal data about you or about any of our other customers.
To contact you about a contract renewal for paid-for products and services
We use the telephone number you have provided to us so that we can call you to discuss the renewal of the contract between us for any paid-for products and services we provide. We will do this in the lead up to the expiry of your contract and, if we don't hear back from you to confirm whether or not you would like to renew your contract with us, up to six months after the date that your contract with us expires.
Please note that if we haven’t heard from you by the time your contract for paid-for products and services expires or if you’ve told us your business no longer requires any of our paid-for products and services after your contract expires, your business will retain a free business listing on our directory. We will remove your listing if you tell us to (see How you can contact us).
To provide and improve customer support
We use your personal data to be able to provide and improve the customer support we provide to you (for example, where you have questions about our products and services).
To conduct internal training
We may use your personal data for internal training purposes so that our staff have the knowledge and expertise they need to ensure we provide you with the best possible customer experience. For example, if you contact us by telephone, we may record the call and make notes in relation to your call for training and service improvement purposes.
To conduct market research and analytics
We may analyse your personal data (potentially in combination with personal data relating to other customers) to better understand our customer base. We may also invite certain customers to be involved in market research. If you accept our invitation, we will use your feedback to improve our products and services.
To maintain our records and improve data accuracy
Like any business, we process personal data in the course of maintaining and administering our internal records. This includes processing your personal data to ensure that the information we hold about you is kept up to date and accurate.
To respond to enquiries, complaints and disputes
We use the personal data we hold about you to help us respond to any enquiries or complaints you have made, or deal with any dispute which may arise in the course of us providing our products and services to you, in the most effective manner.
To investigate, detect and prevent fraud and comply with our legal obligations
In certain circumstances, we use your personal data only to the extent required in order to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, including for fraud detection, investigation and prevention purposes. This may require us to provide your personal data to law enforcement agencies, including Trading Standards, if they request it.
5. Legal grounds for processing
Data protection law requires us to only process your personal data if we satisfy one or more legal grounds. These are set out in data protection law and we rely on a number of different grounds for the processing we carry out. These are as follows:
Consent
In certain circumstances, we process your personal data after obtaining your consent to do so for the purposes of:
sending you marketing communications about our products and services;
sharing your name, email address, postal address and telephone number with our trusted business partners so that they may market to you about their own similar products and services;
conducting marketing research;
using your location to deliver specific messaging and to you and to facilitate the messaging functionality on our app and websites (as applicable);
obtaining your credit score so that we can establish the best possible payment terms we are able to offer to you.
Necessary for the performance of a contract and to comply with our legal obligations
It is necessary for us to process your basic contact details, payment details and information about the business you represent for the performance of the contract between us (which, depending on the products and services we have from time to time agreed to provide to your business, is governed by one or more of the terms and conditions found here). In particular, we rely on this legal ground to:
publish your business listing on our directory and provide you with the products and services you have requested, including where relevant, advertising the identity, location and contact details of your business on third party search engines, social media sites and other relevant business websites on your behalf and registering a domain name on your behalf;
communicate with you about the products and services that we provide to your business, including to let you know about major changes to those products and services or to the terms of the contract between us or to any related information (such as changes to this Privacy Policy);
confirm your identity and verify the information you provide;
process payments; and
provide and improve customer support.
If you choose not to give some or all of the aforementioned information to us, this may affect our ability to provide our products and services to you.
In certain circumstances, we also use your personal data only to the extent required in order to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, including to detect, investigate and prevent fraud.
Necessary for the purposes of our legitimate business interests or those of a third party
It is sometimes necessary to collect and use your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a business, which are to:
provide you with products and services that are as useful and beneficial to your business as possible, including by personalising our contact with you (using automated decision-making and profiling techniques) and making sure we tell you about all the offers that are relevant to your business;
better understand our customer base so that we can improve our products and services and marketing activities (which could also benefit you);
comply with our contractual obligations to third parties, for example to produce aggregated underwriting risk analysis reports for our commercial lenders and commercial insurers;
confirm whether or not you would like to renew your contract with us for any paid-for products and services;
develop and improve our website to enhance the customer experience;
train our staff so that we can provide you with a better customer service;
respond to any enquiries or complaints you have made, or deal with any dispute which may arise in the course of us providing our products and services to you; and
ensure effective operational management and internal administration of our business, document retention, compliance with regulatory guidance and exercise or defence of legal claims.
Please note that where we wish to rely on this legal ground for processing, we are required by data protection law to consider whether our legitimate interests are overridden by your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms. We may continue to process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests only if we determine that your interests, rights and freedoms are not overridden by our legitimate interests.
We have considered these matters and on balance, we consider that the benefits described above are not outweighed by your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Where we think there is a risk that one of your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms may be affected we will not process your personal data unless there is another legal ground for us to do so (either that we have obtained your consent to the processing or it is necessary for us to perform our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations).
6. Who we share your personal data with and where it is stored by them
We may provide your personal data to:
our suppliers and services providers, including other companies in our group, who perform certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data on our behalf; and
other organisations, who use your personal data for their own purposes and are “controllers” of such data in their own right. Such organisations may be located outside the EEA.
In addition, we may disclose your personal data:
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to protect the rights, property or safety of our business, our customers or others. This includes, in specific cases, exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection; and
to successors in title or replacement operators of all or part of our business.
In some cases the personal data we collect from you may, for the purposes set out above, be transferred outside the European Economic Area (“ EEA ”) and such destinations may not have laws which protect your personal data to the same extent as in the EEA. We are required by data protection law to ensure that where we or our “processors” transfer your personal data outside the EEA, it is treated securely and is protected against unauthorised access, loss or destruction, unlawful processing and any processing which is inconsistent with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
The table below sets out details of the third parties to whom we currently disclose your personal data. The table also explains how these organisations use your personal data, whether they are our "processors" or use your personal data for their own purposes once they have received it, any processing they perform outside the EEA, and the safeguards that are used to protect your personal data if this happens. This information may be updated from time to time.
Please ask us if you would like more information about the safeguards that are used to protect your personal data when it is processed outside the EEA (see How you can contact us).
