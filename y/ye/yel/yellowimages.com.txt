Non-personal information is data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any person.

time zone;

You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Website.
Aggregated data is statistical information collected from multiple users and grouped by any criteria, such as age, occupation, language, location, etc. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
If we combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information as long as it remains combined.
When do we collect non-personal information?
We may automatically collect non-personal information about you when you access the Website.
We may also generate aggregated data by analyzing personal and non-personal information provided to us and collected by us from multiple users.
How do we use cookies and other technologies?
The Website, online services, interactive applications, email messages and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags. We may also collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your computer and device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches. These technologies allow us to collect certain information by automated means each time you access this Website, or e-mails or other services provided by us on or through this Website.
Cookies are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit a particular website. We are able to read these cookies for information purposes when you revisit our Website. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular website. Pixel tags are a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on website, or when emails are opened or accessed, and are often used in combination with cookies.
We use these technologies on the server level or using reputable third party providers to:
better understand user behaviour and improve our knowledge of the use of the Website;
see which parts of the Website people have visited;
know how many people visited the Website and specific pages accessed during each visit;
monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns;
ascertain whether the Website is operating at an optimal level and monitor the effectiveness of the Website;
diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses;
facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches;
control the number of times you see a given ad;
deliver ads that relate to your interests;
measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns;
remember your personal information when you use the Website to make your experience more convenient and personal;
provide custom, personalized content and information;
help you efficiently access your information after you sign in;
track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a Website provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act;
automatically update the Yellow Images application on your system and related devices; and
enhance our web offerings to you and to provide an enjoyable and an innovative online experience.
We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information, because it represents a computer rather than a person. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by applicable law, we will treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
You can erase or disable cookies by changing the appropriate settings on your computer, however, some areas or features of this Website may not function properly if you do so.
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. In addition to standard server tools, we may use third party providers such as Google Analytics, AWS, or others to collect and analyze such information. This information includes:
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses;
search queries;
hardware settings;
browser type and language;
Internet service provider (ISP);
referring and exit pages;
operating system;
browser and device event information such as crashes and errors;
date / time stamp; and
clickstream data.
We use this information to:
understand and analyze trends;
administer the Website;
learn about user behaviour on the Website;
gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may collect device-specific information, such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number. We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your personal information we otherwise collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we use the device-based data in combination with your personal data, we will treat it as your personal information.
When you use a location-enabled service, such as a service available through your mobile phone, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us and our partners and licensees to provide and improve our location-based products and services. If we use the location-based data in combination with your personal data, we will treat it as your personal information.
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on the Website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. We may use third party providers to send our email communications using this feature. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
We may also use web beacons and similar technologies in our email communication with you. Pixel tags tell us whether mail has been opened, which allows us to determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. We may use third party providers to send our email communications using these technologies. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in our communications to you. As long as you remain a registered user, you may not opt out of receiving important notices that we may send you from time to time and which relate to communications about your purchases and changes to our terms, conditions and policies.
When we use third party providers to collect information by automated means, we take reasonable steps to ensure that privacy policies of such third party providers duly protect your personal information, however, we may not be held responsible and we hereby disclaim any and all liability for any deliberate or negligent unauthorized disclosures that may occur in the result of failure by such third parties to take proper steps to protect the information collected through them.
How do we use aggregated data?
We may use aggregated data for any purposes and at any time in our discretion, including for all purposes listed above and including our right to disclose, sell, rent or license such aggregate data to any third parties, just like any other statistical information.
Will we disclose your information?
We will not sell, rent or license your personal information to third parties and we will not disclose any personally identifiable information that we collect from you to any third parties, except:
in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy;
to comply with legal requirements such as a law, regulation, warrant, subpoena or court order;

to enforce this Privacy Policy or any other contractual arrangement (such as terms and conditions) to which we and you may be parties;
to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, spam, malware, security or technical issues; or
if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and/or defend our rights, property or personal safety and those of our users and customers etc.

As part of the products or services offered to you through our Website, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of Canada. By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of Canada or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of Canada. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to Canada. If we transfer your information outside of Canada in this way, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. In addition, if you use our services while you are outside Canada, your information may be transferred outside Canada in order to provide you with those services.
We may from time to time make certain personal information available to our strategic partners that work with us to provide products and services, or that help us market to customers. Personal information will only be shared by us to provide or improve our products, services and advertising. It will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
We share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located anywhere in the world.
It may be necessary – by law, legal process, litigation and / or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence – for us to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for the purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
We may also disclose your personal information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.
Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale, whereby the Website is sold, we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party. Likewise, if we cease business operations or enter into bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. Such third party will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of the Website may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We may from time to time, in our sole discretion, supply third parties with non-personal information or aggregated data for use in connection with this Website or otherwise.

If at any time this Website offers any chat rooms, including videochats, forum discussion boards, public commenting platforms, etc., whether or not they are hosted by us or by third parties, we may collect the information that you disclose through such platforms.

Protecting your personal information and keeping our records accurate

All of the pages of the Website use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption where personal information is collected. To make purchases from these services, make sure that your browser (web-client) is enabled to make a secure connection to the Website's server. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it is transmitted over the internet.
