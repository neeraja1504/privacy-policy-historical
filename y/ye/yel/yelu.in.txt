provide you with a better service experience with content and advertising that is more relevant to your interests and create a business information database and associated content for use as part of GBD's online business.

the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy;
it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);
we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;
to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another GBD website user, any member of the public or GBD; or
any of the assets and/or operations of GBD are being transferred to another party.
If you do not provide requested information, GBD may not be able to provide you with access to or full use of sections of the GBD website.
