Information collected via Cookies
We use a variety of technologies, including cookies, to collect information about your online/mobile activity when you visit our Site(s). Cookies are small text files that a website server stores on your computer or device. They’re typically used to remember your account login preferences, monitor website traffic, provide customer support like live chat and help us better customize our site for your individual preferences.
We may also use Flash® objects (sometimes called "Local Shared Objects") as part of our online authentication to help us recognize your computer when you come back to our site. We do not use Flash objects for any online behavioral advertising purpose.
You can disable cookies by making the appropriate selection from your browser options to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if
you choose to disable or delete cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our site.
Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) on Third Party Sites
There are three ways we use OBA on third party websites and mobile apps that are not affiliated with Darden.
Interest‐Based Advertising
The third parties we contract with may use cookies or other technologies to gather interest-based information to customize the ads you see. This information may be combined and linked with data from other sources. Neither the third parties nor Darden collects any personally information (PI) through these cookies. We may also use aggregate data to display ads or content that may interest you.
Darden has adopted the use of the AdChoices Icon (also known as the Advertising Option Icon) on our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). You can learn more about AdChoices by visiting https://www.aboutads.info/choices/ to learn more and control whether or not you receive this type of advertising from participating companies.
Device-Based Advertising
We may also use device information, particularly in mobile advertising, to help deliver our ads and measure ad campaign effectiveness. Darden and the companies we work with may collect some certain information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing this information creates a unique ID for individual devices and can be "matched" to the same information on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses.
Device Usage Research
We may participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op. This helps us understand how you use our website and apps across your devices so that we can better tailor promotions to you. Learn more about how Adobe’s program works and manage your preferences.
"Do Not Track" Signals
We do not respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals at this time. To prevent us or third parties from tracking, you can access your browser settings and disable or delete your cookies.

Our websites are not intended for children under 13.

This may include requesting that you provide us with at least two or more pieces of personal information to match against personal information about you that we may or may not maintain and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verification.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
