Data protection statement
Scope of application
This data protection statement explains to users the nature, scope and purposes of the collection and use of personal data that is performed by the provider responsible, Yamaha Music Europe GmbH, Siemensstraße 22-34, 25462 Rellingen (hereinafter referred to as "Yamaha") on this website (hereinafter referred to as the "services").
Protecting your data
Yamaha believes that you have the right to know how this website collects and treats data, and would like to tell you how you can contribute to data protection. Essentially, it is possible to use the website without giving personal data. There may be different regulations for using specific services of our site, which we will explain separately below. The legal basis of data protection can be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG).
Each visit to a Yamaha website is automatically registered, where the visitor's IP address and domain name as well as the site that is visited are registered. Yamaha requires this information to understand how visitors are using the sites by employing statistical methods. This means the services can be continuously improved.
How does Yamaha use cookies?
You may also be asked for personal data in specific areas which may make it possible to identify you personally. The concept of personal data is defined in the German Federal Data Protection Act. It relates to particular details about personal or factual circumstances of a certain or determinable individual. In this regard, you will be asked to enter certain data, such as your name, your email address, postal address etc. These data are collected if you want to participate in certain services like chatrooms or forums, if you participate in a competition or if you request products or services using these internet services.
Yamaha only collects these data for the respective purpose for which you give your personal data. To achieve this objective, Yamaha may pass on the data to its branch offices (e.g. to the respective national branch), who will process them. If the data are no longer required, we will destroy them in accordance with data protection law. If personal data are to be used beyond that, Yamaha will ask you expressly for your consent, which you can withdraw at any time by informing Yamaha. Your personal data will not be used for any other purpose than the one you have given it for without your consent. Beyond this purpose, they will also not be used to contact you and will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. Should Yamaha be legally required to do so, it will pass on personal data to authorities or courts, upon request.
Security
Yamaha endeavors to ensure a high level of security of the website. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out unauthorized access to stored data or the system and the damage arising from this.
Data transfer Your data will not be passed on to third parties, unless we are legally obliged to do so. Where external service providers come into contact with your personal data, we have ensured that these observe the provision of the data protection laws by means of legal, technical and organizational measures, in addition to regular monitoring. However, in these cases, the extent of the data being transferred is reduced to the minimum that is required. Your express consent is also required for transferring personal data to third parties, in particular if these third parties are located outside of the applicability of the law of the European Union. Consent can be withdrawn at any time with future effect.

Tag Manager makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. Tags are small code elements that, among other things, are used to measure traffic and visitor behavior, to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels, to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups, and to test and optimize websites. We only use Google Analytics (see below). If you have performed deactivation, Google Tag Manager takes this deactivation into account. For more information on Google Tag Manager see: https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html
