We may also obtain Personal Information about you from our affiliates and business partners, based on information that has already been shared with or made available to them.

2.    ** Disclosure of Personal Information.** Yamaha may disclose Personal Information that we collect via our websites or via our mobile apps with other Yamaha companies, or with third parties, such as, co-branding partners, retail outlets, fulfillment services providers, advertising networks, or app developers for all legal purposes without restriction. Without limiting the foregoing, Yamaha may also disclose Personal Information under the following circumstances:
i.    ** Do Not Track "DNT" Signals.**   While we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference.

As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this privacy policy for further updates on this topic.
Further, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites.

3.    ** Device Information.** When you are connected to our services via custom applications (apps) or wi-fi, we may collect device-specific information such as your hardware model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number.

We may also maintain digital communication logs that track information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. We may use your device's IP address or MAC address to track device-event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
4.    ** Specialized information.** We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. We may also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services such as advertising services offered by us or our business partners. Certain services may include a unique application number in connection with the installation of apps. This number and information, including, without limitation, operating system type and app version number may be sent to our service providers when you install, update or uninstall apps. We may also collect and process information about your actual location. For example, we may acquire your device's GPS signals. We may also use various technologies to determine your location based on information collected via our wi-fi access points, custom sensors, and cell towers.

These channels or links are provided for your convenience only and should be used with your discretion and prudent judgment. Links from our Website to third-party websites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Yamaha of the content, policies or practices of such third-party Websites. The collection and use of your Personal Information by such co-branding third parties is the responsibility of the co-branding partner, and not Yamaha. Yamaha is not responsible for any information these websites or digital channels may obtain and does not oversee their policies or practices in collecting Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. The privacy policies of these third-party websites may differ from those of Yamaha. These Websites may ask you for Personal Information. Please review the privacy policy on third-party channels before submitting information, because Yamaha does not have control over the use of information collected on these websites. This Website may also be linked to websites operated by companies affiliated with Yamaha. Please review the privacy policies and practices of these digital channels before providing any Personal Information.
