Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your web-browsing experience. Not all web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy our Site.
We may also use local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on our Site to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on our Site and may display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, using flash cookies to help track and store information about you.
