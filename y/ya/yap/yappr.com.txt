ABOUT YAPPR

Visitors to the Site can view your profile, and see your activities and what you have posted on the Site. You can watch videos, join in a chat and practice writing English while having fun and making new friends. By registering you can communicate with other registered users of the Site. You can post comments and messages, chat, and send yappr messages to other registered users. We request and display what you post on the Site to visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends on the Site. You can change your profile information at any time and can control how others communicate with you.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
User Provided Information. yappr collects personal information from you when you register on the Site, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of the Site. To register with yappr, you must provide a user name, password, native language, birth year, and email address. When you register you may also provide your country (which will be represented by a country flag in your profile), city, gender and how you heard about the Site. Once you are a registered user of yappr you will be given the option to add additional personal information about you to your profile. By enabling the invisible mode you can limit what information will be viewed by others. In invisible mode you will be able to send messages to other users, chat with other users, and view and post comments and messages, but other users will only be able to view your user name and country flag. They will not be able to view other information in your profile. However, while in invisible mode you cannot invite other users to join your circle of friends, and they cannot invite you to join theirs. You can enable or disable the invisible mode at any time. To do this, just click on the "My Yappr" link listed throughout the Site and then click on "My Account" to select or unselect the preference for "invisible mode". However, enabling invisible mode will not affect information that had been previously posted. Any previously posted information may still be visible to other users. Also, disabling invisible mode will make information about your previous activity on the Site, even while you were in invisible mode, available to other users. Be aware that whether you are in invisible mode or not, if you choose to make public posts, submit a comment, or chat, then any personal information you actively include in such submissions, and certain basic profile data that cannot be hidden, such as your username and your country flag, will still be accessible to all registered users and any visitors to the Site. By posting a profile or disclosing personal information in our online forums, directly to users in chat rooms or through messages, or otherwise, your information is made public and you should not expect any privacy in such an environment. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the Site, including content you view linked from the Site and yappr points that you have earned, which will also be displayed on the Site. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information, and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on the Site. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the Site.
