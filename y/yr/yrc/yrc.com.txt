The information we receive from you is voluntary. The general information you provide helps us build a better website in terms of functionality and content. With your permission, we may occasionally notify you of news at YRC Freight that may be of interest to you.
The information that we collect in the Tools section directly relates to the application or task that you have asked us to perform, such as a pickup request. As with the general information, we’ll use what you have provided to continue to build better service and business overall.
Please note that data protection laws in the United States differ from those in Canada. By providing us your personal information, you consent to the collection, transfer and processing of your personal information to and from both the United States and Canada and agree that your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts or law enforcement in the United States according to the laws of the United States.

Our website is a voluntary information channel that is open to you at all times. You always have a choice regarding the tools that you use and the information that you provide. We don’t ask questions for the sake of asking questions, but do so because it is pertinent to our ability to serve and know you better. You always have the right to access your personal information and to modify or delete it as you wish.
