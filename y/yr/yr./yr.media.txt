Personal Information and Choice
“Personal information” is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information; however, it is considered “electronically collected personal information.”
According to Government Code Section 11015.5., “electronically collected personal information” means any information that is maintained by an organization that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to an organization by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.
“Electronically collected personal information” that we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., sending an email, or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected; however, you can complete our survey or send us an email without disclosing your personal identity. If you choose to not give your name it will in no way affect your ability to use any feature of the website.
No person shall be discriminated against in participation of any Youth Radio’s programs or services because of race, color, age, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or physical disability.
If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5, and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by Federal or State law.
A Special Note About Children (Minors)
Minors (under age 18) are only eligible to participate in Youth Radio’s programs with consent from a legal guardian. If you are a minor, you can only participant in these programs only if you should seek permission from your legal guardian(s).
Youth Radio collects information from students for each of its programs. Before collecting personal information from minors, it will notify legal guardian(s) that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it. Youth Radio will seek consent from legal guardian(s) before collecting any personally identifiable information. Legal guardian(s) may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit Youth Radio from making further use of their child’s information. Youth Radio will not knowingly provide personal information about children to third parties.
The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our services and to help us understand how people are benefiting from our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering students’ statistics.
Government Code Section 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all agencies from distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information, as defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the user. Youth Radio does not sell any “electronically collected personal information.” Any distribution of “electronically collected personal information” will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.
What Happens To Information You Submit To Us?
