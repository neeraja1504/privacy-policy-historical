Our data privacy statement, sets out how we handle personal data. We are aware of the importance to users of how personal data are handled and we assure you that we observe all relevant legal requirements. We consider the protection of your privacy to be of paramount importance. For this reason, compliance with the legal requirements on data privacy is, for us, a matter of course.
Group-Oriented Data Privacy
To which extent and in which form we process and save personal data depends on the concerned group of persons. Thereby we distinguish as follows: publisher, advertiser/merchant and user.
Publishers are website operators, who use YieldKit services by implementing the YieldKit code to activate and integrate a JavaScript into their website. The management and use of the YieldKit account takes place over a web-based portal which is accessible through a browser-login.
Advertisers/merchants are advertisers who use the YieldKit technologies to connect with publishers who use YieldKit services. Upon request, the management and use of a YieldKit account can take place over a web-based portal which is accessible through a browser-login.
We define partners as both groups, advertisers/merchants and publishers.
Users are website visitors, who use YieldKit’s publisher websites.

Cookies are small files that your browser stores on your PC in a directory designated specifically for this purpose. These cookies can be used e.g. to find out whether you have already visited a website. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. Nevertheless, you can change the settings in your browser, so that no cookies can be stored or so that your explicit agreement is required before any cookies are stored. You can also delete previously set cookies at any time. Please note that disabling cookies may result in your use of our website and YieldKit services being restricted.
Used Cookies
Session-Cookies
YieldKit uses session-cookies which support the website as well as the usage of partner accounts. After the end of the session or after a certain period of inactivity, the session cookies will expire automatically.
Additional Cookies
YieldKit also uses long-term cookies which automatically expire after 13 months. The purpose of these cookies is to collect usage data of our publisher’s websites. Furthermore, this information is used to optimize the services. The stored data does not contain any personal data like names or full IP-addresses. For details see “processed data, data sources and purpose of use, user data”.
Deactivation of Cookies
You can define individual cookie settings (cookie-type, consent and deletion) in your browser settings. Furthermore, there are other opt-out options whereby an opt-out-cookie is saved. As soon as cookies are deleted you must opt-out again.
Web Analysis
Like almost all website operators, we use analytical tools in the form of tracking software to ascertain the number of users using our website and how frequently they visit.
To enable us to optimize our website and our service, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses what are known as “cookies”: these are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your website usage. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, within member states of the European Union, or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area Google first abbreviates your IP address. The full IP address will only be transmitted in exceptional circumstances to one of Google's servers in the USA, where it will then be abbreviated. Google will use this information on behalf of our website operator to analyse your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for the website operator and to perform other services connected with the use of the website and of the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged or combined with other data by Google. You can prevent cookies from being stored by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent.
You may also prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie referring to your website usage (including your IP address), and from processing these data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available from the following link tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click on this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data in this website in future (the opt-out only works in this browser, and only for this domain). This stores an opt-out cookie on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you need to click on this link again. Further information is available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de or at www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html (general information on Google Analytics and data protection).
Please note that on this website, Google Analytics has been extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();”, to ensure anonymised collection of IP addresses (known as IP masking).
