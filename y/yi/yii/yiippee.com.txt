Security & Disclosure
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of your identifiable personal information, such as firewalls,
encryption, token authentication, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our

may travel over many systems that are not under the control of yiippee. The Internet is not 100% secure and others might
intercept the information that you are sending. Remember that your account is accessible only through the use of your
Password.
Who will have access to my personal information?
Our priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. yiippee will not willfully disclose, rent, or
sell your personal information to third parties. However, certain personal information will be available to others in the
process of using yiippee. For example, visitors to yiippee may view your sign-in name, feedback rating, city, and items you
have for sale.
Of course, once you provide personal information to a user, yiippee has no control over how that information might be used
by that individual. In addition, should you circumvent our on-site messaging system; yiippee will be unable to provide
assistance in transaction disputes. We recommend using our messaging system for any communications between you and other
potential users.

assets to a third party without limitation, or (2) dispose of our assets in any manner, through bankruptcy or similar
proceeding. In addition, yiippee makes no warranties or claims regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information we
collect and disclose through our site, and disclaims any liability regarding its use.
