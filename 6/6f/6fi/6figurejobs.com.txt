Members will always have the option to opt-out of these surveys.
Who is collecting the information?
All data collection and storage is done by the in-house professional staff at 6FigureJobs. We do not outsource any of our information gathering, regarding our membership base.

Additionally, you should review the privacy policies of any of our co-branded partners before you release any information to them, if you desire.
How is your information used?
The primary function of the information gathered is to facilitate fast and efficient job searches, candidate searches and job matches among our user base.

We will disclose your personal information to any appropriate investigative third party if we believe that you are involved in any illegal or harmful conduct, if we are required to do so by law, if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or with legal process, to protect and defend our rights and property or that or our customers, to prevent fraud, to protect against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of our website or to protect the personal safety of property of our customers or the public.
We may have other companies provide services for us. These companies have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions and not for any other purposes. They are bound by confidentiality agreements not to disclose any information for any other purpose.
What are your choices regarding use of your information?

Those who choose full confidentiality will not have their information or resume posted or disseminated in any way.
Any secondary communications or requests for additional information will be "opt-in". for all registered users. Any such communications will be distributed only to members who choose to receive our newsletter, event notifications, auto email job alerts and featured special offers and can be eliminated at any time by logging into your account and reversing your original selection of "yes" to "no" for any and all of the categories.
