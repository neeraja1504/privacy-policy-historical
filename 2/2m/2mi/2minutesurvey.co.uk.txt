Cookies are small files of letters and numbers downloaded onto your computer when you access certain websites. Cookies unlock a computer’s memory allowing sites to recognise users when they return to a site. Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information but when it is read by a browser it can help a website identify you and your requirements.
PDV Ltd uses cookies as a means of limiting the number of times you may see a certain advertisement on your screen (a process called frequency capping) to ensure that you see the best range of relevant offers and adverts.
PDV Ltd also uses ‘web beacons’ as a means of tracking whether or not you open e-mails from us. This information is used to assess whether the message has been effective, both for you and us or our partners. The information is retained by us and used in deciding the most appropriate offers to be made to you in the future.
In some cases, we also track the pages visited when you click through from Fair Exchange to one of our partner sites. Note that this information is
Anonymous – no personal information is released or can be derived from it
Restricted only to our sites and the sites of our partners. We do not track pages you visit on the general internet.
Some of the partners that we advertise with require us to use cookies or action tags. These action tags provide those websites with the aggregate number of registrations to enable them to evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising. In some instances, we and another business may exchange some of your information as part of this assessment and the provision of rewards to you. The specific details should be explained in the ‘Privacy Policy’ or ‘Conditions of Use’ page of the partner sites.
Some of the partner websites that advertise with us via our games, competitions and e-mails may well use cookies within their sites.
You may decide how you wish cookies to be used. You can make and action this decision within your computer and you can easily delete cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.
Most industry-standard web browsers have an option that allows you to turn off all cookies or have your computer inform you each time that a request to place a cookie is being made. If you turn cookies off (or refuse to accept a request to place a cookie) you may not have access to some features on our websites and our partners’ websites and you may lose the functionality of locating some of our services.
