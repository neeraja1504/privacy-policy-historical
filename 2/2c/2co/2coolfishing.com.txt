Welcome to our Privacy and Copyright Information Page
Privacy Statement:
We do not collect any personal information from this site.  Statistical data, including but not limited to, number of visitors, date and time of visits, length of visits and other information is compiled by our statistics program.  This program does not compile any specific information about a user, but tracks user trends, much like tracking attendance at a ball game.  We use this information to negotiate advertising and web server rates.
Cookies are used by our message boards to flag new messages and welcome forum users back to our boards.  You may see what information is kept on your computer, in your cookie, by checking your temporary internet cookie files.  You may also elect not to accept cookies, and visit our forums with cookies turned off, although this does disable some forum functions.  We do not have any access to your cookies.
We do not harvest or sell email addresses from this site.  Unfortunately, we cannot completely stop others from doing this, but we do all we can to address this problem.   Our web server provider has a strict no spam policy and we support that by making all of our email lists, opt in and opt out.  In other words, the only time you will receive email from this site, is by asking to do so.  If you receive any email you feel is in error or if someone subscribes you to a list without your knowledge, please email Monty Weeks at monty@2coolfishing.com and we will remove your email address from our list(s) within 24 hours, and send a confirmation of that back to you.  If you email us, we will try to respond within 24 hours, if we believe a response is requested.
Our forums are public message boards, and any information on them is considered to be in the public domain.  Please consider this when making posts.  If you make a post and need to have it removed,  email monty@2coolfishing with your request.  Posters have the opportunity to provide a password with their posts to make this function available to the poster.  Please don't ask us what your password is, because we don't have any way of knowing this information.  It is kept on your hard drive, via a cookie.
Your privacy on line while visiting our web site is important to us, and if you feel we need to change, add or delete anything from our site, or policies, please email your request to us.

This entire website, and all materials on it, including graphics and text is copyrighted.  If you would like to use any of our material, please ask first.  Normally such requests are granted.  Images and graphics on this site may be used for strictly personal use without asking.  Please don't directly link to our graphics or images.  If you feel any material on this site is protected under your copyright, notify monty@2coolfishing.com and we will immediately remove it, after confirming your ownership of it.
