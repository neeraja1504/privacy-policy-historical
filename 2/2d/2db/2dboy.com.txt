Information we collect via the game World of Goo
World of Goo does not collect any information, by default. Some versions of the game optionally connect to their platform's games service to report high scores or to collect achievements. The Android version optionally connects to Google's Play Games service (https://play.google.com).  The iOS version optionally connects to Apple's Gamecenter service (https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/gamecenter/).  Steam versions optionally connect to Steam's service (https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/). If you choose to connect to these services, and if you then tap the "connect" button in the World of Goo Corporation level, World of Goo will attempt to anonymously look up which country you're in using your IP address, and store the resulting country code in your leader board information in the games service, along with the height of the tower you've build in the World of Goo Corporation level.
