Privacy Policy
22seven is committed to the privacy of your Personal Information. Your information is yours - always. We will always collect the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to provide the Service to you. Our staff and Authorised Service Providers are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations that align directly with this Privacy Policy. They are given access only to the information they require to fulfil their responsibilities.
This Privacy Policy describes and explains what Personal Information we collect, how we use it and how we protect it. "Personal Information" means any information that is recognised as such under South African Law and includes any information which identifies you (our customer) or which, when linked to other information, can personally identify you.
We only collect Personal Information that is reasonably necessary for us to provide the Service to you.
We disclose your Personal Information only to our Authorised Service Providers with whom we contract to assist us in providing the Service to you. We make use of Authorised Service Providers to automatically aggregate your Account Information, host and run our servers, send emails, manage support requests and enrich information. They process your Personal Information strictly in accordance with our instructions and for the purpose for which such Personal Information has been disclosed to them. They will always be under obligation to protect your Personal Information on terms that provide the same or equivalent protection as set out in this Privacy Policy.
In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties as may be necessary in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, cyber crime, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or our Authorised Service Providers to legal liability.
We may aggregate and analyse your 'de-identified' information (i.e. stripped of all uniquely identifiable attributes and that cannot subsequently be re-identified) with that of other customers and information received from other sources. We will do this to develop market insights, troubleshoot problems, detect and protect against error, fraud and other criminal activity, identify behaviour/usage patterns and improve our Service generally. We may publish or share the insights we develop through this process.
No. We collect and use your Personal Information only to provide the Service to you and as set out in this Policy. Your Personal Information remains exactly that - yours.
Unless you have disabled Cookies in your Internet browser, we will store Cookies on your computer/device when you visit our website. These Cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) enable us to recognise you as a returning visitor, track your usage behaviour, as well as store your user preferences and other information. We do this to remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website. Cookies also allow us to provide custom, personalised content and information, monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
22seven staff are bound by comprehensive confidentiality obligations. Our staff are given access only to information they are required to see in order for them to fulfil their responsibilities. In all cases we provide access to the minimum amount of information. Given their role, our customer support team has access to the most amount of Personal Information - to enable them to answer your support questions. In addition to Service usage information, our internal systems provide them with secure access to:
Yes. You are able to correct inaccurate Personal Information via the Service once you have successfully logged in. Alternatively, you may request us to correct inaccurate information via email at thesvens@22seven.com. We will require that you verify you are in fact the owner of such Personal Information. Once the changes are made we will notify you by email at your nominated email address. If there is any Personal Information not accessible via the Service that you wish to have access to for purposes of correcting.

We will keep your information for as long as you are an active customer of the Service. We delete your information when you terminate your use of the Service but will retain some Personal Information for so long as we are obliged to do so under South African law. Such information will always be maintained under the same security and privacy controls that are in place for other customers of the Service.
You may opt out of disclosure of your Personal Information. Should you choose to do this and should the opt out be in respect of Personal Information necessary to provide the Service, we may not be able to extend certain features to you and in such circumstances, we will notify you of this. Should you still wish to opt out after such notification you will be entitled to do so or terminate your use of the Service, which will result in the deletion of your Personal Information.

Yes. We may change our Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any lessening of your rights or our obligations regarding your Personal Information before such changes are made. We will post the new policy on the Website or Mobile Applications and if you are not happy with the new Privacy Policy you may terminate your use of the Service. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be available at https://www.22seven.com/legal/privacy. By continuing to use the Service after changes to the Privacy Policy become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
