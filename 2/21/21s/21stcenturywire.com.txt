This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit 21stcenturywire.com (the “Site”).
This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and does not apply to any embedded or integrated or linked third party “Services”, such as a plugin or other website linked to or from the Site. We are not responsible for the practices employed by these other Services, or the information or content contained thereon. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer applicable. Your browsing activity and interaction with any other website, including those that you link to or from the Site, is subject to that website’s privacy policy.

At various times, the Site will also embed other third-party Services, such as a chat widget, poll widget or survey widget. The same data collection terms apply as with the above stated.
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking about Device Information.
HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use the Device Information that we collect to engage our readers in our content both on the Site and via email. It also helps us improve our Site and offerings by understanding our audience better. Embedded or integrated third party Services also use Device Information to optimize their Services and, in the case of advertising, deliver more targeted and relevant advertising to our audience.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
