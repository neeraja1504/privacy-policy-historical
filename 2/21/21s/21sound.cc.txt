Privacy Policy:
Aqlyrics Inc. (" Aqlyrics ") operates aqlyrics.com and may operate other websites. It is Aqlyrics's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Aqlyrics collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Aqlyrics's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Aqlyrics's visitors use its website. From time to time, Aqlyrics may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Aqlyrics also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on aqlyrics.com blogs/sites. Aqlyrics only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Aqlyrics's websites choose to interact with Aqlyrics in ways that require Aqlyrics to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Aqlyrics gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at aqlyrics.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Aqlyrics are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Aqlyrics collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Aqlyrics. Aqlyrics does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Aqlyrics may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Aqlyrics may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Aqlyrics does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Aqlyrics discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Aqlyrics's behalf or to provide services available at Aqlyrics's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Aqlyrics's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Aqlyrics will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Aqlyrics discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Aqlyrics believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Aqlyrics, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Aqlyrics website and have supplied your email address, Aqlyrics may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Aqlyrics and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Aqlyrics takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Aqlyrics visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Aqlyrics's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Aqlyrics's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Business Transfers
If Aqlyrics, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Aqlyrics goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Aqlyrics may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
