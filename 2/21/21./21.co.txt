11. Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies
When you access our Services, we may place small data files called “cookies” or “pixel tags” on your device. We use these files to understand, secure, operate, and provide our Services. In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. Cookies can store information in different ways:
Session cookies. A session cookie lasts while your browser is open and is automatically deleted when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies. A persistent cookie lasts until you or your browser deletes the cookies or they expire.
We may place "first party cookies” or “third-party cookies” on our Services. A first party cookie is a cookie that we set on our Services, while a third-party cookie is set by parties other than Earn.com. A third-party cookie can recognize your computer both when it visits our Services and when it visits other websites or applications. Earn.com does not control how third-party cookies are used. You should check the third party’s website for more information about how they use cookies.
Types of Cookies Collected. We collect the following types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential because they enable you to move around our Services and use certain features on our Services. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas. Without these cookies, some Services cannot be provided.
Performance/Analytics Cookies. These cookies collect information about how you use a website.

15. Designated Countries Privacy Rights
This Section only applies to Users and Customers of the Services that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. Where we rely only on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this Section to any User or Customer that masks or otherwise obfuscates their location information so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this Section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this Section shall apply to Users and Customers in the Designated Countries.
Our Relationship to You. Earn.com is a data controller with regard to any personal information collected from Customers or Users of its Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that act as our service providers are “data processors” that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions.
Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information. We describe our lawful bases for processing in Section 6 (“How Is Collected Information Used”) and Section 7 (“Information We Share”) under headings entitled “Designated Countries.” The lawful bases on which we rely to process your personal information include: your consent to the processing; satisfaction of our legal obligations; to protect your vital interests; to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you; in the public interest; or for our legitimate interests as described in those sections.
Marketing Activities. Direct marketing includes any communications we send to you that are only based on advertising or promoting products and services. Transactional communications about your account or our Services are not considered “direct marketing” communications. We will only contact Users or Customers by electronic means (including email or SMS) based on our legitimate interest or their consent. When we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.
If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, please click an unsubscribe link in your emails, or contact us at support@earn.com. You can object to direct marketing at any time and free of charge.
Individual Rights. We provide you with the rights described below when you use our Services. Please contact us at support@earn.com if you would like to exercise your rights under applicable law. When we receive an individual rights request from you, please make sure you are ready to verify your identity.
Please be advised that there are limitations to your individual rights. We may limit your individual rights in the following ways: (i) where denial of access is required or authorized by law; (ii) when granting access would have a negative impact on other's privacy; (iii) to protect our rights and properties; and (iv) where the request is frivolous or burdensome.
1) Right to withdraw consent. If we rely on consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.
2) Right of access and rectification. If you request a copy of your personal information that we hold, we will provide you with a copy without undue delay and free of charge, except where we are permitted by law to charge a fee. We may limit your access if such access would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals. You may request to correct or update any of your personal information held by us, unless you can already do so directly via the Services.
3) Right to erasure (the “Right to be Forgotten”). You may request us to erase any of your personal information held by us that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
4) Right to restriction. You have the right to restrict our processing your personal information where one of the following applies:
a) You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. We will restrict the processing of your personal information, which may result in an interruption of some or all of the Services, during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information.
b) The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead.
c) We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims.
d) You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.
e) We will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.
5) Right to object to processing. You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal basis of consent, contract or legitimate interests. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
6) Right to data portability. If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller”, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.
7) Notification to third-parties. If we share your personal information with third parties, we will notify them of any requests for rectification, erasure or restriction of your personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.
8) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.
9) Right to Lodge a Complaint. If you believe we have infringed or violated your privacy rights, please contact us at support@earn.com so that we can work to resolve your concerns. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of alleged infringement.
Data Protection Officer. You may reach our Data Protection Officer at dpo@earn.com.
16. Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information
We may store, process and transmit personal information in locations around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Such countries or jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Some information may also be stored locally on devices you use to interact with Earn.com’s Services. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use our Services.
Designated Countries: Earn.com transfers your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards as permitted under the Data Protection Laws. Specifically, when your personal information is transferred out of the Designated Countries, we have the required contractual provisions for transferring personal information in place with the third parties to which your information is transferred. For such transfers, we rely on legal transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or we work with U.S. based third parties that are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy or would like to access, change or delete your personal information, or have a complaint, please contact us on our support page or by emailing us at support@earn.com or contacting us at Earn USA, Inc., 548 Market Street #23008, San Francisco, CA 94104.
