Our Privacy Policy
ShortURL's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. ShortURL will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent with a few special exceptions (see last paragraph). This of course includes email addresses-- we will never share or sell your email address, and the only email you will receive from ShortURL will pertain to your account along with the occasional (typically monthly at most) newsletter or announcement.
ShortURL may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say ShortURL's members consist of x percent females and y percent males.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ShortURL.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
ShortURL may disclose a users's information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal request such as a court order; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud; or to protect ShortURLs rights and properties.
