2nd Chance Privacy Policy
Google now requires that all websites that display Google ads have a privacy policy that tells readers how the information that readers submit to a website is shared.
1) 2nd Chance and Ronald Hines do not collect any information about you on this website.
2) Dr. Hines uses no cookies or any other form of tracking on the 2nd Chance website. You just read his articles to learn more about your pet's health problems.
3) If you email Dr. Hines, he does not share your email address with anyone nor does he use your email address to sell you stuff or solicit anything.
As far as the ads that Google might decide to run on Dr. Hines' webpages, he has no control over which ads they run. Google selects those ads based on the websites you frequently visit and your buying preferences. Google knows and stores quite a lot of information about you. Google gets paid by the advertisers you see to display their ads. When you click on any of those ads, a small fraction of that is sent to Dr. Hines. He hopes that any clicks you make on those ads - as well as your donations - will generate enough revenue to pay the expense of keeping this website online and
help pay the cost of the treatment of the animals he cares for.
2nd Chance is a an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization.
