This privacy policy applies to www.23andme.com owned and operated by 23andMe, Inc. Our Privacy Statement is designed to help you better understand how we collect, use, store, process, and transfer your information when operating our website, mobile apps, products, software and other services (collectively “ Service ” or “ Services ”). The following are our core privacy principles:
We collect and handle information (i) to provide, analyze and improve our Services, (ii) as we reasonably believe is permitted by laws and regulations, such as for marketing and advertising purposes, and (iii) as reasonably necessary to comply with laws and regulations, and to protect the security and safety of our company, employees, customers and others.
We will not sell, lease, or rent your individual-level information (i.e., information about a single individual’s genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics) to any third party or to a third party for research purposes without your explicit consent.
We understand and respect the sensitive nature of the information you may provide to us, including information about your genetic characteristics, disease conditions, racial and ethnic origin, etc. To that end, we strive to be transparent in our collection, use and disclosure of this information and to ask for your explicit consent to share such sensitive information with third parties. Please see below to learn more about our sharing and consent practices.
We are committed to providing a secure and safe environment for our Services.
Please review this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Service. By using our Services, you agree to all of the policies and procedures described in the foregoing documents. 23andMe, Inc. is headquartered at 899 West Evelyn Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94041 and is referred to herein as 23andMe (or “we,” “us,” “our”) and includes all of our commonly owned companies.
1. What information we collect
Information you provide directly to us
Registration Information. When you register an account with us or purchase our Services, we collect personal information, such as your name, billing and shipping address, payment information (e.g., credit card) and contact information such as your email and phone number.
Self-Reported Information. You have the option to provide us with additional information about yourself through surveys, forms, features or applications. For example, you may provide us with information about your personal traits (e.g., eye color, height), ethnicity, disease conditions (e.g. Type 2 Diabetes), other health-related information (e.g. pulse rate, cholesterol levels, visual acuity), and family history information (e.g. information similar to the foregoing about your family members). Where you are disclosing information about a family member, you should make sure that you have permission from the family member to do so.
User Content. Some of our Services allow you to create and post or upload content, such as data, text, software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials that you create or provide to us through either a public or private transmission (“ User Content ”). For example, User Content includes any post or message you place on 23andMe’s community forums.
Blogs. Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request that we remove or anonymize your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@23andme.com. Please note that whenever you post something publicly, it may sometimes be impossible to remove the information, for example, if someone has taken a screenshot of your posting. Please exercise caution before choosing to share personal information publicly on our blogs, community forums or in any other posting. Note also that you may be required to register with a third party application to post a comment. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.
Social Media Features and Widgets. Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like or Share button and Widgets, and the LinkedIn Open ID application (“Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. They may also allow third party social media services to provide us information about you, including your name, email address, and other contact information. For example, if you use LinkedIn to sign in to our career portal, LinkedIn may import personal information from your LinkedIn profile in order to populate your job application. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.
Testimonials. We may post customer testimonials either on our website or in other online or offline formats. Customer testimonials may contain personal information and it is our policy to request consent from customers in advance of using testimonials. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@23andme.com.
Referral Information and Sharing. When you refer a person to 23andMe or choose to share results information with another person, we will ask for that person’s email address. We will use the email address solely, as applicable, to make the referral or to share your results information, and we will let your contact know that you requested the communication. By participating in a referral program or by choosing to share information with another person, you confirm that the person has given you consent for 23andMe to communicate (e.g., via email) with him or her. For more information on our referral program, see here.
Address books. If you choose to use your computer’s or mobile device’s address book in connection with our Services to make referrals or to request that we communicate with another person, we may collect the names and contact information of those persons for these purposes only.
Third-party services (e.g., social media). If you use a third-party site, such as Facebook or Twitter, in connection with our Services to communicate with another person (e.g., to make or post referrals or to request that we communicate with another person), then in addition to that person’s name and contact information, we may also collect other information (e.g., your profile picture, network, gender, username, user ID, age range, language, country, friends lists or followers) depending on your privacy settings on the third-party site. We do not control third-party site’s information practices, so please review their privacy policies and your settings on those sites carefully.
Gifts. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information for purposes of ordering the Service as a gift, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. Once a gift recipient registers for his or her Services and agrees to our Privacy Statement, our Terms of Service, and if applicable, Consent Document, his or her information will be used consistent with this Privacy Statement and those agreements, and we will not share any of the gift recipient’s personal information with the user who purchased the gift.
Customer service. When you contact our Customer Care center or correspond with us about our Service, we collect information to: track and respond to your inquiry; investigate any breach of our Terms of Service, Privacy Statement or applicable laws or regulations; and analyze and improve our Services.
Information related to our genetic testing services
Saliva sample and bio-banking. To use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genome Service® testing kit, register an online account, and ship your saliva sample to our third-party laboratory. Once received, your saliva sample will be identified by its unique barcode, along with your gender and your date of birth. The barcode label identifies you to us but not to our third-party laboratory. Unless you choose to store your sample with 23andMe (called “bio-banking”), your saliva samples and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, unless the laboratory’s legal and regulatory requirements require it to maintain physical samples.
Genetic Information. Genetic Information refers to features of your DNA that distinguish you from other people (e.g. the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs at particular locations in your genome) and is generated when we analyze and process your saliva sample, or when you otherwise contribute or access your Genetic Information through our Services. Genetic Information includes the 23andMe Results information reported to you as part of our Services, and may be used for other purposes, as outlined in Section 2 below.
Information collected through tracking technology (e.g. from cookies and similar technologies)
Web Behavior Information. We and our third party partners use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons, tags, scripts and device identifiers) to help us recognize you, customize and improve your experience, provide security, analyze usage of our Services (such as to analyze your interactions with the results, reports, and other features of the Service), gather demographic information about our user base, to offer our products and services to you, to monitor the success of marketing programs, and to serve targeted advertising on our site and on other sites around the Internet. We and our third party partners do not use your sensitive information, such as Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information, for targeted advertising. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. For more information, including the types of cookies found on 23andMe, please read our Cookie Policy.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, such as your user profile ID or order number. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.
Because 23andMe relies on third party ad networks who may track you across websites over time for advertising purposes, we are not able to respond to your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser. We cannot advise on whether your selection of “Do Not Track” option will have any effect on the collection of cookie information by the third parties who collect such cookie information on our site. Please see Section 2.c.ii, below, to learn more about our third party advertising partners, and visit our Cookie Policy to learn more about tracking cookies.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Flash Cookies (Local Shared Objects) to collect and store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118
Other Types of Information.
We are always working to enhance our Services with new products, applications and features that may result in the collection of new and different types of information. We will update our privacy statement, as needed.
2. How we use and share information
23andMe will use and share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
Using information to provide, analyze and improve our Services
We use the information described above in Section 1 to operate, provide, analyze and improve our Services. These activities may include, among other things, using your information in a manner consistent with other commitments in this privacy statement, to:
1. open your account, enable purchases and process payments, communicate with you, and implement your requests (e.g., referrals);
2. host our website, run our mobile application(s), authenticate your visits, provide custom, personalized content and information, and track your usage of our Services;
3. conduct analytics to improve and enhance our Services;
4. offer new products or services to you, including through emails, promotions or contests;
5. implement online marketing campaigns and targeted advertising, including by utilizing third party ads (subject to your cookie settings and preferences), and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and targeted advertising;
6. conduct surveys or polls, and obtain testimonials;
7. process and deliver your genetic testing results;
8. perform research & development activities, which may include, for example, conducting data analysis and research in order to develop new or improve existing products and services, and performing quality control activities.
You may be able to opt-in, opt-out or otherwise adjust your preferences of having your information used for certain of these activities. Please see below to learn more.
Information you choose to share with others
23andMe gives you the ability to share information with other individuals who have 23andMe accounts through (i) our community forums, (ii) relative finding features (e.g., “DNA Relatives”), and (iii) other sharing features (such information is “User Content”). Please refer to your settings. You may be required to opt-in to some of this sharing, but some features require an opt-out. For example, we provide the ability to opt-in to our ancestry DNA Relatives Database where your information will be shared with potential relative matches. Alternatively, if you were participating in the DNA Relatives Database you may opt-out or change the visibility of your profile data by visiting your Settings. Also, please note that certain types of your User Content may be viewable by other 23andMe users and once posted, you may not be able to delete or modify such content.
You may decide to disclose your personal information to friends and/or family members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals outside of our Services, including through third-party services such as social networks and third-party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through our application programming interface (“API”). These third parties may use your personal information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement. Please make such choices carefully and review the privacy policies of all other third parties involved in the transaction. For example, if you have enabled a 23andMe sharing feature with another person who downloads a third-party app that uses our API, your information may also be obtained by that third-party app developer and, potentially, by other users of that third-party app.
In general, personal information, once shared or disclosed, can be difficult to contain or retrieve. 23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared personal information with others. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the personal information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each person within that account. It is incumbent upon all users to share personal information and account access only with people they know and trust. Users with multi-profile accounts (e.g., where family member accounts are linked) should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.
Information we share with third parties
General service providers. We share the information described above in Section 1 with our service providers, as necessary to provide their services to us. Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services. For example, we work with third-party laboratories and contractors to process and analyze your saliva sample for purposes of generating your Genetic Information.
NOTE: Our service providers act on 23andMe’s behalf. While we implement procedures and contractual terms to protect the confidentiality and security of your information, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.
For example, to learn more about our third-party laboratories, click here.
When you purchase a testing kit from 23andMe, you are instructed to send a saliva sample to our third-party laboratory with a unique barcode label. The unique barcode identifies you to us but not to the laboratory. We are also required to provide to the laboratory, your sex/gender and date of birth or age pursuant to clinical laboratory requirements such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). No other Registration Information (such as your name, address, email, phone number or other contact information) is required or provided to the laboratory. The receiving personnel at the laboratory will remove and discard your “sender information” from the packaging (e.g., name, address) before testing personnel receive the samples for processing. Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are labeled only with the unique barcode. Unless you choose to store your sample, DNA and saliva samples are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, provided that laboratory legal and regulatory requirements no longer require the actual samples to be maintained. The laboratory securely sends the resulting Genetic Information to us along with your unique barcode. Genetic Information is stored securely on our servers; the laboratory also stores your Genetic Information, but again, labeled only with the barcode.

2. **“Targeted advertising” service providers.** We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web Behavior Information on our Service to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (“ads”) to you. They use cookies and similar technologies (such as JavaScript, beacons, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Note that we do not share Registration Information, Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with these advertising partners.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may be able to opt-out of many advertising networks by visiting here and here (if you are located in Canada, click here; or if you are located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not mean that you have opted-out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
For more information about our advertising and marketing practices, please review our Cookie Policy.
3. **Aggregate information.** We may share aggregate information with third parties, which is any information that has been stripped of your Registration Information (e.g., your name and contact information) and aggregated with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual (“Aggregate Information”). This Aggregate Information is different from “individual-level” information. Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual’s genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information. For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that “30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,” without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user. We may provide such Aggregate Information in commercial arrangements with our business partners. In contrast, individual-level Genetic Information could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or all of the Genetic Information about that user. 23andMe will ask for your consent to share individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.
4. **Information we share with commonly owned entities.** We may share some or all of your information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent. We may provide additional notice and ask for your consent if we wish to share your information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement.
Information we share with third parties with your consent
23andMe conducts research and works with public, private, and government partnerships to develop research and advance genetic understanding. With your consent, 23andMe may share aggregate or individual-level Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information, and Web Behavior Information with other parties for various purposes.
23andMe Research. “23andMe Research” refers to scientific research conducted by 23andMe or by third parties in collaboration with 23andMe with the goal of advancing genetic knowledge and to create, commercialize, and apply this new knowledge to the improvement of health care. 23andMe Research may study a specific group or population and may build upon existing scientific knowledge. At times, this research is conducted with the intent to publish findings in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and may be funded by the federal government. 23andMe Research involves the use and analysis of aggregate or individual-level Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information and Web Behavior Information as specified in the Consent Document.
1. **Consent process for 23andMe Research.** Your Genetic, Self-Reported and Web Behavior Information may be used for 23andMe Research only if you have consented to this use by completing a [Consent Document](https://web.archive.org/about/consent). If you have completed a Consent Document:
* 23andMe may use individual-level Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information and Web Behavior Information internally at 23andMe for research purposes. 23andMe may use this information to publish the results of the research in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In addition, we may allow select third party research contractors to access your individual level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information onsite at 23andMe’s offices for the purpose of conducting scientific research, provided that all such research contractors will be supervised by 23andMe and subject to 23andMe’s access rules and guidelines.
* 23andMe may disclose Aggregate Information (including aggregate Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information and Web Behavior Information to third-party research partners in accordance with the terms of our research [Consent Document](https://web.archive.org/about/consent)(s). Disclosure of individual-level information to third party research partners will occur only if we have obtained additional explicit consent from you, which may be requested as part of a particular research study. These research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific and medical research and/or conduct or support the development of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions. These research partners may publish the results of their research in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
* When your Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information and/or Web Behavior Information is being used for research purposes (whether internally by 23andMe researchers, shared in aggregate or individual-level form with third parties, or used by third party researchers onsite at 23andMe), it will never be combined with your Registration Information.
2. **Withdrawing your Consent.** You may withdraw your consent to participate in 23andMe Research at any time by changing your consent status on your 23andMe Account Settings page, or by sending a request to the Human Protections Administrator at [hpa@23andMe.com](mailto:hpa@23andMe.com). 23andMe will not include your Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information or Web Behavior Information in new 23andMe Research occurring after 30 days from the receipt of your request. Any research involving your data that has already been performed or published prior to our receipt of your request will not be reversed, undone, or withdrawn.

If you withdraw your consent for 23andMe Research your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information may still be used by us and shared with our third-party service providers to provide and improve our Services (as described in Sections 2.a and 2.b, above), and shared as Aggregate Information that does not identify you as an individual (as described above in Section 2.c).
3. **What happens if you do NOT consent to 23andMe Research?** If you do not complete a Consent Document or any additional consent agreement with 23andMe, your information will not be shared or used for 23andMe Research. However, your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information may still be used by us and shared with our third-party service providers to provide and improve our Services (as described in Section 2.a and 2.b, above), and shared as Aggregate Information that does not identify you as an individual (as described in Section 2.c, above).
Disclosures required by law
Under certain circumstances your information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders, or in coordination with regulatory authorities. 23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that 23andMe may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations; (b) enforce the 23andMe Terms of Service and other policies; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 23andMe, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public.
NOTE: If you are participating in 23andMe Research, 23andMe will withhold disclosure of your personal information involved in such research in response to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders in accordance with any applicable Certificate of Confidentiality that 23andMe has obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There are limits to what the Certificate of Confidentiality covers so please visit the Certificates of Confidentiality Kiosk (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/index.htm).
