PYXISM
Thank you for visiting Pyxism.com (our "Site"). Pyxism appreciates the opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and is committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct that information.
What Information We Collect and How We Use It
Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.  Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may however, voluntarily provide the following Personally Identifiable Information:   contact information, such as email address, physical address, shipping address and billing address; financial information including credit card, debit card, bank account numbers.   In such event, we might maintain a record of your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to provide better service in the event you contact us again. We additionally share, trade, rent, license, and/or sell this information to third parties that we believe offer products, services, and/or opportunities that are consistent with your desire to be financially secure and/or independent.  Note that if you voluntarily provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, you consent to our sales, trade, rent, license, use, and storage of the information.   Additionally, we may obtain supplemental Personally Identifiable Information from third parties, such as your driver license, credit card statement, and utility bills to verify your Personally Identifiable Information. You likewise consent to these practices.  This supplemental Personally Identifiable Information will be stored in our files and may be shared and/or traded with and/or rented, licensed, and/or sold to third parties.  Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.   We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.
Marketing
We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies to improve our services and to better serve your personalized needs. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply indicate your preference once you sign in on the Site.
Sharing Your Information
We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other Pyxism-related entities and/or business partners that provide services to Pyxism. Where we engage third-party agents or contractors to perform services on our Site, we will require them to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.   From time to time, we may release or share with our corporate family Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such is reasonably necessary to investigate unlawful activities, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.   Pyxism or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired. Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies serving you and other users of our Site.
Security
Your Personally Identifiable Information is stored on our servers in the United States. We treat your Personally Identifiable Information very carefully and use our best efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your Personally Identifiable Information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, we cannot promise, and you should not expect that your Personally Identifiable Information or private communications will always remain private. Moreover, this Privacy Policy only addresses the information that we collect from you. This Private Policy does not apply to the Personally Identifiable Information that you disclose to others, such as bidders, buyers, or sellers on the Site or any other sites throughout the Internet. Since we are unable to control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties to whom you elect to disclose the information.

Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your Personally Identifiable Information once we share, trade, rent, license, and/or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. We strongly encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of all these third parties to determine how they may use your Personally Identifiable Information.    Use of Cookies On This Site A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a Web site to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes.
