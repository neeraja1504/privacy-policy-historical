Shieldapps Software (Shieldapps Software Innovations, Shieldapps) Privacy Policy
SHIELDAPPS IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU MAY PROVIDE TO US WHEN USING ANY OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ONLINE/OFFLINE SOFTWARE. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DESCRIBES HOW WE TREAT INFORMATION WE ARE EXPOSED TO WHEN YOU ARE USING OUR SOFTWARE.
Information Collection
When you install or purchase or download trial or evaluation versions, or register a ShieldApps software, we may collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc. for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage in activities on our web site or within the ShieldApps software. When we use a payment-processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. We also give users the option of receiving useful product information (such as updates, alerts and associated product offerings), via permission based emailing platform. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless ShieldApps is required to do so by law. ShieldApps may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to ShieldApps have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than ShieldApps’ Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email.
By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to ShieldApps collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein. Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin, social networks or forum is available to all permitted users of that site. ShieldApps cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties.

We may automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information when you access our online services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors navigate our sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the number and frequency of visitors, length of visits, etc.
Software Usage
We automatically collect standard usage information when you install our software (such as but not limited to your operating system installation language, installed software, browser records, stored 3rd and other information that is needed for our software to fulfill its purpose). This information helps us provide you with our technical services as they are described in the software that you have installed.

We may use information collected in the following ways:
• To process, validate and verify purchases.
• To contact you to reconfirm or verify accuracy of information provided.

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms of use (for example protect our intellectual property rights), and your compliance with the applicable End User License Agreement(s) contained within the ShieldApps software. We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the applicable law may require us to do so.
