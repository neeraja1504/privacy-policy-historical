**Information for  EU Customers: **
The European Commission has established standards for the handling of personal information by information processors.   These standards exceed current US privacy standards.  Main Sequence offers contractual terms for EU customers that are compliant with these standards.  Those are known as “Model Contract Terms”.   In addition, Main Sequence participates in the US-EU negotiated Privacy Shield program.
Main Sequence complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Main Sequence has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
Regardless of contractual or Privacy Shield status, the following privacy principles apply to the transfer, collection, use or disclosure by Main Sequence of personal information of third-parties (“Public Users”) and/or Account Owners from the EU:
Notice: Main Sequence informs Account Owners in the EU about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal information, how to contact Main Sequence, the types of third parties with which Main Sequence shares their personal information, and the choice and means Main Sequence offers for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information.
Main Sequence may not be in a position to furnish notice in certain situations. Specifically, notice is not required where the processing of EU personal information is necessary to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security or law enforcement requirements; or is necessary to protect Main Sequence’s legal interests and providing notice would interfere with those interests. Main Sequence provides copyright notices within its solutions to that Public Users may identify Main Sequence as the solution provider as a step toward contact with Account Owners. Main Sequence will make reasonable efforts to assure that Public Users can contact Account Owners when privacy concerns are presented.
the requirement for your organization to disclose personal information
Choice: Main Sequence will not process personal information about EU Account Owners for purposes other than those for which the information was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by the Account Owner unless the individual affirmatively and explicitly consents (“opt-in”) to the processing, or unless an exception applies.
Main Sequence also provides Account Owners with the opportunity to withdraw consent at any time (“opt-out”), in which case their personal information will not be further processed. The use of any opt-out provision by itself will not alter or abrogate any contractual obligations between the parties.
Main Sequence collects personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it is to be processed.
Transfers To Third Parties: Main Sequence will only transfer personal information about Account Owners or Public Users to third-parties where the third-party (a) has provided satisfactory assurances to Main Sequence that it will protect the information consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in the EU or a country considered “adequate” for privacy by the EU Commission, and therefore is required to comply with the EU data protection laws or substantially equivalent privacy laws.
Where Main Sequence has knowledge that a third-party, including successor organizations, to whom it has provided EU personal information is processing that information in a manner contrary to this statement, Main Sequence will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the processing.
Upon written request to Main Sequence Main Sequence will provide EU Account Owners with an inventory of personal information held. Main Sequence will also take reasonable steps to allow Account Owners to review their information for the purposes of correcting their information.
Main Sequence does not disclose personal-information stored in PCRecruiter accounts to third-parties.
Security: Main Sequence takes commercially reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect EU personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Main Sequence will identify Account Owners if we make a determination that we can no longer meet our obligation to provide the level of protection required by the Privacy Shield principles.
Enforcement: Main Sequence has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to this Statement. Account Owners are parties to additional agreements with Main Sequence, which govern ownership and use of Information, dispute resolution, and other terms and conditions relating to the use of Main Sequence solutions.
Adherence to these Privacy Principles may be limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security or public interest obligation.

Privacy Shield assures broad rights of individuals to access personal information processed by Main Sequence, and Main Sequence may accrue liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties who do not comply with Privacy Shield principles.   Main Sequence is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  Individuals may under certain conditions invoke binding arbitration.  In Annex I of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework , the Department of Commerce committed to facilitating the establishment of a fund into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay contributions to cover arbitral costs. The International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association (ICDR-AAA) was selected to administer these arbitrations and manage this fund.  Main Sequence has paid our portion of these arbitral costs.
Main Sequence has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU.
Main Sequence Privacy Statement for Australia:
As of March 2014, important changes have been made to the Privacy Act of 1988.
The changes include a new set of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that will regulate the handling of personal information by Australian Government agencies and businesses with revenue greater than $3 million (AUS), those trading in personal information, and all private health service providers.
In pertinent part, these changes include:
Personal information is defined as ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
•whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
•whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not’ (s 6(1)).
Common examples are an individual’s name, signature, address, telephone number, date of birth, medical records, bank account details, employment details and commentary or opinion about a person.
Sensitive information is defined as a subset of personal information including:
racial or ethnic origin
political opinions
membership of a political association
religious beliefs or affiliations
philosophical beliefs
membership of a professional or trade association
membership of a trade union
sexual orientation or practices, or
criminal record
health information about an individual
genetic information
biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification, or
biometric templates.
In limited circumstances, providing personal information to a contractor to perform services on behalf of the APP entity may be a use, rather than a disclosure.   This occurs where the entity does not release the subsequent handling of personal information from its effective control. For example, if an entity provides personal information to a cloud service provider for the limited purpose of performing the services of storing and ensuring the entity may access the personal information, this may be a ‘use’ by the entity.
Main Sequence is not responsible beyond a) the elements defined herein and b) the written agreement between Main Sequence and each customer for the customer’s compliance with the Privacy Act.   All relevant disclosures, measures, methods, and limitations of the act beyond the provision of Cloud services, in compliance with the Privacy Act, are the entire responsibility of the customer.  At all times, any Personal or Sensitive Information supplied to Main Sequence Technology remains in the effective control of the account owner.  In order to qualify for this definition of “ Use “, the following circumstances will always apply to Australian customers of Main Sequence Technology:
A binding contract between the customer and Main Sequence will require Main Sequence to only handle the personal information for the limited purposes selected solely at the discretion of the customer.
The contract requires any subcontractors to agree to the same obligations, and
The contract gives the entity effective control of how the information is handled by the provider, including the following:
The customer retains the right or power to access, change or retrieve the information*
The security measures taken by Main Sequence will be representative of similar measures taken by similar vendors of similar services at similar times.
The information can be retrieved or permanently deleted by the customer when no longer required, or at the end of the contract.In the event a customer account is intact, but suspended for non-payment or other mechanism of default, and the customer requests the ability to engage in activity related to compliance with the Privacy Act,  Main Sequence will a) make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the request or b) immediately terminate the account and return all personal information* to the account owner.  The final and complete destruction of personal account information will proceed with the general account data archive policies in effect at Main Sequence at the time of account termination.  All pertinent compliance requirements will remain binding on Main Sequence until such final destruction of account data.
