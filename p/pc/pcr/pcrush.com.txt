Information That We Collect
pcRUSH.com collects two types of information from customers which are stored in a secure database: voluntary information (such as name, e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses, phone, and credit card information) and automatic information (such as number of visits and browser used).
Voluntary Information
Voluntary information is personally identifiable information that our customers provide when registering with pcRUSH.com. It makes it possible for them to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided by pcRUSH.com. We also maintain a record of customer product interests and purchase history from our site in order to better supply products. This information is also necessary for us to process and ship orders, inquire our customers about purchases, and inform them about occasional special offers.
Automatic Information
Automatic information is non-personally identifiable information that we receive and store whenever you interact with us. As with many other Web sites, we use "cookies" which are small data files stored on your computer. The information we receive when your Web browser accesses pcRUSH.com includes the following:
IP address - to measure our site traffic, diagnose problems with our server and administer over our Web site.
Referral site - if you come to our site via a link from another Web site, the location of the referral is noted. This is used to help us know where some of our users come from.
Browser type - to help us optimize our site to match the latest technology used by our customers.
Number of visits - so we can offer special promotions to regular customers and provide a more personalized shopping experience.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. If you turn off cookies, you will not be able to make a purchase from our site. However, you will still be able to browse our site without any problem.
