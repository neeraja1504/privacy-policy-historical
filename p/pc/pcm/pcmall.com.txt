How We Use the Personal Information We Collect
We use the PII that you provide to us in order to 1) fulfill requests for products, services and/or information, 2) provide customer service, 3) offer new products or services, 4) measure and improve the effectiveness of our Site and our marketing endeavors, 5) tailor our online offerings to your preferences, 6) administer promotions or surveys, and 7) achieve other business purposes as permitted under applicable law.
When you make a purchase on our Site we collect credit card information including card number, card type, cardholder name and billing address, and expiration date, in order to bill you for purchases made through PC Mall. Please review our Credit Card Policy for additional information.
PC Mall may share PII with third parties for marketing and other business of PC Mall and our affiliates.  For example, __ PC Mall may disclose PII to consultants, professional advisors and contractors who perform services on our behalf. At times, PC Mall may seek to validate the PII we have collected via an audit by a third party designed to determine the accuracy of and/or to update the information collected. We may also combine data that we collect online with data collected offline (such as through purchases made through one of our catalogs), or with data provided by other parties.
PC Mall reserves the right to release PII concerning any visitor when that visitor is believed by PC Mall to be in violation of any published guidelines for the use of the Site, or participates (or is suspected of participating) in any illegal or potentially illegal activity. PC Mall also reserves the right to disclose PII to comply with applicable law, in response to civil subpoenas or discovery requests, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of PC Mall, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.
PC Mall may share PII collected from our visitors and customers with our affiliated or related companies, including our parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, or our __ parent company's other subsidiaries (collectively, our "affiliates").  We also may share PII with unaffiliated third parties, such as our marketing or business partners. For purposes of this Policy, "unaffiliated third parties" are third-party individuals or entities not affiliated with PC Mall or our affiliates.  If you not do wish for us to share your PII with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please refer to the paragraph below entitled "Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences." __
In the event that we sell or otherwise transfer to a third party assets related either (a) to the Site or (b) to one or more of our businesses, divisions or affiliated companies, we reserve the right to also transfer any and all information (including any PII) associated with the Site and/or any business, division or affiliated company to such third party.

Marketing Communications: Opting Out
When you provide PII to us, including when registering to receive email newsletters, catalog subscriptions or other information, or to make a purchase, PC Mall provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your PII used by PC Mall to send you advertising or promotional materials. Unless you have opted out of receiving such marketing materials, PC Mall may use your PII to forward you, via email or mail, advertisements concerning PC Mall products, services, special promotions, surveys or other opportunities from PC Mall that we think may be of interest to you. Such advertisements may also concern third party companies' products and services, including companies in industries such as hardware and software, and other providers of the types of products that are sold or featured on the Site.
PC Mall has partnered with unaffiliated third parties to offer our customers and Site visitors a variety of products and services. PC Mall may share PII (such as your physical mailing address - but not your email address) with our third-party marketing partners in order for them to offer you additional products and services that PC Mall believes may be of interest to you. Although we only work with third parties whom we believe to be reputable, our third-party marketing partners may have different privacy policies and practices than PC Mall. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our marketing partners or any other third parties.
Should you wish to change your preferences regarding the marketing information that you receive from PC Mall or its affiliates, or would prefer that we not share your PII with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please refer to the paragraph below entitled "Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and preferences." .

Web Beacons
Some PC Mall Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters may use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about website usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, often called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, that is ordinarily not visible to the site visitor. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page or image view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.

How We Protect Your Personal Information
To help ensure the security of your PII, PC Mall seeks to use security technology and procedures, which are reviewed periodically. We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") in all areas where your personal and account information is required. This means that the PII you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, discouraging others from accessing your private information during transmission. If your browser does not support SSL, or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at (800) 555-MALL to place your order by phone.
In addition, your personal, account information, and transaction history are kept behind our firewall.

Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences
If you would like to opt-out of having your PII shared with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, or to make changes to your PII or to your preferences regarding the marketing information that you receive from PC Mall or our affiliates, please click here. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Please note that we may need to contact you in order to be sure that we are updating the appropriate information. When requesting that PII be updated or that your preferences be changed, please keep in mind that until the change is implemented, you may still receive email and/or physical mailings from us. Furthermore, there will be residual information that will remain within PC Mall databases, access logs and other records, which may contain such PII. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, PC Mall reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or visitors to the Site.

Sweepstakes and Promotions
We may from time to time offer sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotions on the Site. Additional PII may be required in order to participate in such promotions, so that we may, for example, verify entrants' eligibility and identity and notify winners. Participation in such promotions is completely voluntary. If and when we sponsor such promotions, we will post relevant privacy information in the respective "official rules" and/or registration areas for such promotions. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes, contest or promotion -- please remember to read it carefully.
Other companies may offer sweepstakes, contests or similar promotions through our Site, including through the Rebates & Coupons page. PC Mall is not responsible for any such promotions offered by third parties. Please read all related terms and conditions carefully, or contact the applicable third party for more information. The collection and use of PII in connection with such promotions is governed by such third party's privacy policy, and not by the policies of PC Mall.

Co-branded Sites: Links to Other Sites
The Site offers certain features that are provided and/or hosted by third parties, but that may be presented on pages displaying PC Mall's branding. For example, PC Mall-branded pages featuring investor relations information about PC Mall may be created and operated by a third party data provider specializing in such information. The Site may also contain links to other Web sites, or other affiliated sites (e.g., event sponsors, or companies offering rebates or other promotions through our Rebates & Coupons page). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such Web sites, including such sites' use of any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of any third party sites.
