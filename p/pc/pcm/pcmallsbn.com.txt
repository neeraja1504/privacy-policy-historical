The purpose of this privacy policy (the "Policy") is to help you understand what kinds of personally identifiable information we may gather about you when you visit the PC Mall Web site located at www.pcmall.com and related sub-domains (the "Site"), how we may use that information, how we may disclose it, and how you can correct or update it.

Contacting PC Mall
PC Mall collects personally identifiable information that you specifically and voluntarily provide on the Site or by email to PC Mall. Personally identifiable information ("PII") is information that identifies you as a specific individual, for example, your name, account number, physical or email address, and phone number plus other information that personally identifies you including your purchase history. The Site includes both public areas, open to all visitors, and private areas that are open only to those visitors who choose to register. In addition, visitors can sign up on the Site to request email newsletters and other information from PC Mall. PC Mall collects PII from you when you:
Make a purchase
Create an account
Subscribe to our newsletter
Request a catalog via email or our website
Participate in a survey
Register at our website
We use the PII that you provide to us in order to
fulfill requests for products, services and/or information,
provide customer service,
offer new products or services,
measure and improve the effectiveness of our Site and our marketing endeavors,
tailor our online offerings to your preferences,
administer promotions or surveys, and
achieve other business purposes as permitted under applicable law.
When you make a purchase on our Site we collect credit card information including card number, card type, cardholder name and billing address, and expiration date, in order to bill you for purchases made through PC Mall. Please review our Credit Card Policy for additional information.
We also may use your PII to send you, via email or mail, advertisements concerning PC Mall products, services, special promotions, surveys or other opportunities from PC Mall that we think may be of interest to you. Such advertisements may also concern third party companies’ products and services, including companies in industries such as hardware and software, and other providers of the types of products that are sold or featured on the Site. When you provide PII to us, including when registering to receive email newsletters, catalog subscriptions or other information, or to make a purchase, PC Mall provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your PII used by PC Mall to send you these advertising or promotional materials. You also may submit this type of opt-out request at any other time, as explained below in “Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences.”
PC Mall may share PII with third parties for marketing and other business of PC Mall and our affiliates.  For example, PC Mall may disclose PII to consultants, professional advisors and contractors who perform services on our behalf.  At times, PC Mall may seek to validate the PII we have collected via an audit by a third party designed to determine the accuracy of and/or to update the information collected.  We may also combine data that we collect online with data collected offline (such as through purchases made through one of our catalogs), or with data provided by other parties.
PC Mall reserves the right to release PII concerning any visitor when that visitor is believed by PC Mall to be in violation of any published guidelines for the use of the Site, or participates (or is suspected of participating) in any illegal or potentially illegal activity.  PC Mall also reserves the right to disclose PII to comply with applicable law, in response to civil subpoenas or discovery requests, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of PC Mall, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.
PC Mall may share PII collected from our visitors and customers with our affiliated or related companies, including our parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, or our parent company’s other subsidiaries (collectively, our “affiliates”).  We also may share PII with unaffiliated third parties, such as our marketing or business partners.  For purposes of this Policy, “unaffiliated third parties” are third-party individuals or entities not affiliated with PC Mall or our affiliates.  Although we only work with third parties whom we believe to be reputable, these unaffiliated third parties may have different privacy policies and practices than PC Mall.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our marketing partners or any other third parties.  If you not do wish for us to share your PII with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please refer to the paragraph below entitled “Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences.”
In the event that we sell or otherwise transfer to a third party assets related either (a) to the Site or (b) to one or more of our businesses, divisions or affiliated companies, we reserve the right to also transfer any and all information (including any PII) associated with the Site and/or any business, division or affiliated company to such third party.
We may provide functionality on the Site that allows you to create a “profile page” (your “Profile”) and post certain information and materials on your Profile.  Please note that your Profile, including all PII available in your Profile, may be accessible to other users.  We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII about you, or any other information, in your Profile.
We may make available through the Site services (for example, message boards, forums, chat functionality and blogs, among other services) to which you are able to post information and materials.  Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public.  In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII (for example, a link to your Profile that contains PII), will be available for other users to view.  We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII, or any other information, on the Site.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE.
Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their PII to PC Mall may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Such requests may be directed to Mailing Management Department, 1940 E. Mariposa Ave, El Segundo, CA 90245.  Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of our customers’ PII that have been disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of those third parties.  This type of request may be made no more than once per calendar year.  We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the mailing address specified in this paragraph.
Upon visiting our Site we will assign you a unique ID in the form of a “cookie.” A cookie is a piece of information that our server places on your computer’s hard drive, which PC Mall may associate with your PII when you log on to the site. Cookies are used for such purposes as facilitating and personalizing your shopping and ordering experience, keeping track of your shopping basket during your visit, helping diagnose problems with our server, and administering our Site. We may use the information collected through cookies for marketing purposes to inform you of special offers, better understand your needs or answer your questions. For more information about cookies, please see our Cookie FAQs. NOTE: You can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser, and you may remove them from your computer at any time at your discretion.
Some PC Mall Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters may use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about website usage.  A Web beacon is an electronic image, often called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF that is ordinarily not visible to the site visitor.  Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor’s computer, such as a visitor’s cookie number, time and date of a page or image view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.  When used in an e-mail, they can tell us whether an e-mail has been opened.
To help protect the security of your PII, PC Mall seeks to use security technology and procedures, which are reviewed periodically.  We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) in all areas where your personal and account information is required.  This means that the PII you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, discouraging others from accessing your private information during transmission.  If your browser does not support SSL or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at (800) 555-MALL to place your order by phone.
In addition, your personal, account information, and transaction history are kept behind our firewall.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, although we strive to protect PII about you, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site or that is stored by us.
If you would like to opt-out of having your PII shared with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes, or to make changes to your PII or to your preferences regarding the marketing information that you receive from PC Mall or our affiliates, please click here .  We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.  Please note that we may need to contact you in order to be sure that we are updating the appropriate information.  When requesting that PII be updated or that your preferences be changed, please keep in mind that until the change is implemented, you may still receive email and/or physical mailings from us.  Furthermore, there will be residual information that will remain within PC Mall databases, access logs and other records, which may contain such PII.  The residual information will not be used for marketing purposes; however, PC Mall reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or visitors to the Site.  Please note that we are not responsible for retracting your PII from third parties with whom we have shared your information pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Policy as in effect from time to time.
Information About Your Computer and Your Site Activities: When a visitor comes to our Site we collect and aggregate information about the visitor’s computer (such as its IP address, operating system and browser software), and click-stream information (such as the address (or “URL”) of the Web site that the visitor came from before visiting our Site, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were clicked) for the purpose of assessing our Site traffic and the effectiveness of our Site content, as well as to help diagnose problems with our servers.  This data allows us to improve the quality of your visit by streamlining your ability to navigate the Site and to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our customers and Site visitors.
Aggregated Information: PC Mall may collect and aggregate demographic information about our Site visitors.  For example, we may seek to aggregate information regarding the gender make-up, average age and range of income levels of Site visitors in order to better service our user community.  We may use such information in its aggregated form without restriction.
Information About Corporate and Other Organizational Customers: We may collect information pertaining solely to corporations, governmental or educational entities, or other business or not for profit entities, such as, for example, a company’s address.  We may use any such corporate information without restriction.  In an effort to better support our customers by delivering more relevant marketing communications, PC Mall will, on occasion, purchase third party information about businesses and other entities that are our customers.  The company information we purchase may include number of employees, or annual sales volume and company structure.  This is used to customize such customers’ online/offline experience and to supplement our internal sales information to better serve you.
PC Mall may use outside advertising companies (“Advertisers”) to serve advertisements on the Site.  Please be advised that such Advertisers may use cookies or other technologies to enable such Advertisers to record which ads your browser has seen, and which Site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered.
We may from time to time offer sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotions on the Site. Additional PII may be required in order to participate in such promotions, so that we may, for example, verify entrants’ eligibility and identity and notify winners. Participation in such promotions is completely voluntary. If and when we sponsor such promotions, we will post relevant privacy information in the respective “official rules” and/or registration areas for such promotions. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes, contest or promotion -- please remember to read it carefully.
Other companies may offer sweepstakes, contests or similar promotions through our Site, including through the Rebates & Coupons page. PC Mall is not responsible for any such promotions offered by third parties. Please read all related terms and conditions carefully, or contact the applicable third party for more information. The collection and use of PII in connection with such promotions is governed by such third party’s privacy policy, and not by the policies of PC Mall.
The Site offers certain features that are provided and/or hosted by third parties, but that may be presented on pages displaying PC Mall’s branding.  For example, PC Mall -branded pages featuring investor relations information about PC Mall may be created and operated by a third party data provider specializing in such information.  The Site may also contain links to other Web sites, or other affiliated sites (e.g., event sponsors, or companies offering rebates or other promotions through our Rebates & Coupons page).  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such Web sites, including such sites’ use of any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites.  Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of any third party sites.
Please note that this Policy applies solely to our online information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline other than as expressly set forth in this Policy.
Should you have any questions, please e-mail us at webmaster@pcmall.com.
