At PV Latter-Day, your right to privacy is one of our primary concerns. This Privacy Policy describes the guidelines PV Latter-Day uses to protect the information we collect about you during your visit to our Web site.
Information we collect
At various times, PV Latter-Day requests personal information. This can be done while you are visiting the site, or during a purchase via our Web site, phone, or fax. Information we collect may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and personal interests. In addition, PV Latter-Day periodically sponsors contests and other promotions that may require additional information in order to participate.
What we do with this information
The requests for information allow PV Latter-Day to provide services you have requested or to enhance your experience while visiting us. The information that we collect during a purchase is necessary for us to fulfill your order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer service possible.
PV Latter-Day will not sell your private information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. Periodically, we will use the information provided to us to notify you of important announcements regarding special offers or important functionality changes to our Web site.
PV Latter-Day may also use customer information to create statistics to better understand our users and to improve our services. These statistics may also be disclosed to potential advertisers and/or business partners. (For example, we might use the aggregate statistic "15% of PV Latter-Day's users are from Texas", but we would not give away that "Mr. John Doe, age 35, is from Dallas, Texas", unless we had prior permission.)
