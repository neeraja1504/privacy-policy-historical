Entities collecting personal information
Personal information on this Site is collected by PC Doc Pro
Collection of personal information
As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as subscribing to periodic mailings offered on the Site or registering software, PC Doc Pro may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you select to engage in these activities, however, PC Doc Pro may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
When you use the Site, PC Doc Pro may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. PC Doc Pro also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site and to refine the Site to provide the best possible user experience. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.
When you submit personal information to PC Doc Pro through this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which PC Doc Pro and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors (e.g. credit card merchant services) of PC Doc Pro. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with development and support for localized and internationalized versions of our Site.
How your personal information is used
PC Doc Pro collects your registration information in order to record and support your use of the software you have registered. If you register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of PC Doc Pro and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
PC Doc Pro may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. PC Doc Pro may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
Your choices with respect to personal information
PC Doc Pro recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Site. Without your consent, PC Doc Pro will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from PC Doc Pro, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of PC Doc Pro products that you have registered. PC Doc Pro will not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
PC Doc Pro may provide your personal information if necessary, in PC Doc Pro good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights of PC Doc Pro or others.
Protection of your personal information
The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as PC Doc Pro Affiliate is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique e-mail address selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected PC Doc Pro personnel and contractors have access to via password. PC Doc Pro encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to PC Doc Pro
Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected PC Doc Pro personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.
Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room is available to all persons accessing that location. Although we may provide links to user groups and chat rooms that discuss PC Doc Pro products as a convenience to our customers, we do not control the content or privacy policies of those forums. Your e-mail address will not automatically be posted on the forums unless you permit that. Your e-mail address would then be available to all persons accessing the forums. In addition, you should be aware that the Forums offers a service in which subscribers are e-mailed a copy of all messages posted to the forums on a particular topic. Consequently, if you post a message to the forums, your e-mail address will be sent to those subscribers that have indicated an interest in the topic of your message.
