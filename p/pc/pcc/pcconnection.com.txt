To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help safeguard the information we collect. Connection may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection and other physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to such. Connection may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.
