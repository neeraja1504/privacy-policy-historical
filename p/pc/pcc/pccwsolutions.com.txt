This Privacy Policy Statement specifically addresses the Company's obligations in respect of

As such, the Company undertakes to apply, where practicable, those principles and the
processes set out herein to its operations globally.
Where the Company's operations are subject to privacy legislation other than that of Hong
Kong SAR, then this Privacy Policy Statement shall be applied so far as practicable and
consistent with such local legislation. For further details on the Company's compliance with
the Ordinance and any other privacy legislations, please contact Privacy Compliance Officer at
the address listed below.
Throughout this Privacy Policy Statement, the meaning of the term “personal data” is as
defined in the Ordinance.
COMPANY CORPORATE POLICY
The Company shall fully comply with the obligations and requirements of the Ordinance. The
Company's officers, management, and members of staff shall, at all times, respect the
confidentiality of and endeavour to keep safe any and all personal data collected and/or
stored and/or transmitted and/or used for, or on behalf of, the Company.
The Company shall endeavour to ensure all collection, storage, transmission and other
handling or usage of personal data by the Company shall be done in accordance with the
obligations and requirements of the Ordinance.
Where an individual legitimately requests access to and/or correction of personal data relating
to the individual, held by the Company, then the Company may provide and/or correct that
data in accordance with the time and manner stipulated within the Ordinance.
