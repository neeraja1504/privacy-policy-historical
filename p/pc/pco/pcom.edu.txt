Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer unless you block or limit them. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our organization.
Cookies may be set by an organization other than PCOM. These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or other social media services for which we have implemented "plug-ins." Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly. You may disable or limit cookies through your individual browser options, although this may reduce some site functionality.
Some sections of our website use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., or other similar third party tools. We also use Google Ads and other advertising services. These services use cookies to help us analyze how users use our website. This information will be transmitted to and stored by the third party on its servers. The third party will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of this website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to Internet usage. The third party may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on the third party vendor's behalf. By using our website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google and other third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
You may opt out of Google Analytics tracking use of cookies by utilizing the Google Analytics Opt-out browser add-on. You may opt out of other interest-based advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out site. Updates to your browser may affect the functionality of the opt-out add-on; check your specific browser for details.
Remarketing
We use Google and other advertising remarketing services which will advertise us or our website across other websites that you visit. Google and other third-party vendors will show our ads on websites that you visit after visiting our website, and our ads will be shown on other websites because you visited our website in the past. You can opt out of this remarketing campaign through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out site.
Links to third-party websites
We may provide hyperlinks to other websites as a convenience. As per the Terms of Use, we do not control third-party websites and are not responsible for the content of any linked-to third-party websites or any hyperlink in a linked-to website. Moreover, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party websites.
Web beacons and other technologies
We may use standard internet technology, such as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) and other similar technologies, to track your use of our website. The website and related communications may contain small electronic files known as web beacons that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may include web beacons in our email messages or other communications to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we may obtain in this manner would enable us to customize our websites and to measure the overall effectiveness of our websites, content, programming, or other activities.
Information protection
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information we gather about you, we have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect such information once obtained by us. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100 percent secure. It is possible for collected information to be disclosed without our permission or knowledge (for example, if an internet host is “attacked”, or is compromised by a virus). For this reason, PCOM disclaims any warranty or representation of privacy or non-disclosure of information collected through the use of our website.
Children and privacy
We do not operate websites or online services directed to children. We do not solicit or knowingly collect any information from visitors under 13 years of age. Do not use this website if you are not yet 13.

We may update or amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will post the revised policy on this page. The date this policy was last revised is identified in the policy heading. You are responsible for periodically reviewing this policy to check for any changes.
