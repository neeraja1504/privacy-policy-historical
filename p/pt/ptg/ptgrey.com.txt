Privacy Policy | FLIR Systems
This Privacy Policy covers how FLIR Systems, Inc., its subsidiaries, and affiliates, including companies recently acquired by FLIR Systems, Inc., such as DVTEL, Armasight and Prox Dynamics (collectively “FLIR”) treat Personal Information (as defined below) that FLIR collects and receives through your use of FLIR websites (collectively the “FLIR Site”) and FLIR cloud services (collectively the FLIR “Cloud Services”). By using the FLIR Site or Cloud Services, you consent to the collection and use of your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy Only Applies to FLIR
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that FLIR does not own or control, or to the people that FLIR does not employ or manage.
Children’s Privacy Policy
The FLIR Site and Cloud Services are not intended for use by any children, including children under the age of thirteen.  FLIR does not knowingly collect Personal Information online from children under thirteen. If you think that FLIR has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at  the address provided below.  Because FLIR is committed to protecting children’s privacy online, use of the FLIR Site and Cloud Services by children under the age of thirteen is prohibited.
Collection of Personal Information
“Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.  FLIR collects Personal Information in a number of circumstances, including under the following circumstances:
Registrations: To use certain features of the FLIR Site or to use FLIR Cloud Services, you must first complete a registration procedure which requires you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address (providing demographic information, such as your job title, is optional). When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do any of these, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to the FLIR Site.  FLIR collects this information and uses it internally for purposes such as marketing, customer support and administration, technical administration of the FLIR Site and Cloud Services, or to contact you.
Community Forums: You may submit Personal Information to FLIR by using the Community Forum feature of the FLIR Site. Information that you submit in this manner will be subject to the terms contained in our Terms of Use Agreement. To review these terms visit Terms of Use.
Purchases, Contests and Information: You may order e-mail newsletters, join a limited-access premium site, sign up for an event or contest, or purchase FLIR products or services. Personal Information collected by FLIR is often limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information.  For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the shopping area of the FLIR Site, we or our third party service providers will request Personal Information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.
Other:  FLIR may, from time to time, collect other information from you when you voluntarily provide it (for instance, when we make special offers, hold promotions, or conduct surveys). Information collected by these means is used internally for purposes such as marketing, customer administration, technical administration of the FLIR Site, or to contact you.
Use and Security of Personal Information
In addition to the uses described above, we may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:
To allow FLIR to carry out its contractual obligations to you.
To make the FLIR Site and Cloud Services easier for you to use by not making you enter your Personal Information more than once.
To respond to your inquiries and to deliver services that you request or purchase and to provide you with related customer service.
To help us create and publish content and offers most relevant to you.
To send administrative information to you, such as information regarding the FLIR Site and Cloud Services and changes to our terms, conditions and policies.
To send you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions and to administer these activities.  Some of these activities have additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information.
For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our products and services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.
FLIR strictly protects the security of your Personal Information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
FLIR takes precautions to protect our users’ information both online and offline.  Inside FLIR, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.  You also have a significant role in protecting your information.  Except as described in this Privacy Policy, no one can see or edit your Personal Information without knowing your login and password, so do not share these with others.
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information within our organization.  Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below.
Your Personal Information may be transferred to countries other than your own to process and store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and to provide you with products and services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. By using the FLIR Sites, Cloud Services and our products and services, you consent to us transferring your data to these countries.
Personal Information Sharing
FLIR does not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with other people or non-affiliated entities except to provide the products or services you’ve requested, when FLIR has your permission, or under the following circumstances.
We provide the information to trusted third parties who work on behalf of FLIR or with FLIR under confidentiality agreements, including third parties who provide packaging, mailing and delivery services, answer customer questions about products or services, send postal mail, process event registrations and provide other administrative services.  These third parties may use your Personal Information to help FLIR communicate with you and for other reasons.  However, these third parties do not have any independent right to share your Personal Information.
FLIR also works with other vendors, partners, advertisers and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.  This may include other companies who wish to offer our registered customers information about their products and services using postal mail.
For more information regarding these third parties, please contact us at one of the Webmaster email addresses below.
You may submit Personal Information through the Community Forum feature of the FLIR Site.  Any information that you post or disclose through this feature may be available to other users and the general public.  We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose information through the Community Forum feature.
FLIR may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law, including laws outside your country of residence, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on FLIR; (b) protect and defend the rights, property, privacy or safety of FLIR, our affiliates, you or others; or (c) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; or otherwise in response to law enforcement requests (including requests from authorities outside your country of residence).
In the event that FLIR is acquired by or merged into another company, or if FLIR undergoes any reorganization, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of its business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), all information collected will be transferred to the acquiring company as one of FLIR's assets and will be governed by the acquiring company's privacy policy, if any.
Control of your Personal Information
When you register, or otherwise give us Personal Information, FLIR will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than as stated in this Privacy Policy.
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your Personal Information is correct and current. You may review and update the Personal Information you have provided to us at any time, by logging into your personal FLIR account, and may change your marketing preferences.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion.  There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
