Information Privacy Policy
Introduction
Public Transport Victoria (PTV) will collect, use, store and disclose personal information and health information in accordance with Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) set out in the __Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_ (Vic)_ (PDP Act) and the Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) and the __Health Records Act 2001_ (Vic)_.
This policy outlines how PTV manages Personal Information and Health Information. Information is also provided about how people can seek assurance that their Personal Information and/or Health Information is maintained in accordance with the PDP Act and the Health Records Act 2001.
This policy applies to all employees of PTV when dealing with Personal Information or Health Information. Where PTV enters into a contract with another organisation for the provision of goods or services relevant to the functions and powers of PTV, those organisations will be required to manage all Personal Information and Health Information in accordance with the PDP Act and Health Records Act 2001 too, but may have their own relevant privacy policies.
This policy may be varied from time to time and will operate consistently, and in conjunction, with customised privacy policies and collection statements developed by individual business or work units within PTV to explain their particular privacy management practices.
Types of information
Personal Information
Personal information means information or opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from that information or opinion. Some examples of Personal Information are your name, sex, date of birth, address, financial details, marital status, education and employment history. Some Personal Information is called Sensitive Information and is given extra protection under the law. This includes information about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political views, sexual preferences, membership of unions and criminal record.
Information about legal entities, including companies and other organisations, anonymous, de-identified or encrypted information is not personal information.
In this policy, the term Personal Information will refer collectively to Personal Information and Sensitive Information, unless otherwise specified.
Health Information
Health information means information or an opinion that can be linked to an individual, whether living or deceased, that is about their physical, mental or psychological health; disability status; expressed wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her; a health service that has been provided; or a health service that will be provided.
What is not Personal Information?
Information about legal entities (e.g. companies, organisations), anonymous, de-identified, encrypted or information contained in generally available publications is not Personal Information as defined in this Policy and the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014. Publications which are generally available include magazines, books, newspaper articles, annual reports, internet and the Victorian Government Gazette.

PTV will only collect Personal Information or Health Information from an individual if it is necessary for the provision of services to that individual, or to carry out PTV’s functions.
