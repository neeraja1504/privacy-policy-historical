This document outlines our privacy practices for visitors to our websites, regardless of the application used to establish the link, as well as for consumers who apply for or obtain services from us, such as loans, deposits, investments, insurance, or a safe deposit box.

What Information We May Collect
Visitors to Our Website. As a visitor to our website, you remain anonymous unless you register for a service or otherwise choose to disclose your identity to us, for example, logging into Online Banking. Although we do not collect personal information that identifies people who simply visit our site, we may collect certain limited information about our visitors, such as their IP address (a numeric address assigned automatically to computers and mobile devices when they access the Internet).
Customers. We collect your personal information, for example, when you open an account or apply for a loan; use online banking or enroll in a service; enter into an investing relationship or purchase a mutual fund; and use one of our other financial products or services. We also may receive information about you from information services and consumer reporting agencies.
For consumers who apply for financial services from us, the types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include, for example, Social Security number and other personal information; financial history and transactions, account balances, and payment history; and consumer report information and asset and investment experience.
How We May Share Our Customers' Information
We may share our customers’ personal information for our everyday business purposes—such as to process your transactions, maintain your account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus. We may share our customers’ personal information for our marketing purposes; for joint marketing with other financial companies; for our affiliates’ everyday business purposes; and for our affiliates to market to you.
You may exercise choices about some sharing of your personal and financial information with Union Bank and our Affiliates (the family of financial companies related by common ownership or control with Union Bank Companies, which include, but are not limited to, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group) and with other financial companies. Customers can limit our sharing by calling 1-888-283-6699 (our menu will prompt you through your choice(s)) or for hearing-impaired assistance, dial TDD, then 1-800-826-7345.
As a Union Bank online banking customer, you may indicate privacy preferences in a secure session in your online account at unionbank.com by logging on to online banking and changing your Affiliate Information Sharing preferences.
How We Protect Our Customers' Information
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings, as well as information access controls; service provider oversight and confidentiality requirements; employee privacy and information security training; and physical, electronic and procedural safeguards.
