Legal basis for processing personal information
This section applies to European Economic Area visitors only. If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, (ii) where the processing is a contractual necessity, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.

Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “ Cookies ”) to collect and use personal information about you. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Notice.
How does 8x8 keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use include SSL encryption technology for protection of sensitive information such as payments when in transit. We have industry-standard administrative, technical and physical safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal information. Furthermore, in the US we are validated to HIPPAA and FISMA standards, and in the UK we are certified to ISO27001; ISO9000:2015 and Cyber Essentials certification schemes.
International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our Websites servers are located in various locations, including the UK and the US, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing an intra-group agreement based on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfer of personal information between our group companies. 8x8 Inc. also has certified to the European Union-United States Privacy Shield Framework and the United Stated-Swiss Safe Harbor framework .
8x8 also requires such third parties to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Further details can be provided upon request.
Privacy Shield
8x8 Inc. has certified certain of our services, for which we act as a data processor, under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework (the certification can be found here). In the event of any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
Scope:
8x8 Inc. adheres to the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework with respect to personal data of individuals in the European Economic Area member states (“EU Individuals”) included in the content of communications transmitted, received, or stored by 8x8 Inc.’s customers or by 8x8 Inc. on behalf of its customers in reliance on the Privacy Shield through the following services: 8x8 Virtual Office and 8x8 Virtual Contact Center (“Personal Data”).
Data processed:
8x8 Inc. provides cloud communications services, including virtual private branch exchange and virtual contact center services, to business customers. In providing these services, 8x8 Inc. processes the communications our customers transmit, receive, or store through our services or instruct us to process on their behalf. While 8x8 Inc.’s customers decide what, if any, Personal Data to include in such communications, it typically includes information about 8x8 Inc. customers’ users, their current, prospective, or former customers, or any other person or entity communicating with 8x8 Inc. customers.
Purposes for which data is used:
8x8 Inc. may use Personal Data for providing, managing, deploying, enhancing, or improving our services, as otherwise instructed by the 8x8 Inc. customer or other data controller who transmitted, received, or stored the data, or in accordance with contractual requirements. 8x8 Inc. may also use Personal Data for other purposes for which the customer or other data controller has obtained the relevant EU Individual’s consent.
Inquiries and complaints :
If you are an EU Individual covered by Privacy Shield and this Privacy Notice and believe that 8x8 Inc. maintains your Personal Data in one of the services within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, you may submit any privacy or data use concerns concerning such data by email to privacypolicy@8x8.com or by mail to:
8x8, Inc.
2125 O’Nel Drive,
San Jose, CA 95131, USA
Attention: Privacy
8x8 Inc. will respond within 45 days of receiving the communication. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.- based third party dispute resolution provider, TRUSTe (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. truste.com/watchdog/request. TRUSTe has committed to respond to complaints and to provide appropriate recourse at no cost to you. TRUSTe’s Dispute Resolution process is only available in English. If neither 8x8 Inc. nor TRUSTe resolves your complaint, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.
Third parties who may receive Personal Data:
8x8 Inc. may disclose Personal Data to its affiliates, as well as to a limited number of third-party business partners, service providers, vendors, suppliers and other contractors (collectively, “Service Providers”) for the purpose of assisting us in providing, managing, deploying, enhancing, or improving our services. 8x8 Inc. maintains contracts with these 8x8 Inc. affiliates and Service Providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of Personal Data in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and 8x8 Inc. may be liable if such parties fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We also may share or disclose Personal Data to the extent that the customer or other data controller has obtained the relevant EU Individual’s consent.
Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure:
EU Individuals have rights to access their stored Personal Data and to limit its use and disclosure. With our Privacy Shield certification, 8x8 has committed to respect those rights. Because 8x8 Inc. personnel have limited ability to access data our customers or other data controllers transmit, receive, or store through our services, if you are an EU Individual covered by Privacy Shield and this Privacy Notice, and you wish to request access to or to limit use or disclosure of your Personal Data, please provide the name of the 8x8 Inc. customer or other data controller who transmitted, received, or stored your Personal Data through our services. We will refer your request to that customer or other data controller and will support that business as needed in responding to your request.

8x8 Inc. may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, or administrative or judicial process, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Children are not eligible to use 8x8’s website and services, and we ask that minors (under age eighteen) not submit personal information to us. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from an individual under the age of eighteen, we will delete this information from our records.

If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that you have obtained their consent to the processing of their personal data by us (or are otherwise legally entitled to provide us with that information) and that you have informed them of our identity, the purposes for which their personal data will be processed and their rights (as set out in this Privacy Notice), as well as where they can obtain a copy of this Privacy Notice.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
