Pacific University Web Privacy Policy
Introduction
Pacific University is dedicated to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share any personal information gathered from our web servers with any third parties, however in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our web servers such as e-mails sent to the web site, and information collected from web-based forms.
Pacific University also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to Pacific students, Pacific University is equally commited to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our web site.
Pacific University's web site consists of hundreds of web servers. Some sites hosted by Pacific may adopt different privacy statements as their specific needs require. If another Pacific web site has a privacy statement that is different from this statement, that policy must be approved by University Relations and University Information Services, and it must be posted on their site. However, those sites cannot adopt a privacy statement that in any way supersedes federal or state regulations.
External Web Sites
Pacific University's web site contains links to hundreds of external web sites. The University is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the external web sites we link to.
Information We Gather
Our web servers generate temporary logs that contain the following information:

Date and Time
The data is used in aggregate by system administrators and web content managers to tune the web site for its efficiency and is not associated with specific individuals. Data from the web server logs are only shared with the content manager of each web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help web publishers determine what web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show a particular web page is very popular or used more by freshmen than by seniors, we use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.
