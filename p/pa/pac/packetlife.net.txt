Cookies
Cookies are used to track limited user information; primarily, the session ID of a registered user who has logged in with his or her username and password. Other cookies may be assigned by Google Analytics and third-party advertisers. Advertisers rely on cookies for uniquely but anonymously tracking individual users and for geographically targeting their advertisements. PacketLife.net does not present advertisements from companies proven or suspected to be presenting advertisements of a malicious or questionable nature.
You can opt to disable some or all of these cookies in your browser's preferences if you'd like. However, be aware that disabling this site's session ID or CSRF token cookie will prevent you from logging in to the site as a registered user.
