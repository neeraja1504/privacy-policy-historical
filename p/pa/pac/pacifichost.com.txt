Pacifichost may from time to time also communicate with you on behalf of our marketing partners. Pacifichost will also in some instances share your personally identifiable information with our approved marketing partners for marketing purposes related to specific special offers that we believe you would like to receive based upon the services that you express an interest in from us. We require all marketing partners to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act and all other applicable laws. We require that each such marketing partner provide a conspicuous opt-out link for your use to remove your information from their email list. Furthermore, if you wish us not to share your email address or other personally identifiable information you may contact us by email at support@Pacifichost.com.
Surveys or Contests
On occasion we provide hosting customers with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
If the contest or survey requires, permits or is otherwise related to the submission by you to us of any story, artwork, photograph or other such material this information and material may be used to select a winner and tabulate survey results. In addition, we may use any such submission pursuant to the relevant portion of our Terms of Service to display to other hosting customers or non-hosting customers whether or not in conjunction with information from our advertisers or partners.
Additional Information
In addition to the registration information set forth above, PACIFICHOST also records and tracks your IP address, and browser type for purposes of security, maintaining the web site and ensuring the best possible user experience. This non-personally identifiable information is also tabulated in the aggregate for purposes of determining broad demographic usage information and is, on occasion, shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to our hosting customers. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
Information that you may choose to post on the Service including any text entries, photos, videos or other content are displayed to other hosting customers and, at times, are available to unregistered web site visitors.
