We will not share or rent this personal information with or to anyone else in any way that is different from what is disclosed to you in this policy. We may collect information from several different points on our website or the websites of PartyLite Consultants, when you make a purchase from one of our Consultants or have other interactions where personal data is provided.
At certain points in interactive communication with us, you might provide us with personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. Demographic personal information such as income level, gender, and other personal information of yours may be provided by you on an optional basis.
We may also gather on line information regarding your purchases and shopping activities on websites we host (such as those of PartyLite Consultants) to improve the content, ease of use and shopping experience on those websites and to improve our marketing and promotions for our company overall and the websites in particular.
In addition, our web server may automatically collect the following non-personally identifiable information; your internet service provider’s address, the referring URL and the information on the pages you access on our site or on the sites of the PartyLite Consultants since we host those websites.
Personal information that you provide to PartyLite will be used by us for the purposes of enabling a PartyLite Consultant or Leader to contact you at your request for the purposes of you becoming a PartyLite Consultant or PartyLite Host. PartyLite may also use your personal information to contact you to keep you informed of developments or opportunities in relation to PartyLite, or any of its products or services.
We may also use information collected when you make a purchase on line through a Consultant Website or at a PartyLite show in order to process your order or purchase, provide warrenty service or advise you of promotions and PartyLite product news. We may also send you emails with offers from marketing partners which have products or service we believe might be of interest to you.
We do use third party companies to gather information and provide services to us, for example in maintaining and organizing customer information and conducting promotions, upgrading our internet services, sending communications and contacting our customers. Some of those third parties will and do have access to the information which customers provide, including email addresses and credit card information and they may also use cookies on behalf of PartyLite.
We may also use third party providers to serve ads for PartyLite products or services throughout the internet. They may provide anonymous information regarding your visits to a PartyLite website (or that of a PartyLite Consultant) and your interaction with the goods and services which PartyLite provides. They may also use information about your visits to PartyLite and other web sites to target advertisements for goods or services. Your anonymous information is collected through a pixel tab, a standard technology used at most major consumer websites. This technology does not require the use or collection of any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.
