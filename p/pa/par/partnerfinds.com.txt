Use of Collected Information
To perform a standard job search on the Sites, we do not require the transfer of any personal information. In common with other websites, log files are stored on the web server saving details such as the visitor's IP address, browser type, referring page and time of visit (“Log Files”). If a user subscribes to the delivery of email-based jobs (“Email Job Alerts”), we collect that user’s email address, search phrase, and location (“Information”), and store the Information on our servers. This information is used to deliver, via email, relevant job openings to a subscriber. There is no charge to subscribe to Email Job Alerts. The information collected is not sold, leased, gifted, or shared with any third party service. A visitor may unsubscribe from Email Job Alerts by following the instructions which are included in the job alert email.
In addition to standard user information (name, company, website, address, city, and zip), companies or agencies purchasing products and services, will be required to provide all information necessary to process billing transactions.
To simplify the sign-in process and enhance the experience of the Sites, we offer the ability to sign in using certain 3rd party services (including, but not limited to: Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, & Yahoo). Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and PartnerFinds.com shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying information by any third party.
