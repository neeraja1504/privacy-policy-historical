What personally identifiable information does CBR collect from me?
CBR collects information in several ways from our websites. In general, you can visit our websites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, but you are required to enroll in order to obtain access to our services and to certain parts of our websites. By providing your personal information to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to enroll in newborn stem cell banking on our website CBR asks for certain personal information, including your name, address, e-mail, zip code, credit card, phone, and a portion of a government issued identification number as well as certain health-related information such as the expected due date, your health care plan, delivery hospital and doctor or midwife. Once you enroll, you are no longer anonymous to CBR - you are given a CBR ID and are able to take full advantage of CBR's offerings. When you enroll you will also be asked to set a security question, and will be required to provide the answer for authentication purposes when you log in to your account.
You may request information about clinical trials without enrolling. If you choose to participate in this feature of our website you will be asked to provide your name, address, email, phone and medical condition in which you are interested. You can also request information from CBR; we may ask for your contact information, due date and other information that will help us assist you. Some information is required while other information may be submitted at your option. Certain websites offer community discussion boards, and you will be asked to provide your full name, zip code, and email address, and to generate a password. You will also be asked to provide your mailing address (although that is not required to set up an account). If you create a personalized start page for certain websites or request a subscription to a one or more of the newsletters offered on a website, you will also be asked to provide your full name, zip code, and email address, and to generate a password.
In addition, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you answer a survey, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by CBR, and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact CBR we may keep a record of that correspondence. CBR also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever CBR collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
CBR also collects information that does not personally identify our site visitors. This may include the visitor's domain name and IP address, but not the email address. This information ("Site Usage Information") is aggregated to measure certain traffic patterns on our websites, such as the number of visits, average time spent on the website, pages viewed, and so on.

How does CBR protect my personal, financial, and health-related information? What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
Keeping your personal, financial, and health-related information private is important to us. There are several places on the CBR site where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Anytime we ask for a credit card number we transmit that number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
Whenever CBR handles personal information, regardless of where this occurs, CBR takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have in place administrative, technical and physical measures aimed at preventing the loss or misuse of the information that you provide to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, due to factors beyond our control, CBR cannot ensure or warrant that your personally identifiable information or any other information collected by us will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or other third parties or from other criminal activities. Therefore, you provide information at your own risk.
It is also important for you to help protect against unauthorized access to your information. You are solely responsible for signing off of our Web site each time you finish using it and for securing your log-in information and security responses. Any transactions using your log-in and security responses will be deemed to be authorized by you.
