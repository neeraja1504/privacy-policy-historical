When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on the Site or Services, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users will be able to see it, along with your profile photo and any other information that you choose to make public on your public profile page ( “Profile” ).

Information Collected via Technology.
Information Collected by Our Servers. To make the Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ( “ISP” ), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site and Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some information may be collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and the information can then be used to serve information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.
Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Site and Services. This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. We use the following types of cookies:
Essential Cookies - These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided.
Functionality Cookies - These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use the Services, such as login details and progress within a course. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the Services.
Analytics and Performance Cookies - These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how they are used. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes information like the number of visitors to the Services, the websites that referred them to the Services, the pages they visited on the Services, what time of day they visited the Services, and whether they have visited the Services before. We use this information to help operate the Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on the Services.
We use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Facebook, Optimizely, and Segment for this purpose. You can find out more information about these cookies at the following links:
Google Analytics - Read more about Google Analytics Cookies here and the Google Analytics Privacy Policy here. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of the Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link.

* _Pixel Tag_ In addition, we use **“pixel tags** ” (also referred to as clear GIFs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users’ Personal Data.
* _Do Not Track Signals_.Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit [Do Not Track](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).
* _Flash LSOs_. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “ **flash cookies** ,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies, click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).
* _Mobile Services_. We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our mobile application. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use the application, and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our application. This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
* _Analytics Services._ In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you use the Services. This includes third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics ( **“Analytics Services”** ), that we engage to help analyze how users use the Services. We may receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Site and Services. The information generated by the cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site and Services (the **“Analytics Information”** ) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. See “Cookies” above for additional information about Analytics Services and links to their terms and policies.
