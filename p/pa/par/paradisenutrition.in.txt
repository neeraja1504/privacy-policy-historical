Usage Information
We (including through our third party service providers) may inactively collect from you information that is not in the same category as Personal Information. For example, we might track information about the date and time you access the Sites, the type of web browser you used, and the websites from which you connect to our Sites. We collect and use this and other non-Personal Information (such as demographic data) to analyze and develop our business strategy and to determine how you found out about us, your interests regarding our products and services and how to further improve our Sites. We, or a third party, may also collect information from your activities on the Sites for the purposes of providing advertisements and other content to you at the Sites that are customized to your interests and preferences. To accomplish all this, and also to allow us to offer our customers streamlined ordering and other useful features, we, as do many websites, use the technologies listed below and other similar technologies (the “ Tracking Technologies ”):
Cookies and Clear GIFs - Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information (i.e. username, password, shopping cart information, etc.) while you’re at our Sites. Cookies also track where you travel on our Sites and what you look at and purchase. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.
IP Address Tracking and Clickstream Data - In addition to cookies and clear GIFs, our servers automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit our Sites. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or “ IP Address ”, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you view pages from our Sites, our servers may record or “log” your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.

In some cases, we may link the non-Personal Information collected through the Tracking Technologies with certain of your Personal Information. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ACCEPTING TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER IN NO WAY GIVES US ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.
