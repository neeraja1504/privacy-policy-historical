We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the PartyGaming sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors. In addition, We may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and maintain your online account. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services, and We will use the Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy below.

In order to play real money games on the Service, you will be required to send money to and receive money from Us. We may use third-party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions ('ESPs') to process such financial transactions. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to Personal Information necessary for the processing of transactions being shared with ESPs, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with ESPs protect your privacy.

We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity, age, the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the Service and your financial transactions for potential breach of Our Terms and Conditions and of applicable law. By accepting Our Terms and Conditions you authorise Us, Our staff, agents and suppliers to use your Personal Information and to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide to Us in the course of using the Services, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country.

In addition, to facilitate these security reviews, you agree to provide such information or documentation as We may request.
10. CONSENT TO USE OF ANTI-CHEATING SOFTWARE
Our software package - used to access and use the Service - contains certain features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on Our site. Use of such 'bot' software programs violates Our Terms and Conditions, where We deem it detrimental to other players. By installing Our software and using the Service, you consent to Our software performing the functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that We maintain a 'cheat free' environment for all users: (1) scan your list of active software applications while you are using the Service; (2) scan your list of active processes while you are using the service; and (3) scan the files in your PartyGaming site-related program folders to ensure that only 'non-hacked' versions of Our software are being used. If any of the foregoing processes reveals a suspect application or process, Our software may scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and compile a composite mesh (i.e., a profile that characterizes the files associated with the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit automated programs. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information to Us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software will not alter any files or information on your computer or other equipment and will not interfere with the operation of any of your applications. You may terminate use of Our software at any time by uninstalling the Our software package.
11. SECURITY
We understand the importance of information security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the Personal Information We receive directly from you in a password-protected database residing within Our secure network behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. Our online sites and the Service support SSL Version 3 with 128-bit encryption. We take steps to ensure Our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels of security.
12. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN
The Service is not intended for or directed at persons under the age of 18 (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction). Any person who provides their information to Us through any part of the Service represents to Us that they are 18 years of age (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction) or older. It is Our policy to uncover attempts by minors to access Our Services which may involve Us having to access and verify your Personal Information. This may involve Us having to access and verify your Personal Information. If We become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via the online site, We will not accept this information and will take steps to remove such information from Our records.
13. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Personal Information collected on the Service may be stored and processed in any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, you expressly consent to any transfer of information outside of your country (including to third countries that may not have been assessed as having adequate privacy laws). Nevertheless, We take steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with Our standards of privacy regardless of their location.
14. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES
We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to a third-party online site that links to or from the PartyGaming sites or any information collected by any third party administering Our affiliate program or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us. Any information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions about a third party's information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties, and We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such online sites.
15. LEGAL DISCLAIMER
The Service operates 'AS-IS' and 'AS-AVAILABLE,' without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We cannot guarantee nor do We represent that there will be error-free performance regarding the privacy of your Personal Information, and We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release of Personal Information.
16. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER
If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We are entitled to share the Personal Information and all other information you have provided through the Service to potential and subsequent business and merger partners.
