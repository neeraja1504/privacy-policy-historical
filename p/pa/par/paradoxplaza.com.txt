The Paradox Interactive servers, or the servers of companies that are used to operate the Site, may place a “cookie” on your computer in order to allow you to use the Site and to personalize your experience. A cookie can be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to recognize your computer while you are on the Site and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you. Cookies are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in for users, tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions. The information collected from cookies may also be used to improve the functionality of the Site and to measure traffic patterns.
There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach their expiry date.  You are entitled to choose whether or not you would like to use cookies. If you do not consent to the use of cookies, please be sure to block or disable them using your browser settings as described below or the opt-out link provided to you on your first visit to the Site.
Paradox Interactive uses the following cookies on the Site, for the following purposes:
a) Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the Site to function. They are usually set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site might then not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information;
b) Performance Cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources in order to measure and improve the performance of the Site. These cookies help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and how visitors move around the Site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our Site, and will not be able to monitor its performance;
c) Functionality Cookies: These cookies enable the Site to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services have been added to the Site. If you do not allow these cookies, some or all of these services may not function properly;

Such advertisements or content may use cookies to help track and target the interests of users of the Site in order to present customized and personalized advertisements or other messages that the user might find interesting. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and Internet device. Such cookies may even impact your experience of other websites you may visit subsequently. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. Paradox Interactive is not responsible for any such cookies.

4. Information Use and Storage Period
Paradox Interactive may use Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Site, Game or Account to, among other things, respond to inquiries or comments, to verify the identity of users, to maintain or administer user accounts, to maintain the security and integrity of the Site and its data, to provide support to users, to process transactions, to communicate with users regarding transactions made via the Site, to improve and personalize the Site for user preferences, to provide users with product or service updates, promotional notices, and to offer services and products of interest to users.
Paradox Interactive uses the anonymous information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our Site and Game. We may also use aggregated anonymous information to provide information about our Site to advertisers, potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. Again, this information is not personally identifiable.
Paradox Interactive will not store Personally Identifiable Information longer than necessary for the purpose of the collection. Due to tax regulations however, Paradox Interactive usually stores any collected information (Personally Identifiable Information and anonymous information) for a period of five (5) years.
5. Disclosure of Information
We may use unaffiliated companies to help us maintain and operate the Site or for other reasons related to the operation of our business, and those companies may receive your Personally Identifiable Information for that purpose. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you in connection with legal requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, governmental request or investigation, or as otherwise permitted by law. Finally, we may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions user information may be one of the transferred business assets. If Paradox Interactive or certain of its assets are acquired, user information may be transferred. Paradox Interactive does not sell Personally Identifiable Information to third parties.
6. Security
Paradox Interactive maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help guard Personally Identifiable Information. If transactions are offered on the Site, transaction information is transmitted to and from the Site in encrypted form using industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections to help protect such information from interception. Paradox Interactive restricts authorized access to your personal information to those persons who have a legitimate purpose to know that information to provide products or services to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information. Paradox Interactive also has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (e.g., verification of Site user’s identity through username and password). Please be aware, however, that any e-mail or other transmission you send through the Internet cannot be completely protected against unauthorized interception, and it is your sole responsibility to protect the secrecy of your password.
