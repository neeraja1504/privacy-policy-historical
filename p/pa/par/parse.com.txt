1. Web Site Covered
This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of http://parse.com.
2. Information Collected
Parse offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the “Services.” Parse collects information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web site (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”).
When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Parse requires you to provide the Company with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, Parse requires you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). Parse may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry, or you may choose to provide information about the end users of your application (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information, are referred to collectively as “Data About Parse Customers.”
As you navigate the Company’s Web site, Parse may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web site (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).
3. Use of Information Collected
The Company uses Data About Parse Customers to perform and support the services. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.
The Company may also use Data About Parse Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.
Parse uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Services. Parse uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company’s Web site. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About Parse Customers to provide personalized information about the Company.
4. Web Site Navigational Information
Parse uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web site (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web site and how this information may be used.
4.1 Cookies - Parse uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Parse’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Parse, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. Parse uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to Parse, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.
Parse uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.
Parse may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Parse Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.
4.2 Web Beacons - Parse uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web site and interaction with emails from the Company.

For example, Parse may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web site.
