Kate says: If you email the support service with a message requiring a response, I will only use that email address to attempt to contact you on matters relating to the issue you raised. The contents of your message may be shared with other Parsimonious staff members if the query relates to their creations and requires them to contribute towards the answer BUT all staff members are also legally bound to honor the site's privacy policy.
We will NOT share personal data with ANY 3rd party except in very exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to report details of serious illegal activity.
Please note that there will always be the possibility of an unauthorized breach of the site's web servers, it is sadly the nature of the internet. Under such circumstances I have no control over how stored data may be used and am not responsible for the consequences, however, I have taken every reasonable precaution to prevent this.
