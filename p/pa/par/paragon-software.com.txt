The hashed data is securely stored on the server for 5 years and then deleted. The data is not shared with third parties.
One product may offer several free trial options. For that, the app needs to uniquely identify users in order to understand which trial they have already used, which they have not; and to track time of the trial in-use. Validating the trial is the only reason for the anonymized data collection.
