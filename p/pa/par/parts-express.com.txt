We believe in complete transparency in the obtaining and usage of your personal data.

Please read on for more detail about our privacy/security policies.
Acceptance of Privacy Policy
In order to process orders, create a store account, post a review, provide requested marketing notifications, accept a contest entry, display a submitted project or maintain general business interaction, we need to process the personal information you have provided. By reading this policy, you are confirming that you have read and understand how and why we use your information. You are not required to provide the personal information requested. If personal data is not provided, we will simply not be able to continue with any transactions or business interaction.
Personal Information We Collect
When you create a store account, purchase a product, download a manual or software update, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a product quote, register for a commercial account, participate in a survey, join our mailing list, participate in a forum, contact us in general or engage in a business interaction, a variety of information may be collected, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, IP address, location information, device identification, and credit card information. In certain cases we may request proof of business ownership and additional personal information for purposes of establishing a commercial account or extending credit terms.
There may be times when non-personal or identifiable information is collected such as online store browsing behavior, product interaction or shopping habits, of which none is combined with personal information for identification purposes. This information is solely used to create a better shopping experience or product offering.
Information, Use and Control
We may process your personal information provided with your consent, for purposes as described above in order to complete a transaction or business interaction. We may also use this information to update you on product announcements, upcoming events, sweepstakes notifications, software updates, product purchases or transactional notifications.

Your consent to use of personal data may be revoked at any time upon request.
How does Parts Express protect customer information?
Parts Express takes the security of your personal data very seriously and has long implemented layers of protection to protect your privacy. When you place orders or access your order information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
In select cases, you may choose to share personal information such as your name or contact information in reviews, forum posts, product questions or social media interaction. You are responsible for the personal information you have chosen to share in these instances, and this information does not fall under the protection of our privacy policies. Please exercise care when using any of these features as usage is at your discretion.
Will Parts Express disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
Parts Express does not and will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. All information gathered from purchases, surveys, newsletter sign ups and other online activities are used by Parts Express to track sales, maintain customer service and handle marketing related issues. In the event of sweepstakes submissions, your permission is required via a clearly defined opt-in on the entry form in order to provide our partner with your email address or contact information.
Safety Guarantee
We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
We Do Not Disclose Your Private Online Communications
We honor the confidentiality of our customers' private e-mail communications with Parts Express, as well as any profile data you may create.
