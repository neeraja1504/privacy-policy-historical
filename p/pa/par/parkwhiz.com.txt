What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?
If you choose to register with ParkWhiz (become a Registered User ) to take advantage of ParkWhiz's extensive benefits, you will be asked to provide a name, a telephone number, an email address, a password of your choice and your primary driving city. You may select not to receive emails from ParkWhiz (and/or from parking facilities which are part of the ParkWhiz Network), other than automated service messages pertaining to the information you may have requested (i.e. reservations, real-time status, availability). Where you have consented to receive marketing material from ParkWhiz and/or parking facilities at which you made a request and/or reservation, ParkWhiz will collect data on the category and location at which you have made the request in order to send you marketing communications which match your preferences. This can be accomplished via ParkWhiz's email opt-out function. You may also unsubscribe from the ParkWhiz email list at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe@parkwhiz.com and from a parking facility's email list by contacting them directly.
You may be invited via email to provide feedback on your parking experience by completing a web-based Parking Feedback Form ("Feedback Form"). Parking feedback may be used to enhance the information on the ParkWhiz.com website and/or to let parking facilities know how they are doing. Any feedback you provide will be summarized with that of other drivers. Your feedback will not be publicized in a way that is attributable to you by name, email address, or other identifiable form. You may select not to receive future feedback invitation emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of the Feedback Form.
Parking facilities may receive summary reports of collective feedback from recent parking patrons. Any ratings you choose to provide based on your parking experience will be aggregated with those of other patrons so that they are not identifiable to you. If you provide comments about the parking facility, these may be shared with that facility but anonymously.
If you express interest in receiving offers or information from ParkWhiz.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only ParkWhiz.com (or agents working on behalf of ParkWhiz.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers.
You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those ParkWhiz.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate.
ParkWhiz.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service.
How does ParkWhiz.com protect my personal financial information?
Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. As with all personal information, ParkWhiz.com will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission.
Please note that there may be places on the ParkWhiz.com network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
Can I change my personal preferences?
Once a Registered User logs in to ParkWhiz.com, that user can view the personal information stored by ParkWhiz by clicking on the "Your Profile" link at the top of the page. In addition to being able to view your recent ParkWhiz reservation history, every user is also able to view and change the following personal information: name, email address, password, phone number, primary driving city, birthday (if it has been provided by the user), address (if it has been provided by the user), special requests that should be forwarded to parking facilties when making reservations (if they have been provided by the user), and whether that user would like to receive email from ParkWhiz. The user at anytime may request all personal information returned to the user, which may be accomplished by contacting ParkWhiz.
What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ParkWhiz.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
