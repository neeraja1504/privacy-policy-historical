Your privacy matters to us. We aim to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, respect your privacy. We’ve crafted the policy below to be as clear and straightforward as possible. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or feedback at support@paribus.co.
1. Introduction
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers how Paribus Co. (“we,” “us,” “our,” and “Paribus”) treats Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and other information that Paribus collects in connection with its websites, mobile applications, platforms, premium services, or any content or information provided as part of the Paribus services (collectively, “Paribus” or the “Services”).
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your registration or use of any part of the Services will constitute your notice about and agreement to our collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to us collecting or using your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services and close your account.
We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use the Services. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use the Services after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.
2. Scope of Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the Services. It does not apply to information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Services.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties.
We consider PII to be information that can be traced directly back to and identifies a specific individual or household, such as name, physical address, email address, phone number, or billing information. We do not consider PII to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual or household. Paribus does not share PII with non-affiliated third parties except as specified in Section 4.5, Section 4.7, and Section 4.8

By registering with or using the Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of the Terms of Service and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy.

4.3 Customized Content and Improved Experience
We use the information that you provide to us to customize content and improve your user experience. For example, information regarding your online purchases, offline purchases, and shopping history allows us monitor price changes for products you purchased and file claims on your behalf.
We also use the information that you provide us to improve our products and services for all users, conduct research, and develop and maintain anonymous and aggregated data and analytics. For example, information regarding your online purchases, aggregated with the information of other users, allows us to decipher industry wide trends.
4.4. Sharing Information with Affiliates
We may share your PII with our Paribus affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Paribus) as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing.
Any Paribus affiliate will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.
4.5. Sharing Information with Service Providers
We may employ third parties and individuals to develop, improve, and/or facilitate our Services (e.g. maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to your PII only to perform these tasks on our behalf.
You recognize and agree that these third parties may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. Paribus is not responsible for any information these companies have independently collected and used under their own privacy policies.
4.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties
Paribus does not share PII with non-affiliated third parties except as specified in Section 4.5, Section 4.7, and Section 4.8
We may share anonymous and aggregated information and analytics relating to you with third parties. Such information may be of value to third parties in the performance of marketing services, including evaluating market trends and/or under a joint marketing agreement to provide services that will be of particular interest and relevance to you. When you deactivate your Paribus account, your PII is permanently disassociated with your purchase information. We may continue to use and share any anonymous and aggregated information and analytics relating to you.
When you deactivate your Paribus account, your PII is permanently disassociated with your purchase data. The anonymized purchase data itself may continue to be incorporated in market analyses.
4.7 Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures
It is possible that we may need to disclose your PII to third parties when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if Paribus has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the Terms of Service, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Services; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Paribus, our users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overboard, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand.
4.8 Disclosure to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Paribus Co
We may disclose your PII to a third party as part of a transfer or sale of the assets of Paribus Co., a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events.
Any third party to which Paribus transfers or sells Paribus’ assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.

We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement.

Paribus limits access to your PII. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and use correctly the PII we collect from you.
No data transmissions through the Internet or mobile devices, or even the physical transfer of information, are completely secure. We cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal information, and technical mistakes are possible. We do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit to us and any information you disclose to us is at your own risk. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.
If Paribus learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically. You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view and access Paribus. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at support@paribus.co.
