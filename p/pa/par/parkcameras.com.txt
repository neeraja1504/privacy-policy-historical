Privacy Policy | Park Cameras - Protecting Your Privacy
At Park Cameras, we are committed to protecting your privacy. Our approach is to keep your data safe, and by trusting us with your data we commit never to pass it on to other companies.
This policy explains how we collect and use personal data that we may collect about you when you interact with us. We collect and process data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We do not disclose data to any third parties unless disclosure is necessary for the fulfilment of a service, you have specifically given consent for a particular service, or we have a legitimate interest in disclosing data. Instances in which we do disclose data to third parties are outlined below.
Please contact us by email at sales@parkcameras.com if you need any further information on our privacy policy. This policy was last updated on 04 June 2018.

Contract – we need to collect and process your personal data to fulfil a contract with you; for example if you place an order or ask for a quote.
Legal obligation – where necessary we are obliged to process personal data to comply with the law; for example if you place an order with us we must retain some personal data for at least six years to comply with HMRC and our obligations under legislation including the Sale of Goods Act 1982 and Consumer Rights Act of 2015.
Legitimate interests – we collect and process some personal data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way you that would reasonably be expected as part of running our business; for example to better understand our customers so as to provide products and services.

Protecting personal data

The checkout process on our website is held on a secure server using SSL (secure socket layer) technology to transfer data, which is evidenced by a small padlock symbol next to the web address in your browser. You can verify the security certificate in place by clicking on the padlock symbol.
Sharing personal data
We may need to share your personal data with third parties. In such cases your data will only be shared with parties who adhere to GDPR, data will only be used for the exact purpose we specify, data will be transferred and stored securely and will be deleted or anonymised if we stop working with that third party.

Retaining personal data
We keep your data for as long as it’s needed, after which time it will be deleted or anonymised such that any personal data is removed.
We retain customer data for 6 years for legal purposes, and to ensure that we are able to assist with any issue that might arise from a previous purchase. After 6 years we will remove your data unless you have consented to our marketing activity.
If we provide you with a quote and you don’t consent to marketing, we’ll keep your data for 12 months in case you wish to proceed.
If you provide us with proof of identity or proof of address we keep this data for 3 months, at which point it is permanently deleted.
