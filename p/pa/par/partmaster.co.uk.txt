View Secure Shopping
We recognise the importance of security regarding credit card information you send us over the Internet. We take all the necessary precautions to protect our customers' personal information and to store it securely. You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for a locked padlock icon (Internet Explorer & Firefox) in the grey bar at the bottom of your screen. This will appear on any page where you are entering personal information (such as your credit card details) – no other page will transmit information about you.
Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card numbers) are encrypted and transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Also, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
At Partmaster we utilise the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all your personal information including debit or credit card numbers, name and address. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code that are then securely transmitted over the Internet.
Other than when we process your original payment or process a refund for you, your credit card details are displayed in a truncated form with only the first 4 digits and the last 4 digits visible. For example your receipt will print a partial credit card number in this way. This means that you will be able to check which card payment was taken against, but in the unlikely event of your parcel being stolen, your full credit card number would not be revealed.
In order to help safeguard unauthorised use of your credit or debit card we check the security code located above the magnetic strip on the back of your card and also the address provided on the order with the address set against the card. This means that you can be rest assured that Partmaster takes all the necessary steps to ensure shopping with us is safe.
Should you wish to speak to us about a previously confirmed order, our staff will never ask you to quote your full credit card.
At the point in the order process where you enter your card details our e-commerce system will request confirmation that the details provided are correct as explained in the sections above.
Most banks now include the Verified by Visa and MasterCard® SecureCode™ virtual 'card present' environment. These are additional security systems which may appear as part of the final stages of the ordering phase.
Should your bank use one of the above systems you will be prompted to enter a password or code in order to proceed. The web page which prompts for this information is provided by your bank where you use a Visa or Mastercard® credit or debit card. The information transmitted from this page is between you and your bank and is in no way used or processed by us. As soon as the card/password is verified you will be returned to our web site to complete your order.
At the point at which this page displays, one of two things will happen. You will be prompted to enrol in the respective cards scheme, where you have not already done so (you will be prompted to create a password or code as part of the enrolment process), alternatively you will be prompted for your password if already enrolled.
Customers can contact or visit their banks website for more information and to enrol independently of this or any other web site.
MasterCard®SecureCode™ Explained
MasterCard®SecureCode™ is a simple and secure method of payment at online stores. You will have a private code known only to you and to your bank, your SecureCode™ enhances your existing MasterCard® account by protecting you against unauthorised use of your card when shopping online at participating online retailers.
Every time you pay online at participating retailers, you will be automatically prompted to enter your own private SecureCode™ - just like entering a PIN at a cash machine. In seconds, you gain added protection while shopping online.

2. Your preferences and use of email updates, recorded by emails we send you (if you select to receive email updates on products and offers).
Verified by Visa Explained
Verified by Visa is a simple password-protected identity-checking service that takes the risk out of online shopping for both retailers and customers. Retailers are protected against fraudulent transactions and the costs associated with it, while customers can spend with confidence knowing that their payment details are safe.
