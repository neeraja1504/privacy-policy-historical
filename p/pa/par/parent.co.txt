Cookies, Web Beacons, and Advertising.
We also use cookies on our Services. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your web browser. A cookie allows our Services to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect information about your use of our Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your computer's operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before the Site, and the link you used to leave the Site. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of our Services may not operate correctly.
Our Services or the emails that you receive from Motherly may use an application known as a "web beacon" (also known as a "clear gif"). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.
We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze and use some of the personal and non-personal information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on our Services or in email communications from us. This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including online behavioral advertising, as discussed below.
Recommending to Contacts. If you use our Services to send invitations to your contacts to recommend they use our Services, their names and e-mail addresses of the contacts you select will be collected by our servers so we can send them invitations.
Location-Based Information. If you allow location-based tracking through your mobile device, we will receive information regarding your precise location (using the GPS antenna within your device) when you use our Services with your device. We also receive information from the compass on your mobile device, including course, velocity and altitude. This allows your posts within our Services to be tagged with your location, and may also post when you are in transit or your location has changed. Location and compass information is used to ascertain where you are located when you capture videos and photos or check in, allowing us to associate your videos, photos and location with that of other users in close proximity to you to create compilations. We may use location information to incorporate your photos or videos with those of your friends who are nearby, or to suggest friends to you who are nearby and/or are in your friend network. We may also use the location of a video, photo or check in to determine what advertising should be shown in connection with that posting.
