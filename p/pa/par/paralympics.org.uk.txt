This includes when you phone us, visit our website, or get in touch through the post.
When you interact with us through third parties : This could be if you interact with a third party such as Just Giving, a commercial Partner, or one of the other third parties that we work with and provide your consent for your personal information to be shared with us.
When you visit our website : We gather general information which might include which pages you visit most often and which services, events or information is of most interest to you.

Wherever possible we use anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our website.
3. Information we collect and why we use it
Personal information we collect may include details such as your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number and credit/debit card details (if you are making a donation), as well as information you provide in any communications between us. You will have given us this information in one of the ways set out in section 2 above.
We will mainly use this information:
For the purpose of administrating the service or event that you have provided your personal information in relation to, including updating you with important administrative messages.
To process your donations or other payments, to claim Gift Aid on your donations and verify any financial transactions.
To comply with the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Act 2016 and follow the recommendations of the official regulator of charities, the Charity Commission, which require us to identify and verify the identity of supporters who make major gifts so we can assess any risks associated with accepting their donations.
To keep a record of your relationship with us.
Where you volunteer or work with us, to administer the contract or volunteering arrangement.
To personalise the way our website is presented when you visit to make improvements and to ensure we provide the best service and experience for you.
To contact you about our work and how you can support us
To invite you to participate in surveys or research, or to carry out analytical research to help us improve the services we offer
We will always ensure that we have a legal basis for using your personal information (see section 3 below for more information on this). If you do not provide certain information, we may not be able to process your donation, or sign you up for a particular event or service.
4. Legal basis for using your information
We will only use your personal information where we have a legal basis for doing so.
In some instances this will be where we have your consent, or because we need to use your personal information to fulfil a contract with you. In this case, we will only contact you about our work and how you can support us by phone, email or text message, if you have agreed for us to contact you in this manner.
You can update your choices or stop us sending you these communications at any time by contacting info@paralympics.org.uk or clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the relevant communication.
However, there are other lawful reasons that allow us to process your personal information and one of those is called ‘legitimate interests’. This means that the reason that we are processing information is because there is a legitimate interest for us to process your information to help us to achieve our vision to through sport, inspire a better world for disabled people. As well as important business administration, this might include us getting in touch with information about our work and how to support us, where we judge that there is a relevant and legitimate interest in you receiving this information.
Whenever we process your Personal Information under the ‘legitimate interest’ lawful basis we make sure that we take into account your rights and interests and will not process your personal information if we feel that it is not appropriate.
5. Sharing your Information
The personal information we collect about you will mainly be used by our staff (and volunteers) so that they can support you.
We will never sell or share your personal information with organisations so that they can contact you for any marketing activities. Nor do we sell any information about your web browsing activity.
We may however share your information with our trusted partners and suppliers who work with us on or on our behalf to deliver our services, but processing of this information is always carried out under our instruction. Our policy is to make sure that they store the data securely, delete it when they no longer need it and never use it for any other purposes. Some examples of where we may share your information are with our fulfilment partners who help to create and send information to you to reduce our costs, with our partners who help us to process donations and claim Gift Aid.
We will enter into contracts with these service providers that require them to comply with Data Protection Laws and ensure that they have appropriate controls in place to secure your information.
Legal disclosure
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law (for example, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice or in response to a valid request from a competent authority); or, in order to enforce our conditions of sale and other agreements.
6. Keeping your information safe
We take looking after your information very seriously. We have implemented appropriate measures to protect the personal information we have under our control, both on and off-line, from improper access, use, alteration, destruction and loss.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information using the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information sent to us this way, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site.
Any debit or credit card details which we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing partner, according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.
7. How long we hold your information for
We only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary for the relevant activity, which may be to fulfil statutory obligations (for example, the collection of Gift Aid). As a safeguard against holding data for too long, if your personal data is not used for 24 months we will review the legal basis for holding it and if we no longer have either your consent, or a legitimate interest for processing your data, it will be deleted.
You have various rights in respect of the personal information we hold about you – these are set out in more detail below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights or make a complaint, you can do so by contacting us:

Restriction : You can ask us to restrict the personal information we use about you where you have asked for it to be erased or where you have objected to our use of it.
No automated-decision making : Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions that will create legal effects or have a similar significant impact on you, unless you have given us your consent, it is necessary for a contract between you and us or is otherwise permitted by law.
