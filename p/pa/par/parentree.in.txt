To understand this in granular detail, please access the Feedback and Features groups at http://www.parentree.in//, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Any enhanced personal profile information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want Members to know about you. We recommend that you guard your sensitive information and we encourage Members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their enhanced personal profile pages and in the content they post. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.
Service Providers, Business Partners and Others
We will not sell your name, or your email address to anyone.
