Umongous also owns and operates AYTM.com, a market research website where Clients utilize Research data obtained from Users as described below. Users of AYTM.com are subject to the separate Terms of Use and Privacy Policy posted there.
1. What we do:
Umongous is in the market research and opinion research business. Umongous operates the Website for the purpose of gaining anonymous opinions in order to help its Clients gain a better understanding of their business, marketing, product development and strategic opportunities. In order to function as a market research business, we collect your demographic traits (see Section 2 below). We also collect your anonymous self-declared traits (we call these “Trait Surveys”) for the purposes of (i) directing specific surveys to you and (ii) sharing aggregated, anonymous traits associated with answers chosen by the pool of people who answered a survey. Your answers to the questions in the Trait Surveys are used to determine your various social, psychological, political, psychographic and preference attributes as a Member (see below under "Trait Information").
We do not share your name or email address with our Clients. It is a violation of the Terms of Use at AYTM.com for a Client to seek to determine the individual identity of any Member.
If you decide that you do not wish to answer a survey or an individual question in a survey, you can simply end your participation in the survey, and the survey will be cleared from your account, typically in a few hours or days. You will not receive payment for an incomplete survey. See Section 8 below.
2. Information We Collect
2.A. Information We Collect Directly from You
Initial Registration Information: If you wish to become a Member, you must submit your email address and a chosen password. If you choose to register by using a third-party account (such as Google or Facebook), please see Section 2.B below.
Standard Demographic Information: To continue the registration you will be asked to provide what we call "Standard Demographic Information." This may include but will not necessarily be limited to gender, user name, first name, last name, birthdate, country, state/region, county, street address, zip/postal code, time zone, PayPal email address, level of education, relationship status, parental status, employment status, and chosen career. You have the option to also supply your household income and race/ethnicity. In all cases, you know what information we collect from you because you are providing it to us directly.
Telephone Number and PayPal Information: When you register for an account on the Website, and sometimes when you redeem Rewards, you may be required to call us with your landline or cell phone or send us an SMS to provide us with a secret validation code presented to you by us. As a result of this process, we will learn your phone number and will include it in your Membership account. We also request your PayPal account information so we can make payments which may be due to you.
Trait Information: You will receive many short surveys which enable us to learn more about you. We call these “Trait Surveys.” Trait Surveys may seek information about your health and medical conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union memberships, health, psychographic, psychological makeup and sex life, things you have purchased, own or plan to acquire, etc. Your answers to Trait Survey questions are only supplied to Clients in aggregate form, and only to Clients whose surveys you’ve answered. If you do not wish to answer any particular question(s) in a given Trait Survey, you can click the “Exit” button. You will not be remunerated for a Trait Survey which you do not complete.
Umongous Client Survey Information: You may occasionally be given an opportunity to participate in a survey created by a Client, or by Umongous itself. We collect and store the responses that you submit to these surveys. This information may include photos of you, video recordings of you and sharing your screen activity. When a Client created the survey, it is the Client who is responsible for the information and questions included in the survey. It is a violation of the AYTM Terms of Service for a Umongous Client to ask you for personally identifiable information. If a Client survey asks you to provide personal information such as your name, address, phone number, social security number or email address, we urge you not to provide this information. If you see a survey containing such questions, please notify us at privacy [at] PaidViewpoint [dot] com.
If you decide that you do not wish to answer a question or otherwise complete a survey, you can click the “Exit” button to leave the survey. You will not receive remuneration for Client Surveys which you do not complete.
When You Upload an Avatar: You may choose to upload an avatar for use on the Website, which may be your photo or other likeness of you.
When You Communicate with Us: We may learn additional information about you which you choose to share.
When We Verify Your PayPal Account: When your Rewards become vested, and before you are able to redeem them, we ask you to verify your PayPal account. During this process, we will retrieve your PayPal unique ID, your name and country and we store this data on our servers for fraud prevention purposes.
Other Information You Choose to Share: We may collect any other personal information or data if you voluntarily submit it to us.

For more information about how we use cookies, and your choices regarding cookies, please see our Cookie Policy, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
3. How We Use Your Information
To Provide You the Services: We use the information from Trait Surveys to determine whether you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers. This helps us decide whether or not to include you in our Clients’ surveys. We also include questions to identify certain psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. This helps us to better direct surveys to you.
To Invite You to Take a Survey: We may send you an email or SMS message to invite you to take a survey. You may opt out from receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email or selecting the opt-out link on the “Settings” page, and you may opt out from such SMS messages by replying “STOP”. This will not stop other communications from us which may be necessary to provide you the services.
Service-Related Announcements: From time to time we may send you emails related to the services we’re providing to you. You may not opt out from receiving these emails without closing your Member account.
Invitations to Additional Market Research Studies: You may be asked in a survey whether you have interest in participating in additional market research, such as a phone interview, a product test or user experience study. If you elect to be considered for such study, we may contact you so that you can participate. There will be an additional opportunity to opt out of the study at that point.
Marketing and Advertising: We may contact you to offer additional services or promotions directly related to the Website or one of Umongous’ related websites. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in them. This will not stop other communications from us which may be necessary to provide you the services.
To Provide you Support: This includes providing you with technical support and administering your account.
To Maintain, Monitor and improve Our Services: We use usage and other information to help maintain our Website and to analyze how you use the Website and other services, including how you interact with different parts of the Website, and whether you open emails or click on links in them. This enables us to assess the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to determine products that are suitable for you, and to improve our Website and services and your experience with them.
To Maintain the Safety and Security of Our Services: We may use your information for internal purposes designed to keep our services secure and operational, such as for troubleshooting and testing purposes. We may also use your information to verify with a third-party service provider that your email and mailing address correspond to a real individual.
To Prevent Illegal or Abusive Conduct: We use your information as necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, to help prevent illicit or illegal use of the Website or the services, and to screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. In addition, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond to legal requests or subpoenas.
4. How We Share Your Information
Email address and Avatar: We will not rent, sell or share your email address with anyone without your express permission or under the circumstances set forth in the "Law Enforcement" section below. We will not share your avatar with Umongous Clients or associate it with any survey answers. We will share your user name and avatar but not your email address with the User who referred you to us (if any).
Your Survey Responses: We share your survey responses with our Clients whose surveys you answered. The Clients may share these responses with third parties at their discretion. When you answer a research survey we provide the Client your answers, your standard demographic information, and your location down to the zip code level. We do not provide your street address, name, avatar, phone number or email address. We do not share your IP address, but we do let Clients see on a map approximately where you live. Although we do not directly share your identity, there is always a possibility that Clients, and/or other third parties with whom Clients share this information, would be able to deduce your identity, for example if your zip code is sparsely populated and/or if the combination of your demographics and survey answers are very unique. We may also share your survey responses with employees, service providers, and other third parties as described below.
Employees, Service Providers, and Other Third Parties: Our employees may access your complete responses together with any personally identifiable information we collected about you (see above) to the extent necessary to perform their jobs and to service your account.
We also share restricted portions of your information with third parties who help us to provide you with our services including payment processors, hosting services, email service providers, data matching, communications providers, web traffic analytics tools and a web telephony provider to receive the confirmation codes from your phone and identify your phone number to our database (Twilio), and with other third parties who assist us in providing services but are bound by confidentiality agreements. We grant these providers access to limited portions of your information, only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services to us. We also implement reasonable contractual and technical measures to ensure that your personal information is protected, used only for the provision of their services to us, and processed consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We use certain portions of the information that you supplied when you registered to confirm with industry standard third-party service providers that you are who you claim to be. If these services report back to us that you are unlikely to be the identity you claimed, we will not allow you to participate in market research surveys.
Merger, Transactions, Bankruptcy: In the event that Umongous or its affiliates (i) undergoes a corporate restructuring; (ii) enters into a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction pursuant to which Umongous or any portion of its assets or stock is acquired by or assigned to a third party; or (iii) is involved in a bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, liquidation, similar transaction or proceedings, your personal information, including the questions and answers of your surveys and Research participation, may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred and may be shared with third parties, including buyers, service providers or law enforcement officials.
Law Enforcement: We will share your information with law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties (i) if we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; (ii) if we need to do so to comply with law; (iii) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity; (iv) to enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; and/or (v) to defend against legal claims or demands, exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Umongous, our Users or others.
Per Your Express Consent: We may share your information for other reasons or purposes if you provide your permission for us to do so.

6. Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you our services, or as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Even when we delete the information, keep in mind that the deletion by our third-party providers may not be immediate and that the deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to twelve (12) months or as required by legal and/or technical requirements that apply to such third parties. In addition, your survey answers and demographic traits, which have been provided to Clients as part of their survey results, will remain in our databases for as long as such Clients have active accounts or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. This information may also be held by any third party with whom this information had previously been shared.
7. Data Security
Umongous has implemented commercially reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of your personal information under our control. For example, the access to your Member account and the transfer of all personal information collected by us is done over https, we limit access to the information only to individuals who need the information to perform their duties, and we use reliable third-party providers to back up personal information. However, transmission over the internet is not completely secure nor is any type of electronic storage, and there is always a risk that your information may be access or used by authorized third parties.
