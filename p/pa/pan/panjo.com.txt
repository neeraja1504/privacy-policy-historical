Privacy
Online Surveys and Polling
We may provide you with the opportunity to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an authorized third-party. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.
Advertisements on Our Website
We may display advertisements on our Website. By knowing a little about you, we will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content to you in the form of targeted content. We may also use third-party advertising servers to display advertisements linked to certain search terms that you have entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing. We may share aggregated data with advertisers. We may also use advertising partners to assist us in delivering personalized on-line advertisements to you through the use of cookies while you are on the Internet.
Newsletters, Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Advertisements
We may offer newsletters, promotional e-mails, and personalized on-line advertisements as a service to our customers. We may send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current special Listing Items. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails, or personalized on-line advertisements by following any unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail, newsletter, or personalized on-line advertisement you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to support@panjo.com and asking to opt out. Opting out may take up to six weeks to remove you from the database. If you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional emails, or all personalized on-line advertisements, you will not receive future promotional emails, newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable), unless you otherwise subsequently sign up to receive newsletters, emails, or personalized on-line advertisements. Please Note: If you receive e-mails separately from third-party merchants, then all information that you choose to disclose to them will be subject to their privacy policy, terms of use, and opt- out procedures.
Tracking Usage
We may track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, information, and advertisements a customer views while using our Website and what Listing Items they view and/or purchase. We may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Website, and to gather demographic information. We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our Website, sales, and other shopping information with third-parties.
Cookies
We may use cookies and may allow other third-parties to use cookies in the operation of our Website. A cookie is an industry-standard small file placed on your computer. Cookies allow us to "remember you" when you return to the Website to make your visits more relevant and to retrieve information from your prior visits. The cookie stores information about the searches that you have made and the items that you have viewed and allows us and other third-parties to replace non-relevant advertisements with ones that are more relevant to your presumed interests. You may delete cookies on your computer; however, if you enjoy the convenience of the Website remembering you, you are advised not to delete your cookies. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.
Web Beacons
We may use and allow others to use web beacons in the operation of our Website. A web beacon is an industry-standard, often transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed on the Website. Web beacons allow us to track responses or actions by users who view certain advertisements and to count the number of times that users visit the pages of our Website and may be used by both us and third-parties for the purpose of providing personalized media, determining which advertisements are most effective on our Website, and for targeting future advertising campaigns. We may also include web beacons in email messages or promotional newsletters for detecting whether the messages have been opened or if you performed any actions after opening them.
Marketing Partners, Co-Branded Services, and Third-Party Websites
We may run promotions for merchants where you may visit a third-party merchant website. In some of those promotions, a window or frame containing the merchant's website may appear. Any time you are in such a window, you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with that merchant's policies. This Policy does not apply to information that you supply to those merchants. Any information that you share with them will be used and disclosed in accordance with that merchant's privacy policy. However, once you click on a link to return to our Website, you can expect that further information that you disclose will be treated in accordance with this Policy.
Please be aware that our Website may contain links to other websites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third-parties. The information practices of those websites linking from or to our Website are not covered by this Policy. These other websites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies or ad servers, which place advertising on our Website, may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising. You should contact advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.
Security
In order to most efficiently serve you, the purchase of Listing Items utilizing credit card transactions may be handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They may receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order, if applicable.
We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your Personally Identifiable Information. The Website has industry-standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, and we make good faith efforts to store your Personally Identifiable Information in a secure operating environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If we provide you with a user name and password to access portions of the Website, we disclaim any responsibility for a breach of privacy as a result of your willingly or inadvertently disclosing your user name and password to others.
Updating and Correcting Information
We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information on your Panjo Account. We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, your information, even if deleted from a current database, may still exist within an archived database, as we periodically backup information.
Opting Out or Choosing Not to Provide Information
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.
As a condition of creating a User Account and Profile with Panjo, we may on occasion send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity, purchases, as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User's activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of Listing Items.
You may, however, opt out of Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise Listing Items including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at support@panjo.com or by hitting the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our e-mails, or by opting out of Promotional Emails within your User Account.
Acceptance of Terms
By using our Website, you consent to our collection and use of this information in accordance with the terms set forth in this Policy.
