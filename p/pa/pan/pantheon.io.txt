Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Except as instructed by its users (or where required by law), Pantheon will not review, share, distribute, print or reference any Users' Data on the Site or the Services. Pantheon processes Users' Data as a "processor" on behalf of the relevant Users, who are the "controllers" of the Users' Data and instruct its processing in accordance with their own terms and privacy policies.

Third party services: Pantheon may partner with other parties to provide specific services. If a user registers for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.
Service providers: From time to time, we may disclose your personal information to organizations that perform services for Pantheon, for example, to host web sites, provide customer support, and similar services.

Liability
In accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Pantheon remains liable for any processing of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland by third-party agents acting on our behalf where such processing is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Pantheon was not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage.
Data Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with the Service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)
If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, Pantheon Systems, Inc. is the controller of your personal information and our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collected it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to contact you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at privacy@pantheon.io.
