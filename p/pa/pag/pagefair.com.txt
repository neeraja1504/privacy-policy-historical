For the purpose of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (the “Acts” ), the data controller is PageFair Limited a company incorporated in Ireland with company number 530978 whose registered office is at Unit D, Mountpleasant Business Centre, Mountpleasant Avenue, Dublin 6, D06 N925, Ireland.
General Information about Cookies, SessionStorage and LocalStorage
Cookies, SessionStorage and LocalStorage are standardised ways for a website to store a small file of letters and numbers in your browser. These are typically used to remember your preferences, perform security checks, perform analytics, to recognise you as a unique user as you move from one page to another, and to issue you with a secret key when you login that authorises you to access areas of the website that are specific to you or only viewable to logged in users.
By default, it is not possible for one website to access the first-party cookies, LocalStorage or SessionStorage stored by another website, however if two websites make requests to the same third-party web domain, then that third party can store a cookie on the one website and access it on the other (these are known as “third party cookies”). Third party cookies that contain unique values can potentially be used to track you between websites that make requests to the third party.
Cookies are typically automatically deleted when you close your browser, or when their specified expiry date is reached. SessionStorage files are automatically deleted when you close your browser. LocalStorage are deleted when the website that stored them deletes them.  You can also delete cookies and other storage from your browser at any time you like by visiting your web browser settings.
Different web browsers provide varying degrees of control over your browser’s cookies, SessionStorage and LocalStorage.  You can change your browser settings, or if necessary change to a different browser, to automatically prevent 3rd party cookies from being stored. If you are concerned about online tracking you can also change your settings to send a “Do-Not-Track” signal to request websites not to use cookies or other mechanisms to track you, or you can install a browser extension such as Disconnect or Ghostery to block 3rd party tracking cookies on websites.

The PageFair Services
PageFair provides online analysis and advertising services (the “Services” ) to the publishers of various 3rd party websites who have accepted the PageFair Publisher Terms and Conditions. PageFair may process information about the visitors to these 3rd party websites on behalf of the publishers who have contracted with us. PageFair may process the following anonymous information about visitors to websites that make use of the Services. For more details about the use of the Services by a website, please refer to that website’s own privacy policy, or contact that website.
| Information | Purpose | Retention
---|---|---|---
Analytics | We will detect the usage of adblock software, store non-unique information using cookies or LocalStorage, and collect aggregate statistics about this usage for reporting. | To help website publishers understand the usage of adblock software by visitors to their website, and to generate overall market statistics about adblock usage. | Aggregated data may be retained indefinitely.
Advertising | Random first-party user ID, specific to each website. | PageFair stores a unique, random, first-party user ID to enable advertisers to perform frequency capping, so that a given ad is not displayed too often to any one user on a website. A different ID is given on each website, which means this ID cannot be used by PageFair for cross-site tracking. | The user ID is automatically deleted 30 days after it is first created.
Business Intelligence | We may also collect aggregate metrics about visitors’ browsers, devices and onsite behaviour. | To track aggregate statistics about browser technology usage, to create business intelligence for PageFair or for partners, to measure the amount of advertising that is displayed by PageFair on each website. | Aggregated data may be retained indefinitely.
Server-Side Rendering
PageFair Advertising works by performing server-side rendering on 3rd party javascript creatives from advertisers. This means that javascript from unapproved 3rd parties never executes in the web browsers of visitors to websites that use the Services, which effectively prevent the risk of vistors being exposed to malvertising or unauthorised tracking.
User Matching
PageFair may help advertising partners improve the relevance of advertising on websites that make use of the Services by performing user matching. User matching permits an advertising partner to recognise when a random first-party user ID from PageFair corresponds to a user ID (and any associated advertising targeting data) that the partner already holds. PageFair’s user matching functionality is performed in such a way that no information about the URLs that are visited by users is communicated to the advertising partners, and it is automatically deactivated for users who have expressed privacy preferences using Do-Not-Track settings or similar privacy tools, in their web browsers.
PageFair Service Cookies and LocalStorage
When you visit a website that uses the Services, various cookies and LocalStorage files may be stored in your browser. The data that may be stored is described below.
