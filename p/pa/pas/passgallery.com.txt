Sharing of Information and Files
One of the primary reasons people use PASS is to share Files with others. Your personal information may be used to enable you to communicate, collaborate and share Files. When you choose to collaborate or share Files with others, PASS will collect the email addresses and information of the other parties. Some information is retained only as long as necessary to provide requested Services; other information may be retained longer so we may provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements.

PASS is not responsible if you volunteer personal information and Files online that are accessible to all or some of the public. Any personal information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. You may review, update, correct or delete personal information by emailing privacy@passgallery.com and our customer support team will make the changes on your behalf. By submitting such information and Files, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information and Files being displayed. You can control who has access to your Files, but you understand that any shared Files may be re-shared or copied. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your Files. We cannot ensure that Files you share on the Site or through the Services will not become publicly available. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong PASS password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
