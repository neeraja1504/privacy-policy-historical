The Information We Gather from You on our Website
We want to make sure that we provide you with as much information about our products and services as possible, while only asking you for the information we need to provide you with the services you've requested. Currently, we ask that you provide us with the following information:
Catalog Requests
We would love to send you our catalog! In order to do so, we need your name and mailing address. We also ask for your daytime and evening phone numbers and e-mail address in case we need to contact you directly.
Newsletter/Promotional E-mail
We need your e-mail address to keep you instantly aware of our special promotions and latest additions.
Purchasing
We need your name, shipping and billing addresses, daytime phone number and e-mail address to expedite your order. If you select to pay by credit card, we need your credit card number, type of card and expiration date. We ask for your evening phone number as optional information in case we need to contact you directly. We also collect information about the products added to your cart and the orders you place.
Tell A Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's name and email address. PalmBeachjewelry.com will automatically send for a one-time email inviting him/her to visit the site. PalmBeachJewelry.com does not store this information, and it is only used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.
Registration
In order to use this website to its fullest potential, users may complete the registration form. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for users to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.
Surveys
We sometimes conduct online surveys which may ask visitors for contact information and demographic information. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used to monitor or improve the site.
How We Use This Information
Ultimately, our goal is to provide you with a website that's virtually tailor-made to your interests. By keeping records of your purchasing history, we can shape the focus of our website and catalogs to personalize your shopping experience with us and make you instantly aware of products and services that best match your interests.
Your Options Regarding Your Personal Information
If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails, newsletters or promotional information from our company, here are your options:
You can e-mail our customer service department at customerservice@palmbeachjewelry.com.
You may call our Customer Care Center Monday - Friday 8:00am to 11:00pm and Saturday - Sunday 9:00am to 11:00pm Eastern Time at 866-804-3745.
All e-mail promotions sent to you will provide instructions on how to unsubscribe.
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail, or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our services, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by e-mailing our Customer Support service at customerservice@palmbeachjewelry.com
How Secure is our Website?
We have taken every measure possible to ensure that your personal information remains secure. We incorporate the industry-standard SSL encryption for maximum protection. In addition, you will always be informed when you enter a secure area via a "pop-up" message. This message is our way of reassuring you that your credit card transaction is safe. Simply click to continue. When going from a secure area to a non-secure area, another message will appear to let you know that you are leaving the secure area of that site (if your browser preferences are set to allow this).
