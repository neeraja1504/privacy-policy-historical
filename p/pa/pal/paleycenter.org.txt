Other Information We Collect
We and our service providers may collect Other Information such as:
Browser information
Server log files
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
Physical location of your device
Demographic and profile information and other non-personally-identifiable information provided by you
Aggregated information
How We Collect Other Information
We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected through most devices, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, device manufacturer and model, device identifier, screen resolution, and the type and version of your operating system and browser. In addition, an Internet Protocol (IP) address ( i.e. , a number that is automatically assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider) is logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site.
Using cookies: Cookies allow a web server to store data on a user’s device for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, enhance and personalize your online experience and facilitate your ongoing use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all features of the Site may not be available to you.
Analytics: Third-party services, such as Google Analytics, may be used in connection with the Site. Such services use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how visitors use the Site, to compile statistical reports on activity related to the Site, and to provide other services related to the Site. Such services may also collect information about visitors’ use of other websites or other online resources. For more information about Google Analytics, including how to opt out, please go to: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Flash Local Stored Objects: We and our service providers may use a third-party technology, called Flash, in connection with the Site, including our online content. Flash provides a facility, called Local Stored Objects (“LSO”), that allows a website operator or online content provider (or their service providers) to store certain information locally on an individual’s device; for example, Flash LSOs can be used to store information regarding an individual’s device. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.
Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) are small images that may be used by us and our service providers in connection with some pages of the Site and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, render such pages to you on various hardware devices and operating system versions, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage and response rates. Pixel tags may collect information such as the pages, features and links accessed by a user, and the IP address, browser type and operating system of such user’s device.
Physical location: We and our service providers may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, including for marketing purposes, based on the choices that have been made with respect to such uses. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, based on the choices that have been made with respect to such disclosures. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses or sharing of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses or sharing, we, our service providers, and our third-party marketing partners may not be able to provide you with certain personalized services and content.
From you: We and our service providers may collect demographic and profile information such as your city, state or ZIP code of residence, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, your gender and your date of birth, when you voluntarily provide this information to us or our service providers. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
By aggregating information: We and our service providers may aggregate Personal Information collected from you and other users, for example by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users who have a particular telephone area code. Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
How We Use and Disclose Other Information
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your ZIP code with your name). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information while it is so combined.
If you submit any information, including Personal Information, to any third party — for example, via a third-party software application or service, including any social media service, that is included in, available through or linked from the Site — then such third party’s collection, use and disclosure of such information may be governed by its privacy policy, and will not be governed by our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties.
We are not responsible for the information collection, usage, disclosure or other practices of any third parties, including our Affiliates, third-party service providers (including Mobile Roadie), any third-party social media platform (such as Facebook Inc.), any third party making available the devices or operating systems for which the site is available (such as Apple Inc. or Google Inc.) and any third party operating any site to which the Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply that we endorse the linked site.
Third-Party Advertisers
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site or after you leave. We may share information with such companies in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy.  Please note that these companies may use information about your visit to the Site to provide advertisements about goods and services that may interest you. In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your device.

Please note that the Site will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a “Do Not Track” signal or similar mechanism is received from your browser.
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. Unfortunately, no data storage or data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be non-negotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their systems, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.
Please exercise caution in submitting Personal Information through the Site, especially if you are accessing the Site using a WiFi hotspot or public network. If you have reason to believe that your use of the Site is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account that you might have with us has been compromised), please let us know immediately, using the mechanisms described in the “ Contacting Us ” section below.
