SECURITY
Whether you place an order, create a profile or enter into a consultant agreement, we recognize the importance of maintaining the security of our customers' personal information. We use reasonable security measures, including physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to protect your personal information. Here are some examples of security measures we use to protect your personal information:
Passwords are required to access your online account and help to protect your account information. Please keep this password confidential.
Encryption technology, called Transport Layer Security (TLS), helps to protect personal information in certain areas of our websites during transport across the Internet. The presence of TLS encryption may be indicated by https in the browser URL or the image of a closed lock or solid key in the browser window. These indications may not be present in mobile services that use TLS.
For payment card information, we use secured networks, encryption or other protection of cardholder data, physical and technical access controls, monitoring and tests of security systems, and other information security practices to help to protect your information.
In addition, we use commercially reasonable measures to protect the customer data against unauthorized access. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, to the extent required by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our website, and you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for the actions of unaffiliated third parties.

We may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our behalf.

These companies may combine information they learn about your visit to our Website with data about your web activities at third party websites or with demographic information to identify your likely interests so that they can provide you with more useful and relevant advertisements when you visit websites within their networks.

If you would like to obtain more information about the NAI and make choices about their members' use of your information, please visit the NAI website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about interest-based ads from third parties participating in the DAA, please visit the DAA consumer opt out page at  http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
