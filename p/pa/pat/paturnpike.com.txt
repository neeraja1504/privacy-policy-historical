This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
INFORMATION THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE COMMISSION WEBSITE GATHERS AND TRACKS
The PTC Website gathers two types of information about users:
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. This kind of information comes from voluntary submissions such as, to join as a Preferred Traveler, apply for Over-dimensional Permits, submit an online bidder’s mailing list application, email communications or other electronic communications to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, submission of online forms, making payments, requests for traffic reports, submitting employment applications, and from participation in polls and surveys. This information may contain Personally Identifiable Information, and the PTC’s use of such information is described below.
Information the PTC Website gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs. This information is generally not associated with individual users, and will therefore not usually contain Personally Identifiable Information. The PTC's use of such information is described below.
The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
Optional Voluntary Information. Optional voluntary information may include Personally Identifiable Information, which means information that identifies a specific individual including but not limited to an individual's name, street address, email address or phone number. The PTC will protect the personal information submitted through its website to the greatest extent allowed by applicable law. Under no circumstances shall the PTC sell any information gathered through its website for marketing purposes or other purposes. This information may be used by the PTC and its consultants for public outreach and informational purposes, unless an individual specifically requests that we do not.
The PTC offers the following services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
Preferred Traveler. The Pennsylvania Turnpike offers a free traveler-notification program to any interested traveler. The PTC gathers the names and email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Subscribers may optionally provide mailing addresses and/or telephone numbers. Users may remove themselves from this program by following the instructions on the Preferred Traveler account management page.
Email and Online Forms. Users may email, or submit online request forms to the PTC through our website with questions about their E-ZPass accounts, construction activity, and any other questions they may have about the PTC’s operations. Email and form requests may be shared with appropriate personnel within the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and other entities in order to respond to the request and may be maintained in order to keep track of user feedback. Form data may be stored to provide on-going service to the user.
Over-Dimensional Permits. Due to safety considerations, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission requires special permits for over dimensional vehicles. There are also restrictions as to the time of day the vehicles may travel as well as holiday restrictions. The issuance of Over-Dimensional permits is automated through the PA Turnpike’s website, and requires the input of the organization’s contact information, as well as the load specifications.
In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.
Aggregated Usage Information. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. Reports based on this information are for internal use only. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. We may collect some or all of the information listed below about users who view or download information from our website:

Cookies. The PTC’s web site may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personally Identifiable Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only Personally Identifiable Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The PTC uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.
