What is Spare the Air Program?
The Spare the Air Program was established by the The Bay Area Air Quality Management District in 1991 to reduce air pollution and provide advance notice when a "Spare the Air Alert" is in effect. The Air District declares Spare the Air Alerts on days when air quality is forecast to exceed federal standards.
