The mandatory or optional nature of the data is specified on each occasion - with reference to the individual information requested - at the time of the individual data collection, by adding a specific character (*) to information of a mandatory nature. Any refusal to communicate to Tessilform some of your data marked as mandatory makes it impossible to pursue the main purpose of the specific collection: such refusal could for example make it impossible for Tessilform to fulfil the contract for the purchase of products on patriziapepe.com or to provide the other services available on the patriziapepe.com website. The supply to Tessilform of additional data other than those marked as essential is optional and does not prevent the main purpose of the collection be pursued (e.g., as applicable, the use of the website and its services or the purchase of products).
