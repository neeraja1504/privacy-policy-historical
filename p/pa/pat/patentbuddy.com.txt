Personal Information.
The purpose of the PatentBuddy website is to permit Users to voluntarily provide information about themselves for the purposes of developing, maintaining and enhancing a network of professional contacts. You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the PatentBuddy website. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the PatentBuddy website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you should not become a member of the PatentBuddy community.
We collect your personal information in the following ways:
Registration.
In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our website. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including PatentBuddy, to identify you: name, email address, name of the organization that you are associated with, and a password chosen by you.
Profile Information.
Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and awards/recognitions. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the PatentBuddy system to build and leverage your professional network. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information that is not personally identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service. If you opt-out you may lose the potential benefit of being a User, including receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests.
Customer Service.
PatentBuddy may collect information through the PatentBuddy website or through the Customer Service in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to a customer's inquiry and deliver appropriate service levels.
Cookies.
Like most websites, PatentBuddy uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows PatentBuddy to recognize you as a User when you return to the PatentBuddy website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the PatentBuddy website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our website.
One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your PatentBuddy account. The next time you visit the PatentBuddy website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
Additionally, if you log out of the PatentBuddy website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the PatentBuddy website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information about your professional or educational background, for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the PatentBuddy website or services effectively. PatentBuddy does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.
Web Beacons.
We allow other Patent Owners, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. PatentBuddy may "target" some ads to Users that fit a certain general profile - for example, "product managers in Texas". PatentBuddy does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.
To deliver these ads properly, PatentBuddy may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by PatentBuddy so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these Patent Owners can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. PatentBuddy does not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party.
Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the PatentBuddy web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave PatentBuddy. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the PatentBuddy service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
Consent to PatentBuddy Processing Information About You.
Certain information you provide to PatentBuddy may reveal, or allow others to identify more about you. Please be aware that in providing information to PatentBuddy for the purposes of opening your user account, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and PatentBuddy's User Agreement. The supplying of all such information by you to PatentBuddy, including all information deemed "sensitive" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.
Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You.
You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein.
We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at support@patentbuddy.com
