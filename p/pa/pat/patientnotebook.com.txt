Last Modified: Jan. 30, 2016
The privacy of your personal health and financial information is paramount. This privacy policy describes how ZirMed Inc. (variously, "ZirMed", we, our or us) protects and handles the personal information that you or your healthcare provider furnishes to ZirMed. We obtain your information through our web-based service at https://www.patientnotebook.com and related web sites ("Patient Notebook").
1. Introduction
Patient Notebook is bringing together the latest technology and medical information to make managing your healthcare expenses and information much easier. With Patient Notebook, you can: (1) pay your medical bills quickly, easily and securely; (2) store and manage all types of healthcare communications in one central place; (3) and access other online health tools. The availability of these tools will vary based on which components of Patient Notebook your healthcare provider chooses to make available to you.
Each person's information is stored and accessed separately in his or her own Patient Notebook account.
2. Creating an Account and Records: Collection of Your Personal Information
You choose whether or not to create an account with Patient Notebook.  Creating an account is not necessary to submit payments.  Your healthcare provider controls your ability to create a Patient Notebook account, and some providers may elect not to make this functionality available. If you do not choose to create an account, or your healthcare provider does not allow you to create one, you will only be allowed to: (a) send your healthcare provider an update to your mailing address; (b) send your healthcare provider an update to your insurance information; (c) request that your physician's office call you; (d) access limited information about current balances due to, and statements from, your provider; (e) make an online payment. Your ability to conduct these actions will be determined by which components of Patient Notebook your healthcare provider chooses to make available to you.
The first time you sign in to Patient Notebook, you will be asked to create your username and password. To do so, you must provide personal information, such as your email address, name, and date of birth. We will use the email address you provide to send you an email requesting that you validate your account.
You can review and update your account information. You can also modify, add, or delete any optional information by signing into your Patient Notebook account and editing your account profile.
An account allows you to manage your health and wellness bills and utilize the tools offered on Patient Notebook. Once you have an account, you can view, store, and pay health bills for yourself and dependents (to the extent you have the right to do so and if your healthcare provider has elected to make such functionality available).
When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.
Saving payment methods within Patient Notebook makes those credit/debit cards and checking/savings accounts available for your future use within Patient Notebook. These payment methods are available solely for use by you and any persons you grant access to your Patient Notebook accounts (to the extent such functionality is made available). Your healthcare provider cannot use the payment methods stored in Patient Notebook. Your healthcare provider may be aware of general details about the method you used to make a payment.
3. Account and Record Access and Controls
You are the custodian of any records you create or your healthcare provider sends to your account.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of Patient Notebook users or members of the public.

Throughout Patient Notebook, you might be provided with information about other service providers or healthcare providers (such as NoMoreClipboard) that connect with Patient Notebook.
