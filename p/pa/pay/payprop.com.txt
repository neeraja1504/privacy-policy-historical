Privacy Policy | PayProp
We ("Humanstate") operate several websites including payprop.com. It is Humanstate's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Humanstate collects non-personally identifiable information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Humanstate's purpose in collecting non-personally identifiable information is to better understand how Humanstate's visitors use its website. From time to time, Humanstate may release non-personally identifiable information in aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on website usage trends.
Humanstate also collects potentially personally identifiable information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Humanstate does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifiable information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally Identifiable Information
Certain visitors to Humanstate's websites choose to interact with Humanstate in ways that require Humanstate to gather personally identifiable information. The amount and type of information that Humanstate gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our services to provide a username and email address.
Those who engage in transactions with Humanstate are asked to provide additional information, including the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Humanstate collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Humanstate. Humanstate does not disclose personally identifiable information other than as described below.
Visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifiable information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section ยง 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us via the Contact Us link.
Aggregated Statistics
Humanstate may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular service accounts on the Humanstate site. Humanstate may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Humanstate does not disclose personally identifiable information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally Identifiable Information
Humanstate discloses potentially personally identifiable information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that:
need to know that information in order to process it on Humanstate's behalf or to provide services available at Humanstate's websites, and
have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. By using Humanstate's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Humanstate will not rent or sell personally identifiable or potentially personally identifiable information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Humanstate discloses personally identifiable and potentially personally identifiable information only when required to do so by law, or when Humanstate believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Humanstate, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of a Humanstate website and have supplied your email address, Humanstate may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or provide updates on Humanstate and our services.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to it, or to help us support other users.
Humanstate takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
