This Online Privacy Policy covers use of the site www.paybooks.in, www.ess.paybooks.in and www.demo.paybooks.in.
All information disclosed by visitors is subject to this Privacy Policy. With respect to data received through its websites, Paybooks will comply with the following:
1.   TYPES AND USES OF INFORMATION
1.1. Paybooks gathers personal information from site visitors from time to time in order to enhance existing offerings or provide additional services. The company gathers only the information essential for understanding visitors in such a way as to provide better payroll products and employee benefit services. This may include contact information such as name, email address, telephone number, and company name, and perhaps other data.
1.2. Paybooks also may monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help refine and improve the design and layout of the website as well as the user experience. As a result, Paybooks automatically tracks certain information about site visitors. This information includes the users’ browser type, most recent URL and the next URL that the user visits, regardless of whether these URLs are on the Paybooks website or not. Paybooks also will track visitors’ IP addresses. Paybooks uses this information to, among other things, identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to users’ interests.

1.4. Paybooks does not collect e-mail addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this information (typically via our online information or demo request form, whitepaper request form, and other website forms and surveys). Paybooks will periodically use that contact information to send visitors e-mail or other communications for sales, service, support and marketing purposes. Visitors who do not wish to receive marketing e-mail from Paybooks in the future may opt out of receiving these communications by following the instructions included in each communication.
