Privacy Policy | PayScale
Here at PayScale, Inc. ("PayScale," "we," "our," or "us") we care about being transparent with our visitors and users. Effective as of May 25, 2018, we have updated our Privacy Policy to clarify (in plain English and with a lot of bullets) what information we collect and how we use that information when you visit our Websites (defined herein) and use our products or services (collectively, "Services"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Website" collectively refers to payscale.com and other websites that we operate or that link to this Privacy Policy. The previous version of this Privacy Policy can be found here.
We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, "Privacy Shield") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively. To learn about how we comply with the Privacy Shield principles, go here. You can learn more about Privacy Shield and view our certification here.
Why and how do we collect information?
Our main purpose for collecting data is to provide you the Website, Services, and features that best meet your compensation information and management needs. We collect information through various ways. Below are the most common circumstances of how we collect information:
Signing up for a PayScale account: If you sign-up for a PayScale account, we will ask for your email address and to create a password. After you create a PayScale account and log-in to our Services, you are no longer anonymous to us.
Completing a salary survey: If you complete a survey, we will ask for detailed job and compensation information that's used to generate your customized salary report and certain portions of that data will be included in our anonymous and aggregated salary database called Crowdsourced Data. You can choose to take a survey anonymously.
Browsing our website: We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, PayScale cookie information, and the page you requested.
Requesting a demo: If you request a demo from us, you will be asked to provide us your contact information and relevant information about your business, so we can contact you for scheduling and demo to you the appropriate Service based on your business structure and needs. That information is stored in our internal systems to allow us to manage our relationship with you.
From businesses that buy our services: We may receive data such as names, job title, and salary information from your employer if your employer has purchased our compensation management Services for businesses. If your employer is a PayScale customer, you can learn from your employer about what information it shares with us, which will vary based on the Service.
