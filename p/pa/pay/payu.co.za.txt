Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" so that we can better serve you with more tailored information when you return to our site. "Cookies" are used to enhance your interactive experience and generally improve our service to you. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
We store information you supply in personalizing your use of our services.
We protect subscriber information from outside parties by storing it in a fully-secured database.
You may update personal information at any time by using the personalize function.
You acknowledge, that in the interests of improving personalization and service efficiency, we may, under controlled and secure circumstances, share your personal information with some of our affiliate companies who provide content to this portal.
In all other cases, the only information we will ever disclose to third parties (e.g.: advertisers) is aggregate information about our users.
Aggregate information will never identify you. It only identifies the user population in general terms. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of sites linking out of the "The operator/Safikatel/Internet Solutions" network.
