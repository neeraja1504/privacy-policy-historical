We may share non-personally identifiable information collected via the program in aggregate (or grouped), anonymous form with advertisers or other third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments of our member base, but we do not disclose your personally identifiable information to these third parties without your consent.
Anti-Spam Policy:
Because email is an integral part of the program, your sharing of email contact with us allows us to share the program information, offers and promotions via email with you. If you later decide you wish to cease participation in this portion of the program, you may do so at any time by unsubscribing to our communication. Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative emails that include but are not limited to, notices about vital program and membership status changes or alterations to our terms of service or any other service requests, redemption orders placed with us.
Automatically Collected Information
When you log on to the PAYBACK Website or use the PAYBACK Card at a PAYBACK Partner, the server automatically recognizes you by your encrypted member id. This id acts as a unique identifier, which allows us to recognize you and authorize your transactions. It also allows us to keep track of your activity on our site for crediting points to your account. If you choose, this information may be added to your personal profile and used to target you with offers and advertisements that are most relevant to your interests.
Data Verification and Supplementation:
Data verification involves the use of third-party data processing services to standardize and clean your provided enrolment information so that it is easily identified and accessed in our database. Data supplementation involves appending any publicly available information about you to your personal profile. Guarding your own information: We recommend that you take the following precautions to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information:
Never provide personal information that can be used to access your account over the phone unless you have initiated the call and know with whom you are speaking; update any changes in addresses immediately through the proper channel; report lost or stolen cards immediately.
Security of the information
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect customer information. Specific employees are authorized to access customer information on a need to know basis for business purposes only. Our employees are bound by code of ethics that requires confidential treatment of customer information and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to follow this code.
Making sure the information is accurate:
It is in your interest and it is our objective, to have accurate, current and complete information concerning you and your account. We have strict procedures that our employees abide by to meet this objective. While some procedures are required by Central, State or RBI regulations, we have implemented additional procedures to maintain accurate, correct and complete financial information, including processes to update information and remove outdated information.
