GETTING STARTED
ABG wants you to feel comfortable about giving us access to your personal information. Use this Privacy Notice to find out what happens to your personal information when you interact with ABG and what choices you have. This Privacy Notice does not apply to our independent licensee locations. Please review the privacy notices of our independent licensees for information on how they use personal information that you provide to them.
This Privacy Notice covers the personal information the ABG companies collect, use and disclose through your use of our products and services either online or offline
ABG needs to collect personal information from you to rent a vehicle or provide our other services. We collect personal information when you give it to us, such as by telephone, fax, postal mail, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of one of ABG's website or mobile Apps or the use of our products and services.
Sometimes, we may combine your personal information with other information we received from other sources so we can provide you a more customized and hassle-free experience. We may obtain personal information about you from a third party, such as through a travel agent, an account program connected with your employer or association. Additionally, our affiliates and third parties may provide us with information about you
We may also automatically collect technical information about your devices when you use our website and App. To learn about our online data collection, go to the Online Data section.
Any disputes regarding how we handle your personal information will be governed by the terms of your vehicle rental or the terms of use of our website or App, unless otherwise required by applicable law. This may include mandatory arbitration of disputes.
RENTING A VEHICLE
When you make a reservation, rent a vehicle or join one of our programs, we collect personal information from you, such as:
name;
email address;
home and/or business address;
telephone numbers at which we can reach you;
date of birth;
payment information such as your credit or debit card details (security code is obtained for transaction only - we do not keep it);
information from driver's license and/or other government issued identification;
special discount codes, partner member numbers, association memberships (for discounts, special privileges and points programs); and
other information that may be required to rent you a vehicle and/or provide you with services.
We may also collect demographic information about you such as your age, gender, habits or preferences, where you rented the vehicle, were any special needs or equipment requested, whether you are part of a corporate or rewards program, where and when you returned the vehicle, customer service inquiries or complaints, payment arrangements, insurance preferences, gas consumption, mileage, accident history and other information related to the vehicle and your use of it. We use this information to administer your rental and also to better understand our customers and provide you with relevant offers.
Some vehicles come equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) or similar type tracking device that may also collect information about the vehicle. To learn about vehicle data we collect, scroll down to read about Vehicle Data.
We use all this information to provide you with our great services (for example, renting a vehicle and providing discounts and offers) and for our business purposes (research and development of new products and services and enforcing our legal rights).
One more thing: when you call us (from any phone), we may record or monitor the call for qualify control, training or similar purposes.
VEHICLE DATA
Some vehicles you rent from ABG may be equipped with devices which allow us to send commands to and receive certain information from the vehicle, including geolocation data from a global positioning system (GPS). These devices are turned on all the time, even when other services or other media in the vehicle is turned off. ABG and its partners may collect and process vehicle data about the vehicle itself, such as fuel level, odometer, speed, diagnostic and performance data, tire pressure, accident or damage data, and location and direction of travel data. This information assists us in providing our services (such as responding to unlocking door requests, remote start and stop and our unattended vehicle pick-up and return), software updates, product support, locating and responding to accidents, identifying reported lost, not returned, suspected of being stolen and stolen vehicles and as may be requested by law enforcement agencies. We may also use this information to determine certain fees to be charged in connection with our services.
This data also helps us understand vehicle or driver related behavior such as traffic patterns, fuel efficiency, driving behavior, vehicle usage, environmental impacts and vehicle maintenance improvement. We may share vehicle data with third parties who assist us in providing and improving our services and with law enforcement agencies and others to protect our rights or to enforce the terms and conditions of our services. To learn about how we share the data we collect, scroll down to Information Sharing.
Services such as OnStar or other similar manufacturer provided features, which may be included in your rental, may collect vehicle data as well. We encourage you to go check out their privacy practices.
PHOTOS& VIDEO
ABG may collect photos and videos in some instances, such as when you link your ABG account with your social media profile. ABG rental locations are also equipped with video security surveillance systems as well as cameras that record as our vehicles depart/enter our lots.
ONLINE DATA
When you download, visit and use our websites and/or Apps, ABG automatically collects technical information. This section tells you more about what technical information we collect and why we collect it.
IP Addresses : We may collect your IP address when you visit our websites to help us diagnose problems with our main computers, for system administration, to report aggregated information to our business partners, and to audit the use of our website. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. In select circumstances, we may use IP addresses to help us identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our website terms of use or to protect our service, site, users or others.
Cookies & other similar technologies: We use cookies, scripts, pixel tags, etags, web beacons and other similar technologies to help us recognize you, remember your previous rentals, your travel preferences, etc., so you don't have to tell us over and over again! This helps us make the website more convenient and efficient. We also use these technologies to track website usage trends and patterns, personalize features, and tailor advertisements to you and provide you with a personalized marketing experience. We share website usage information about visitors with selected third parties for the purpose of targeting our Internet advertisements on our websites and other websites that display our advertisements. You can control your cookies and other technology preferences by going to your browser settings and tools. To learn more about our interest-based online marketing programs, read the sections below on Online Advertising and Your Choices.
Mobile Analytics : When you download and use our Avis, Budget or Payless Car Rental Apps, we use mobile analytics software to help us better understand the functionality of our App on your mobile device. Our analytics may record how often you use the App, how you use the App, aggregated usage, performance data and where you downloaded the App from. We do not link the analytic information to any personal information you submit while using the App. Scroll down to read more about how we use information for research under Analytics.
Mobile GPS and Push Notifications : If you let us, we may collect location markers using the GPS in your device or WIFI routers. Knowing approximately where you are helps the App provide you better service, such as finding the nearest Avis, Budget or Payless rental location near you. This also helps us send you push notifications or other communications based on your location (for example, nearby special offers) and for providing certain services such as arrival and return notifications, providing information about vehicle location, available upgrades, etc. If you change your mind about sharing your location or receiving push notifications from the App, adjust the settings of your mobile device to turn off transmission of geolocation data or to stop transmission of push notifications at any time. Just remember if you do turn these features off, you will not receive information tailored to your location or special locations-based offers.

INDEPENDENT LOCATIONS
Did you know that many Avis, Budget or Payless locations are independently owned and operated? Each of these locations collects, uses and discloses personal information for its own purposes. ABG does not control the independent licensee's or franchisee's use of this personal information. Please ask to review the privacy notice for that location.
When you are dealing with an independent location, the licensee or franchisee is responsible for collecting and processing payment and may engage in its own email campaigns and other forms of marketing to you. ABG is not responsible for the compliance of the independent location with privacy laws. However, if you believe the independent location is violating privacy laws, you may report this to ABG's Privacy Officer at ABGprivacy@avisbudget.com.
