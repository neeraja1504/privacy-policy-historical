Privacy Policy
This Policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, products, and content ("Services").
We value your privacy a lot. When you share information with us through the use of one of our Services, we make sure it is stored as securely as possible, and kept only for the purpose intended.
As such, we never share the information you provide to third parties, except for chosen partners that are used for the purpose of providing you the best Paper.li experience.
You always remain in control of your data. You may edit or erase your data from our Services at any time.
When we refer to "we" or "us" in this policy, we mean Finity SA, which controls the information collected when you use the services (including but not limited to Finity.ai, Paper.li, ...). This Policy does not apply to information collected by third-party Web sites linked to or otherwise accessible from Paper.li. The information collected or received by third-party services is subject to their own privacy policies.
How do we use the information we collect?
The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of operating and improving our Services.
When you visit one of our services, we collect usage information, log data and remarketing data.
We use usage information and log data to compute non-identifying reports that are used to improve our services. For that purpose, non-identifying usage information and log data are also shared with our third-party analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and HubSpot).
Log data may also be used to fight spam and other abuse of our services.
We use remarketing data to measure the conversion of marketing campaigns we sometimes do on external platforms like Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter, as well as present users who have visited our services relevant ads. Remarketing data is collected through the usage of tracking pixels. No personal information is contained in or collected as a result of using these tracking pixels.
Some Paper.li papers may include ads served by Google Ads. Google uses cookies to help serve personalized ads, as expressed within the Cookies section. More information can be found into Google Advertising Privacy & Terms document.

From time to time, we use your email exclusively to send you information about new features of Paper.li, best practices and Paper.li discounts. You can decide to opt out of these Paper.li marketing and product update communications at any time within your Paper.li account settings page under the Email notifications section.
We may also contact you to inform you about changes to our Paper.li Service and important Service-related notices, such as new Terms or other security notices. These communications are considered part of the Service and you may not opt out of them.
Your name and email address may be securely transmitted to our third parties (including, but not limited to, customer.io). We use those third-party tools as communication tools with you.
