2.1 Paperform is used by "Visitors", "Customers" and "Respondents." For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Visitors are any persons who visit our Website, Customers are persons that create forms and Respondents are persons who answer or respond to those forms. In relation to the personal information of Customers, Paperform acts as a data controller for the purposes of the GDPR, as we determine the means and purposes of processing of that personal information. Where we process the personal information of Respondents, Paperform mostly acts as a data processor for the purposes of the GDPR, as we only process that personal information on behalf of the Customer and as instructed by the Customer. However, we may still gather certain types of information on Respondents in order to provide our Website and Services (as defined in the General Terms and Conditions of Use).
For the purposes of the GDPR, you acknowledge that by providing your personal information to us, either as a Visitor, Customer or as a Respondent, that the collection of such personal information takes place outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") and that it is necessary for the provision of the Services to Process such personal information outside the EEA and that such personal information may then be stored on servers in the United States. In relation to the collection of such personal information you acknowledge that both these scenarios do not constitute a "transfer" of personal information from within the EEA to outside the EEA by us.
Paperform will, from time to time, receive and store personal information entered onto our Website, provided to us directly or given to us in other forms. We may also collect information you provide while interacting with us. Paperform collects personal information from you in a variety of ways, including when you interact with us electronically or in person, when you access our website and when we provide our services to you. We may also receive personal information from third parties. If we do, we will protect it as set out in this Privacy Policy.
2.2 Visitors

(d) Aggregated and other pseudonymous data about Visitors through the use of cookies, page tags and other tracking services.
On the basis of fulfilling our legitimate interests in being able to respond to your questions, we may process such personal information as your name, email address, and/or other contact information. If we did not process your personal information in this manner, we would be unable to receive or provide answers to your questions.
2.3 Customers
On the basis of fulfilling our contract with you, or the preparatory steps in relation to such contract, we may process such personal information as your name, phone number, address, email address, and/or financial or credit card information to enable us to send information, provide updates and process your product or service order. If we did not process your personal information in this manner, we would be unable to provide you with our products and services.

You may revoke your consent at any time by contacting us, as provided below. Revoking your consent will prevent us from processing your information for the purposes in which we sought consent, but will not affect any other processing of information or the other services we provide to you. Revoking your consent will also not affect the lawfulness of our processing of your personal information for the period before you withdrew your consent.
2.4 Respondents
Respondents, when completing a form, may divulge personal information or data. Paperform is not responsible for the content of the Customer's form, and all processing of Respondents' personal information will be subject to the Customer's own privacy policy.
The Customer is responsible for and manages the processing of data collected from the forms it creates and all Respondents and/or Customers who divulge personal information of third parties are solely responsible for obtaining the consent (if required) and notifying such third parties before divulging their personal information to us. Please contact the Customer directly if you have any questions about the form created by the Customer or the Customer's privacy policy.
While we mostly process personal information on behalf of the Customer, we may still gather certain types of information on Respondents in order to provide our Services. The information we collect includes:
the information Respondent enters into a form, before the Respondent completes or submits the form in order to prevent the inadvertent loss of Respondent's response; and
Respondent's e-mail address if the Customer provides it to us to send the Respondent an invitation to complete a form by e-mail.

We collect and store this information from Respondents to fulfill both our contract with the Consumer and our legitimate business interests in the proper delivery of our products and Services.

5. Disclosure of your personal information
5.1 Paperform may disclose your personal information to any of our employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers, analytics and email service providers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary to perform the tasks we request of them and they are not authorized by us to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.. Personal information is supplied to a third party when it is required for the delivery of our services. Certain service providers will use the personal information we provide them to determine your social media account information and ascertain your approximate geographic location.
Some of your personal information may be used for marketing purposes, including being shared with advertising platforms for the purposes of identifying current or potential Customers.
We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.

5.5 By providing us with personal information, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the types of disclosure covered by this Privacy Policy.
6. International transfer of your information
6.1 Paperform is domiciled in Australia and therefore, your personal information may be accessed by staff or other persons in, transferred to, and/or stored at, countries located outside the EEA in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. Furthermore, information that we collect may from time to time be stored, processed in or transferred between parties located in countries outside of Australia. These countries may include, but are not limited to Australia, Singapore, and the United States of America. When you create a form or submit information on a form you consent to such transfer of information to these locations.
6.2 Where we transfer personal information from inside the EEA to outside the EEA, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant personal information. Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.
7. Security of your personal data
7.1 Paperform is committed to ensuring that the information you provide to us is secure and will implement technical and organisational measures to do so. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure information and protect it from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorized access, modification and disclosure.
7.2 The transmission and exchange of information is carried out at your own risk. We cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to us, or receive from us, over the Internet. Once we have received your personal information, we will take measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information.
8. How long we retain your personal information
8.1 Paperform will not hold your personal information for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained, unless it is otherwise necessary to hold your personal information to meet our legal requirements, as discussed above. For example, we may retain certain personal information to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. We shall periodically review and delete/erase personal information that we hold. .
