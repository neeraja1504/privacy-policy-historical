Right to access and data portability
Users have the right to access which data we hold about them by contacting us . We will also request you to verify your identity to make sure that we give the information to the correct person.

You have the right to delete your personal information from our systems. Some data will be retained for a while even after you have deleted your personal information for security and legal reasons. An example of this would be to comply with a law investigation where we have to provide certain data.

We pledge to protect your personal data as best as we possibly can, however as with everything on the internet, nothing is 100% safe.
