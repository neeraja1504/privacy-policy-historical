7.3 We share your personal data within our group of companies and many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The third parties service providers processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria, see description in section 7.4.
7.4 Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certificate mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw your personal data out of the EEA. Please email us at info@pixpro.net if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
