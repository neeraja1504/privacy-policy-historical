1. With your consent: We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Per our agreement with the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), we must add valid contact information to the Whois directory for each domain name and IP you register. It is possible to purchase Private Registration by requesting it from your salesperson at the time of your order. By using private registration you can hide your personal contact information and display proxy information instead. Private Registration is available for many domain name extensions. However, some registries do not allow it.
WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITE
Pixafy may gather information from your web visit (as detailed below) to be analyzed in connection with providing the best products and services for our clients. This information helps us to customize products and content as well as developing an efficient browsing experience with regard to our site and the products/information contained therein. Thus, we may track visitor IP addresses as well as utilize unique alphanumeric identifiers (as detailed below) and web beacons (as detailed below) upon visits. This helps diagnose problems with our servers, administer our Websites, recognize details of visits (including, but not limited to, unique visits and sources of visits), tailor web content to users, avoid users viewing repeat content, improve our web structure and to analyze the effectiveness of our content. Specifically excluded is the collection of personal information from visitors so long as it does not pertain to public computer details or information disclosed by users via live and email communication with our site.
Pixafy users are informed that we may archive information provided to us via live communication (calls, visits, any other real-time communication) as well as information submitted in writing (web forms, order processing, email) to verify customer identities and provide our users with the best possible product as well as the most efficient user experience possible. Telephone calls may also be recorded for training purposes. Information submitted via the above methods may be combined with statistics gathered from web visits to measure interest in or develop our web pages and marketing plans, customize the content you view on your web visits based on your activity on past visits, develop generalized customer/consumer profiles, and administer our website.
What is a “visit”? There are a number of methods of approach to Pixafy’s website that are considered a “visit.” These include utilizing a web browser that delivers you to www.pixafy.com or any other site for which the previous URL’s can be considered a “root” to, as well as any other sites that are owned by, Pixafy. This may also include viewing an email that has content delivered from one of our servers (or a third party web server), or by viewing an advertisement displayed on a third party website that has content delivered by one of our web servers.
When web visits occur, our server may log the time/duration of your visit as well as the pages you visited and the time/duration spent on them. If your arrival results from a sponsored link, paid advertisement or paid search result, statistics may be gathered from your visit. In any other event, information may also be gathered based on where your visit originated as well as public computer data, visible to the analysis in place.
What is an “alphanumeric identifier”?During your visit, a unique alphanumeric identifier may be placed on your hard drive to help us identify visitors for customization and analysis. These identifiers may also be known as “cookies” and cannot be executed as code, used to deliver a virus, be identifiable to other servers, nor can any personal information be gathered by them. Pixafy utilizes this method solely for the aggregation of statistics used to enhance the product we offer users. If you do not want these identifiers placed upon your visit, cookies can be disabled in your web browser in the security settings that control them. It is important to note, however, that disabling cookies may hinder your ability to utilize our website at its intended performance level or to execute some functions contained in which cookies are required for security purposes.
What is a “web beacon”? A web beacon is a small graphic that may be embedded into Pixafy advertisements, emails or web pages. This small graphic will result in your web browser requesting the beacon from a web server. This request results in your web browser acquiring a unique identifier that may track visitor movement on the website utilizing the web beacon. Pixafy uses web beacons to provide customized offers and gain usage statistics that help tailor the most desired viewing experience for the majority of our visitors. Other than raw usage statistics, no personal information is gleaned by Pixafy’s web beacons.
