1. Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally
identifiable information may be requested.
2. The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the PixelPeeper website. The types of personal
information collected are:
Email address
Country
and optionally:
Flickr user name
Name or nickname
URLs of personal site / facebook profile
3. The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself to make your PixelPeeper profile more complete (e.g. showing your most popular photos next to your name)
and for some functions which require knowing your flickr account (classified ads, listing of your flickr photos indexed by PixelPeeper).
We never share this information with outside parties.
We use the email address to send you important information related to your PixelPeeper account
(such as when you forget a password and want a new password to be generated). Such addresses are not
used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to use advanced functions of the service
(classified ads, owned equipment, equipment on your wish list, writing articles).
We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design and promote our website but we would
not disclose anything that could be used to identify any individual.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
4. Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have
put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.
5. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never
collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and
no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
6. How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain
by logging into your account and going to the My PP page. We use this procedure to better
safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us
a request that credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before granting access or making corrections.
