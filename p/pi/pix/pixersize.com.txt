This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve the Users of Services provided by Pixers LTD (“ We ”) on the pixers.us website, who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is used online. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. BY USING ANY PORTION OF OUR SERVICE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM USERS OF OUR SERVICES?
The types of information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any information that does not reveal your identity. The following sections describe how your PII and non-PII are collected by us, and how we use such information. The above information may be associated with you, if you choose to give us personal data about yourself as described in the Terms of Service and if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of legal action, some third parties such as your Internet provider could match our anonymous technical information with you, using information beyond what is found on our servers.
We may also use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your computer, and we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
