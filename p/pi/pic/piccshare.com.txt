When you use the PiccShare Software Application, you will see advertisements that are periodically updated. These advertisement messages typically come from third-party advertisement servers or advertisement networks.
Some of these advertising networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement message. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by an online server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by an online server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
