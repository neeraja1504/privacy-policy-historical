Privacy Policy
Contact Picatic at 1-866-300-2666 if you have any questions at all.
Picatic E-Ticket Inc. (“Picatic”, “we”, “our”) are committed to protecting your privacy. We make the website, www.picatic.com (the “ Website ”) available together with the custom event creation and event fundraising services offered through the Website as further described in our Terms of Service (collectively the “ Services ”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about users and Services.
Consent: By using the Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell customer lists. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Services or certain features of the Services (for example, registration is required to create an event or contribute to it but browsing existing events on the Website does not require registration).
Collection of Information: We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement and management. We will only use information for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.
Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).
“Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or be able to access and use the Website at all. In other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration processes; communications with you; information downloads; service use; service purchases; user support; and surveys.
“Non-Personal Information” is information of an anonymous nature, such as the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the Website. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.
Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Such Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.
Use of Information: We collect information for the following purposes:
Registration: In order to register for our Services you must provide certain Personal Information to us such as your full name, address, email address, username, Facebook account, Twitter account, LinkedIn, and/or Google+ account. In general, none of your account registration information will be shared with any other users of the Website or our Services. When you sign up for the Services using your Facebook, Twitter and/or Google+ account, Facebook, Twitter and/or Google+ will share certain information with us such as your username, photo (if provided), and contact list. Your username and photo (if provided) will be visible to others if you make your profile public.
Event Ticket Purchases: If you purchase tickets for events using Picatic’s payment processor, Picatic will collect your credit card information at the time of payment. If you purchase tickets for an event that has a public list of attendees, your name and social media account which you used to register for the Services will be made public on the attendee list.
Transactional Notifications: We also provide notifications relating to your use of our Services, despite your indicated e-mail preferences, for example we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.

You may withdraw your consent to receiving marketing communications from us at any time by following the opt-out instructions in each communication, or by contacting us.
Statistics: We also collect statistics about use of the Services purchased through the Website. This information will be kept confidential, however, aggregate statistics that do not personally identify an individual will be kept by us and such aggregate statistics may be made available to other members or third parties.
System Logs & Cookies: Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website.

We do not link any of the information we use in cookies to any personally identifiable information submitted by you when you are on the Website.

These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers.
