Email Address Privacy :
PictureTrail will not rent, sell or otherwise provide the email address of any PictureTrail member to any other company or entity unless the member specifically requests information from that company or entity.
IP Address:
When you register for an account, we record your IP address for diagnostic purposes, to administer our web site and to gather aggregate, anonymous demographic information.

We manage the members area with the use of cookies. We use the cookies to verify member authorization to the members area, for diagnostic purposes, to administer our web site and to gather aggregate, anonymous demographic information.
Registration and Account Upgrade Forms:
When you sign up for an account we ask you to provide contact information (email address) plus demographic information (like zip code, country, age, gender and current job type). We use this information as part of our aggregate demographic information gathering analysis and to help generate the appropriate promotional material from some of our partners.

Contests, Surveys and Other Promotional Campaigns:
We periodically conduct optional surveys on our website and via email asking for your preferences in site usage and about the type of promotional material and products you may be interested in. We use data from our surveys to send information to our users about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. We also run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like name, email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about the results of these contests and about our company.

We sometimes use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.
