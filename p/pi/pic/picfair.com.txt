Privacy Policy | Picfair
Last Updated 24 May 1018
Who we are, and what is this?
We're Picfair, a company that wants to help photographers make money from their creativity. Our offices are at 154-158 Shoreditch High St, London E1 6HU. Our registered address is 5 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3TW - that's the address of our Company Secretary, who are also our lawyers Taylor Wessing. They always forward on any correspondence they receive for us at that address, but if you want to get hold of us quickly, or send us postcards (and please do), the Shoreditch High Street address is the most direct route. Quicker still, you can always email us, about anything, at hello@picfair.com.
This Privacy Policy is our way to try to explain as clearly as possible exactly how we use and collect your data. We've tried to explain and collate as much as possible, but if there's anything we need to add or amend, we reserve the right to make changes to it it, without giving you notice, whenever we need to. But it will always be here, on our website, if you ever want to check for updates.
Importantly, if you ever wish to request any personal information we hold on you, you can do that whenever you like, by emailing datarequest@picfair.com.
Collection of personal information
1. Browsing Picfair
You can browse Picfair's millions of beautiful images from across the globe without logging in or submitting any personal information.
We use a number of analytic products to track visitor behaviour on our site, because we're always trying to make Picfair as useful as possible. This means we monitor things like clicks, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser types, CPU speed, site performance, operating systems and device types, time spent on pages, time and time zone, the page that referred you to us, Internet Service Providers, and pages viewed. We use this information to analyse trends and improve site functionality on an individual and aggregate basis.
These analytic services rely on software such as cookies. Cookies are small, unique text files that a website sends to your computer when you visit a site and do things on it - these can be session cookies which terminate when you close a browser, or persistent cookies which will remain until you delete them. For example, we use a persistent cookie for your login, so that you don't need to log in every time you visit Picfair. You can always easily delete all cookies that a website is using by deleting them in your browser settings.
Here's the services we use when you browse Picfair (this also applies to logged-in users too):
Papertrail - this keeps a temporary record of any page that loads on Picfair, and how it loads (i.e. "it loaded!", or "Oh no it didn't load!". We use it to look out for any pages that are broken so we can fix them.)
Honeybadger - we use this to tell us if a page is definitely broken. It's like Papertrail's "bad news only" cousin.
NewRelic - this monitors the overall performance of the site, especially page speed. If a page is taking 17 years to load, we need to know about it.
Google Firebase - we use this to count the "pic views" on images, so we can let our photographers know which of their images are the most popular. It's a very fancy way of counting from one to a billion.
Google Analytics - this is "web analytics" stuff above - anonymous for users that are not signed in but identifiable for those who are signed in.
Social Media analytics (Facebook and LinkedIn)
Hotjar - Page heatmaps and feedback collection
