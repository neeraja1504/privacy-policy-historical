Our privacy policy
Introduction
Redgate (which means here Redgate Software Limited and its subsidiary Red Gate Software Inc.) respects your privacy. All information you give us is held with the utmost care and security.
Please take time to review this privacy policy as it sets out our privacy practices and tells you how your personal information will be treated by us. We do not sell, rent or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. Only in the circumstances described within this Privacy Policy would we share your information with any third party.
Our use of personal data in the UK is in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and our Subsidiary’s practices in the US are as far as reasonably possible in line with those in the UK.
Any questions regarding Redgate’s privacy policy should be directed to privacy@red-gate.com, or alternatively see the section Contacting us.
Use of information
Redgate will not collect any personal information about individuals except as set out in this privacy policy.
Examples of the types of personal information we will collect are: name, company, postal address, email address, phone number, details of website, features and product usage, installation data and product commentary.
We will use the personal information provided to us in order to:
process orders submitted by you;
identify the Redgate 'certified partner' that is best placed to support your software purchase if you cannot purchase directly from us;
customize the service we provide to you;
administrate or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us;
verify your identity (e.g. if you participate in any promotions administered by us);
anticipate and resolve any problems with any goods or services supplied to you;
carry out market research and surveys and track sales data;
send you our newsletter, where this is requested by you;
track your engagement with us, including through our website, articles and newsletters;
understand how you use our products and services;
contact you by telephone and send you follow-up communications relating to your use of software downloaded from our website; and
send you information about our other products and services.
We may collect any personal information provided by you to us through this website or via use of our products, or we may collect this information via one of our telephone operators or through your email or other communications with us. We may collect anonymous answers to surveys or anonymous and aggregated information about how our products are used. Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in the privacy policy.
We may also ask you for other optional information such as what sort of equipment/device/software you use and what other subjects interest you. If you choose to give us this information, we will use it to help us to provide you with the best possible service that is personalized to your needs and preferences.
We may also combine personal information with Product Usage Data to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information volunteered by our customers (and the more accurate it is), the better we can match our services to the needs of the body of our customers.
During the installation process we may give you the opportunity to choose what ‘product use’ information you provide to us.
We also collect information from you if you choose to take part in any of our on-site surveys or promotions. We will use this information to administer the promotion, help us to plan other promotions and improve the services we provide.

Product Usage Data – We collect product usage data which records certain 'in-product' actions and activities such as 'starting a product', 'creating a workflow', 'open a project', 'run deployment wizard', 'format SQL', 'autocomplete', and 'use a snippet'. We do not scan or collect the content of any file or information that might be displayed by an application or used whilst performing such actions or activities.
