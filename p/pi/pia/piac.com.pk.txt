At PIA we are committed to respecting your privacy. This policy describes how we collect, use and disclose personal information concerning our guests and other individuals. This policy may be modified from time to time by posting updated versions on the PIA website and you may also be notified of changes upon logging in to the website.
What is personal information?
Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. Your personal information includes:
Identification number (ID)
Email address
User ID (UID)
Messages on social media
Genetic, physiological, or physical information
Medical information
Location
Bank details
IP address
Cookies
You’re Name
Telephone number
Email address, and any other information that identifies who you are or would allow someone to contact you. Personal information only becomes known to PIA when you provide it to us, or when a third party, such as a travel agent, family member or other party books a ticket on your behalf and provides personal information to PIA with your consent.
Consent
It is our policy to collect, use and discloses personal information about you with your knowledge and consent, unless otherwise required or allowed by law. Prior to collecting personal information, it is our policy to identify the purposes for doing so and to limit the collection, use and disclosure of personal information to those purposes.
Generally, we will collect personal information from you, and use it and disclose it with express consent received from you or from someone on your behalf. There will be occasions where we will rely on opt-out consent with respect to contacting you with offers that we feel will be of interest to you. We will use opt out consent only in circumstances where the personal information in question is not sensitive, where the purposes and circumstances are limited and well-defined and brought to your attention at the time personal information is collected, or where you are given an opportunity to opt-out or withdraw your consent then or at any time by contacting us.
If we identify a new purpose for using or disclosing your personal information, unless otherwise required by law, we will contact you to obtain your consent for the new use or disclosure and we may use your contact information, including your email address, to do so.
Collection and use of personal information
If you would like to fly with us, book a accommodation or car, join a mailing list, apply for a job, participate in a program or enter a contest that may be offered by PIA from time to time, you will be asked for personal information as described in this policy and as stated to you at the time of collection. Personal information may be collected by us through our call centre, or by interaction with our Website, or from you in person, or about you by us from a travel agent or other party obtaining travel services for you on your behalf.
It is our policy to collect personal information about you directly from you where possible or reasonable to do so. However, there are circumstances where personal information about you will be collected from a third party obtaining travel services for you on your behalf with your consent.
Personal information provided by you or on your behalf to book flights or other travel services will generally not be provided to anyone, including a spouse, family member, friend or coworker, without your consent, or as required by law, or as otherwise provided in this privacy policy. To protect your privacy rights and personal information, and for security and legal purposes, we therefore generally cannot disclose your personal information to any individual contacting us and claiming either to be a spouse, family member, friend, co-worker or otherwise entitled to your personal information, or claiming to have your consent for us to do so, unless and until we have verified with you that you do in fact consent to our disclosure of your personal information to such specified individual. The exceptions to this are:
*We will disclose your personal information on a reasonable basis to an individual who has booked your current flight or other travel service where that individual has adequately identified themselves. We will consider that, since they previously had your consent, express or implied, to deal with us, your consent continues. Please Agent or Account Manager in Terms Of Use.
*Where an individual contacts us and provides us with your full name and booking confirmation number giving us reasonable grounds to conclude they are contacting us with your consent, express or implied, we will disclose flight information to that individual for the purposes of permitting that individual to meet your flight or be aware of delays, and other similar information. Flight information is limited to flight number, flight timing information, confirmation that you have or have not boarded a flight, and the departure and arrival locations of your journey with us. Flight information is provided as a service and convenience to you to permit meeting your flight and being aware of any delays or flights that are early. We will not provide other personal information such as home address or contact information to other individuals in these circumstances without your express consent. If you do not wish individuals to be able to obtain flight information from us, you should not share your PNR number with them. Otherwise, we will conclude that, where an individual has your full name and booking confirmation number you have given your consent to their contacting us for your flight information. Booking confirmation number refers to the confirmation number assigned by PIA to you for a specific flight.
Booking a Flight
When you book a flight with us, or when someone books a flight with us on your behalf, we will ask for your gender, name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card information. We collect this information in order to process your request for travel services or to process refunds. We need your gender to determine the weight and balance of our aircraft and to assist us in identifying you for legal and security purposes. We may also use your personal information to contact you about your flight booking or about anything that may affect your flight booking or your flight.
PIA may also use your personal information to contact you about your travel patterns and your experiences when flying with us.
Adequate personal identification documents, including photographic likenesses, will generally be required in order to permit you to board an aircraft or access other services. This information is collected for security, legal and identification purposes and is generally returned to you immediately and not retained.
Requirements of Government Authorities
Because of the nature of the airline industry, and concerns with respect to safety and security, there may be situations in which PIA is required by legal authorities to collect, use or disclose personal information about you, particularly when you are traveling with us, without your knowledge or consent. Information that we are required to collect by any Canadian government authorities, depending on your boarding location and destination, may include, as required by such authorities, your full name, date of birth, citizenship, gender, passport number and country of issuance, drivers license and province of issuance or other photo identification, the means by which you paid for your flight, details as to how it was booked, and any other personal information collected by us as set out in this policy or as required by such government authority.
