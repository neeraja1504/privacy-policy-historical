When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information.

Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
Send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or information derived from your IP address. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.

When a Pacific International Lines web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.
