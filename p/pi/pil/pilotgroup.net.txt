9.4. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.
10. Does Pilot Group Ltd process my end users’ personal information?
Yes, we do, and there are two reasons why we can process your end users’ personal information.
10.1. Number one is we are hosting your website. The legal basis for our processing of data is the contract performance. You as the site owner will be the controller of the end users’ data.
The third party that is involved is Hetzner Online GmbH, a hosting company and data centre operator based in Gunzenhausen, Germany. This is their privacy policy explained: https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/datenschutz/
10.2. Number two is you are joining the Dating Pro Network, the community of independent dating website owners who exchange members’ information without giving away their contact details.
The legal basis for our processing the data is the end users’ consent and, in most of the cases, the performance of the contract that the members of the Network have with us.
For example, we use their information to maintain their account and their profile, to recommend other users to them, and to make their profiles viewable to other users.
Note: All the records and data relating to the people who have registered through your dating website belong to you as the site owner.
11. When and why does Pilot Group Ltd share the personal information of my end users?
11.1. We share the personal information of your end users with the Network partner websites in order to make the user profiles discoverable by more people across the Network.
The information about an end user is only sent to the Network and shared with the partner websites if they have given their explicit consent to join the Network.
11.2. If they do not give their consent, the information will not be sent to the Network database and will only remain in the database of the original dating website (parent website).
If they decide to withdraw their consent at any time later, their information will be deleted from the Network database as well as from the databases of partner websites, within a reasonable period of time after we receive notice of the withdrawal.
11.3. If an end user has given consent, their information is forwarded to the partner websites as long as the end user’s data corresponds with the partner’s requirements, including age, gender, orientation, site language, location, and the type of the parent dating website.
12. What information about my end users does Pilot Group Ltd collect and process?
Personal information is crucial in helping people develop meaningful connections. That is why we collect and process information within the scope of the Dating Pro Network.
12.1. This is the information that the Network system sends to its database and shares with the partner websites in order to make a user profile discoverable by more people across the Network.
User profile information:
Login credentials, not visible to other members (email in an encrypted format).
Profile information, not visible to other members (user ID, site language).
Profile information, visible to other members (nickname, date of birth, gender, preferred partner gender, preferred partner age, chosen location, profile picture).
Additional profile information, visible to other members if provided by the user (first name, last name, gallery photos, body type, hair colour, height and weight, race, religion, smoking and drinking habits, more).
12.2. This is the information that the partner websites exchange via server requests to the Network server, however, it is not stored in the database but transmitted directly.
Activity and usage information:
End user’s online/offline status.
Users they connect and interact with, time and date of the exchanges, number and content of messages that they send and receive via the site messengers.
12.3. We do not collect and process any other information within the scope of the Dating Pro Network, including and not limited to the users’ financial information, device information, and more.
13. How can my end users withdraw their consent to join the Dating Pro Network?
Your end user will need to send you an email with the notice which you then forward to us, to the address privacy@pilotgroup.eu. We will delete the end user’s information from the Network database and start the deletion process that will remove the information from the partner websites as well.
Your end users will remain members of your website, regardless of whether or not they choose to take part in the Network.
