Privacy settings
Logged in members may choose which fields display publicly.
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
In order for children under the age of thirteen to join this website, a parent or guardian must approve it. This is in accordance with U.S. law, but is applied internationally as a civil standard.
A notice will be sent, by e-mail, to the e-mail address given when a child joins, which will provide notice on how to approve the membership.
The parent or guardian has the option to agree to the collection and use of the child's information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.
PirateShip.com may not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.
The parent or guardian can review the child's personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information. This may be done by contacting the staff in the same way as was done to approve the membership originally.
