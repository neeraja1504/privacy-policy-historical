When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
When you publish a piZap image and make it “public”, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of PiZap.com, to view that image, and to associate it with your piZap username and/or your linked Facebook profile.

You will not use PiZap if you are under 13 without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
You will not use PiZap if you are a convicted sex offender.
If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

You will not post content or take any action on PiZap that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.
