Notice to California residents
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident's personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its privacy policy that we provide consumers with a choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties' and affiliates' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. At this time, we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties' or affiliates' direct marketing purposes. lf we do so in the future, we will provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. lf you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.
Note to EEA residents
You have the right to request access to personal data that we may process about you. lf you wish to exercise this right, you should:
put your request in writing;
include proof of your identity and address (eg a copy of your driving licence or passport, and a recent utility or credit card bill); and
specify the personal data you want access to, including any account or reference numbers where applicable.
We shall provide a copy of the personal data we process. However, for any further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee for the administration costs.

if your objection is not to direct marketing in general, but to direct marketing by a particular channel (eg email or telephone), please specify the channel you are objecting to.
Do-Not-Track Signals
Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other "Do Not Track" ("DNT") mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site.
Data Security
We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
Unfortunately, the lnternet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Services.

Our Services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. lf we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. lf you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at privacy@pioneerdj.com.

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which it was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the personal information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
