Due to our compliance obligations, for professional services we’ll delete your personal data from our archives within ten years from your last use of the Services.
How we store your information
We collect information globally and store that information in the European Union (Vienna, London and Frankfurt) on our own servers and that of our service providers as part of providing the Services. These service providers are based inside the European Economic Area. We do not store or transfer personally identifiable information outside the EEA.
Security of your information
We take security of your data seriously and work hard to avoid loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure. No security system is perfect and despite our efforts and the distributed nature of the Internet, we can’t guarantee that your personal data will be absolutely secure, either while it is being transmitted or while stored on our systems.
Access and Control of your Information
You have rights with respect to your personally identifiable information. We have compiled a list of choices below that you may make with additional information on how to make them happen.
You have the right to:
- request access to personally identifiable information we hold about you;
- deactivate your account;
- update your personally identifiable information;
- delete your personally identifiable information;
- ask us to stop using your personally identifiable information;
- ask us not to use your personally identifiable information to profile you or make automated decisions about you;
- stop receiving communications from us; and
- ask us to port your data to another service provider if technically feasible, or to provide you with a copy of personally identifiable information we hold about you in a structured, electronic format.
You can accomplish most of these directly using the tools we provide to you as part of the Service. If you are unable to do so using the tools we provide, please contact our support through the help section of our website, or e-mail us at support@pioneers.io. Depending on the choices you make, it may not be possible for us to continue to provide you with the Services after we implement your choices. This may result is us closing your account or your use of the Services being limited or not possible.
Warranties and Disclaimers
We are committed to deliver our Services and contents to you with the highest professional standard and constant availability. We cannot guarantee, however, that Services:
- will be always be free from defects, inaccuracies or errors,
- always available,
- will meet your requirements,
- will operate in the configuration or with other hardware or software you use.
In addition, we may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.
Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither JFDI nor its suppliers or distributors makes any specific promises about the Services. For example, we do not make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
Liability for our Services
When permitted by law, JFDI and JFDI’s suppliers and distributors will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues or data, production, anticipated savings, business, contracts, commercial opportunities, goodwill, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages.
No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Services provided by us, will create any warranty not expressly made herein. Your use or reliance on any Content or other information, material, views or opinions in, or in relation to, the Services is at your own risk. You should exercise good judgement and caution as many individuals and entities add their information to the Service and we do not represent, warrant or guarantee in any way whatsoever that anything in the Service is reliable, accurate, correct, accurate or truthful. Content on the websites is the sole responsibility of those that submit it and can be harmful, incorrect, inappropriate or offensive.
In all cases, JFDI and its suppliers and distributors will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
Business uses of our Services
Technically, JFDI cannot determine with certainty whether a logged-on user of the Pioneers website de facto represents the person/company that the user/the company purports to be. JFDI therefore shall not assume any liability whatsoever for the actual identity of a user. Each and every user is solely responsible for personally verifying the authenticity of other users.
If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify JFDI and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees from any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.
Customer support
JFDI is available by email at support@pioneers.io to address any issues you may have regarding your use of the Services. Most concerns can be quickly resolved in this manner.
Changes to Terms of Service
We may update these Terms from time to time. You understand and agree that your access to or use of our Services is governed by the Terms effective at the time of your access to or use of our Services. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a revised version of the Terms on our Site. We will also indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last made. You should revisit these Terms on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. You understand and agree that your continued access to or use of our Services after the effective date of modifications to the Terms indicates your acceptance of the modifications.
