As you interact with the Websites or Services, we may automatically collect Technical, Usage, and Location Information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Information by using cookies, pixel tags, embedded scripts and other similar technologies. Please see information about our cookie policies in Section VII.B for further details.
Cookies – Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your Device while you are viewing the website that are stored on the Device. Cookies can be used for many purposes, including to monitor use of websites, to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to speed up your searches and purchases and to recognize you when you return to websites and/or store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit websites. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Websites, Services, or our content may not function properly.
P ixel Tag – Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear GIFs, 1×1 GIFs Web beacons, or Web bugs) are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included on the Websites, Services, and in our e-mail messages. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s Device, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a pixel tag. Pixel Tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites or use the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
E mbedded Scripts – Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites and Services, such as the links you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the Websites or Services.
T hird parties or publicly available sources. We may receive Personal Information about you from various third parties. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. Examples of third-party sources include:
Technical Information from analytics providers;
Contact, Financial and Transaction Information from providers of technical, payment and delivery services.
Identity, Profile, and Contact Information from publicly available sources, including websites and forums on the internet.
A ctivating additional features. We may receive additional Personal Information about you if you elect to activate optional features or services as set forth below

IV.  T HIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS & AD SERVERS; ONLINE TRACKING
PSafe works with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, to serve advertisements, including our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may use Device Identifier and Usage Data to compile reports on user activity. For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to our Websites or Services, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and pixel tags) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Data and related information about you. Cookies and pixel tags, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you, and assist in providing analytics.
These third parties may also transfer Device Identifier and Usage Data to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics information on their behalf. Each of these third party’s ability to use and share Device Identifier and Usage Data is restricted by their respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of third-party analytics services, please contact us at privacy@psafe.com.
We may share Device Identifier and Usage Data about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors to help analyze how users use the Websites and Services. These analytics services may use their own software development kits (SDKs) to collect information such as how often and what features of the Websites and Services users use. We use this information to improve the Websites and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their respective terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.
While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
For additional information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members and DAA Self-Regulatory Program participating companies, you may visit:

Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while visiting the Services and elsewhere online. Some third parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. However, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, the Websites and Services currently do not respond to or alter their practices when they receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.

A cookie is a data file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.

Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by the user before the expiration date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

PSafe uses commercially reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
However, please note that no system can be completely secure and although PSafe will use all reasonable endeavors to protect the integrity of the information you provide, we do not ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
