Making the security of information a priority
Keeping financial information secure is one of our most important responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect customer information. Appropriate employees are authorized to access customer information for business purposes only. Our employees are bound by a code of ethics that requires confidential treatment of customer information and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to follow this code.
Disclosing information in certain situations
We may disclose customer information to credit bureaus and similar organizations when required or permitted by law. For example, customer information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, fraud prevention or investigation, risk management and security and recording of deeds of trust and mortgages in public records. Customer information may also be disclosed to companies that process your requests for products or services or in connection with the sale of your account to another financial institution.
