FAQs
Q: Does PSCU Financial Services use cookies in any of their web products?
A: Whenever possible, PSCU Financial Services avoids the use of cookies in its applications. This is to ensure that our web applications run on as wide a variety of web browsers and viewers as possible.
Q: What kind of security does PSCU Financial Services have in place to safeguard sensitive information, such as account numbers, that users may enter?
A: Any sites that PSCU Financial Services hosts to support its web products, such as InfoLink and PayLink, are secure sites. This means that all exchanges between the end user's web browser and the sites are protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption. PSCU Financial Services further uses Verisign Class-3 Security Certificates to enable 128-bit encrypted SSL sessions in some browsers that only have 56-bit cypher strength, such as Microsoft's browser that is approved for export outside of the United States. This is especially relevant to credit unions that have an overseas membership base.
Q: How does PSCU Financial Services protect its data center from intrusion by hostile forces?
A: PSCU Financial Services' internetworking architecture includes several components that collectively provide a high degree of protection from unwanted intrusions or malicious hacking attempts. Our routers include packet-filtering capabilities; our firewalls hide all of our internetworks from the public Internet; and we use intrusion detection and scanning hardware and software to detect any threats to security in real-time.
Q: How secure is my bill payment and personal information?
A: PSCU Financial Services and its electronic billing and payment partner, CheckFree, use several methods to ensure that your members' bill payment information is secure.
User Name and Password - The user name and password that your members use to access Web Bill Pay are unique identifiers that only your member knows. As long as your members do not share their user name and password with anyone, no one but the member can sign in to use Web Bill Pay.
SSL and Encryption - Web Bill Pay uses SSL (secure sockets layer) and 128-bit encryption, which ensures that your connection and information are secure from outside inspection.
Automatic Sign Out - Web Bill Pay automatically signs a user out of a session if the user is inactive longer than ten minutes.
Q: What does PSCU Financial Services do with information it captures during a member's use of any of its Internet products?
A: Currently, PSCU Financial Services does not share any member-provided information with any outside parties. The information is stored in databases in our secure data center. However, it is possible that in the future PSCU Financial Services may need to share aggregated demographic information with select partners to facilitate the building of programs and campaigns for cultivating lasting customer relationships and loyalty.
Q: Will we use any IP addresses to analyze any of our user trends?
A: Whether we specifically use IP addresses or some other tracking or auditing data elements, we will need to analyze user behavior within our sites. This is to enable us to track consumer volume, determine requirements for additional hardware and software, create usage reports for subscribing institutions, and measure the success of our products.
Q: Will any of PSCU Financial Services' web sites hyperlink to other web sites?
A: Yes, but in most cases the link will be transparent to the user. In other words, a PSCU Financial Services site may transfer control to another partner's site to manage a particular element of a session, such as bill payment using the CheckFree bill payment engine.
