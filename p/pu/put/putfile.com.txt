We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register. With your consent, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as content providers, online entertainment Web sites, and manufacturers of accessories or media player devices, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or services of a particular third-party.
We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.

We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of ZVUE's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event ZVUE becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, ZVUE or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.
ZVUE may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors (for example, the number of visitors) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors that visit the ZVUE site and how those visitors use the site.
Third Party Advertisers and Other Site Links
ZVUE allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the ZVUE Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the ZVUE Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
ZVUE does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ZVUE to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-38) or audience segment (for example, men ages 21-25) who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the ZVUE Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers.  For more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. ZVUE's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

You may review, correct, update or change your account profile information at any time. Simply log into your account, review your account information and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided.
If you opted to receive newsletters, special offer e-mails or other communications from ZVUE or third parties at the time you registered, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your account profile as described above. If you previously opted not to receive such communications, you may later opt-in by editing your account profile. We also provide the option of un-subscribing by clicking a link provided in the e-mail. It may take up to 10 days for a removal request to be processed.
Security
ZVUE has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
When you place an order online at ZVUE, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. ZVUE uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.
