WHO WE ARE
When we refer to “we” (or “our” or “us”), that means Pushpay Holdings Limited and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries comprising the Pushpay Group. Our headquarters are in New Zealand but we operate and have offices in the United States. Address details for all Pushpay offices are available on our Contact Us page.
At Pushpay, we build and provide solutions that drive participation and generosity between organizations and their members. For more information, visit the About Us section of our Website.
When you use our Services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.
This notice applies to pushpay.com and any other websites we own or operate (collectively, our “ Website” ) and all products and services we provide, including our online and mobile giving, payments, engagement services, products, and applications, and any other apps or services we may offer. For the purpose of this notice, we’ll just call them our “ Services.”
When we say “Personal Data” or “personal information”: we mean identifiable information about you, including like your name, email, address, telephone number, bank account details, payment information, or other online identifiers. If you can’t be identified (for example, when Personal Data has been aggregated and anonymized) then this notice doesn’t apply. Check out our User Agreement for more information on how we treat your other data.
By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what limited circumstances, if ever, we disclose it. Continued access or use of Services shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using the Services.
This Privacy Policy does not cover information that you submit on other websites that are not operated by us, even if we communicate with you on those sites. For example, if you post something on Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, that information is governed by the privacy policies on those websites, and is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
OUR PRINCIPLES OF DATA PROTECTION
Our approach to data protection is built around three key principles. They’re at the heart of everything we do relating to Personal Data.
Trust: Trust is very important to us and we know it’s important to you. When you entrust us with Personal Data, we understand this is a big responsibility and being good data stewards is of paramount importance to us.
Transparency: We are open, honest and transparent in how we treat your Personal Data.
Security: We believe that faith-based organizations not-for-profits, and all organizations deserve access to solutions that champion leading approaches to security. We’re committed to protecting your Personal Data and have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place designed to keep your data safe and secure. For more information about security, check out our Security Page.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR DATA
When you visit our Website or applications, or use our other Services, we collect Personal Data. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorized into the following:
Information you provide to us directly: When you visit or use some parts of our Website, applications and/or other Services, we may receive information from you, for example, when you register for an account, make a payment, or provide information to us in any other way through your use of the Services). For example, we ask for your contact information when you sign up for an account, respond to a job application or an email offer, participate in community forums, join us on social media, take part in training and events, contact us with questions or request support, and you may provide us with payment details when you set up an account for purposes of making or receiving payments. If you don’t want to provide us with Personal Data, you don’t have to, but it might mean you can’t use some parts of our Website, applications, or other Services.
Information we collect automatically: We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our Website, applications, or use our other Services, like your IP address and device type. We also collect information when you navigate through our Website, applications, or other Services, including what pages you looked at and what links you clicked on. This information is useful for us as it helps us get a better understanding of how you’re using our Website, applications and other Services so that we can continue to provide the best experience possible (e.g., by personalizing the content you see).
Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies. If you want to find out more about the types of cookies we use, why, and how you can control them, take a look at our Cookie Notice.
Information we get from third parties: The majority of information we collect, we collect directly from you. Sometimes we might collect Personal Data about you from other sources, such as individuals or organizations who use our Services, publicly available materials or trusted third parties like our marketing and research partners. We use this information to supplement the Personal Data we already hold about you, in order to better inform, personalize and improve our services, and to validate the Personal Data you provide.
HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
First and foremost, we use your Personal Data to operate our Website and applications and provide you with any other Services you’ve requested, and to manage our relationship with you. We also use your Personal Data for other purposes, which may include the following:
To communicate with you. This may include:
providing you with information you’ve requested from us (like training or education materials) or information we are required to send to you;
operational communications, like changes to our Website, applications, or other Services, security updates, or assistance with using our Website, applications, or other Services;
marketing communications (for example, about a product or service we think you might be interested in based on your marketing preferences); and
asking you for feedback or to take part in any research we are conducting (which we may engage a third party to assist with).
To support you: This may include assisting with the resolution of technical support issues or other issues relating to the Website, applications, or other Services, whether by email, in-app support or otherwise.
To enhance our Services and develop new ones: For example, by tracking and monitoring your use of Website, applications, and other Services so we can keep improving, or by carrying out technical analysis of our Website, applications, and other Services so that we can optimize your user experience and provide you with more efficient tools.
To protect: So that we can detect and prevent any fraudulent or malicious activity, and make sure that everyone is using our Website, applications, and other Services fairly and in accordance with our terms of use.
To market to you: In addition to sending you marketing communications, we may also use your Personal Data to display targeted advertising to you online – through our own Website, applications, and other Services or through third party websites and their platforms.
To analyze, aggregate and report: We may use the Personal Data we collect about you and other users of our Website, applications, and Services (whether obtained directly or from third parties) to produce aggregated and anonymized analytics and reports, which we may share publicly or with third parties.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR DATA
There will be times when we need to share your Personal Data with third parties. We will only disclose your Personal Data to:
other companies in the Pushpay group of companies;
third party service providers and partners who assist and enable us to use the Personal Data to, for example, support delivery of, or provide functionality on, our Website, applications, or our Services, or to market or promote our Services to you;
regulators, law enforcement bodies, government agencies, courts or other third parties where we think it’s necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify you of this type of disclosure;
an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with an actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business; and
others where we have your consent.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
When we share data, it may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in – such as to the United States, where our data hosting provider’s servers are located. These countries may have laws different to what you’re used to. Rest assured, where we disclose Personal Data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your Personal Data remains protected.
For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), this means that your data may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data (like New Zealand), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your Personal Data – for example, by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US-based third parties). For further information, please contact us using the details set out in the Contact us section below.
EU-US AND SWISS-US PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORKS

Pushpay adheres to and will abide by the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability when processing such Personal Data.
Pushpay is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under each Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.

With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
