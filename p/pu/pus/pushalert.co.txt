2. Information We Collect

We may use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls). Note that if you disable cookies entirely, PushAlert’s Websites may not function properly. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union, click here).

End Users:
PushAlert provides web push notification services that our Customers use to engage with end users of their website. Web Push is based on informed consent and no data is collected from end-users without them first opting into web push notifications on their browsers. The next points relate to data collection, only after consent is provided.
We collect End Users’ information when they use our Customers’ websites, web applications, and APIs. This information may include but is not limited to anonymized IP addresses (last octet removed), location, system configuration information, and URLs of Customer’s website accessed by end user (collectively, "Log Data"). We collect and use Log Data to operate, maintain, and improve our Services in performance of our obligations under our Customer agreements.
For ecommerce automation we may also collect cart and order information including but not limited to cart identifier, order identifier, customer name. This data is only collected if our ecommerce marketing features or APIs are enabled. This data is used to provide order and product updates to end users to which they have subscribed to. It is our Customers who are responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the collection of personal information from their end-users to enable and use these features.
Cookies. We use functional cookies and browser local storage to keep track of end-user subscription and these are only created after interacting with web push opt-in. These functional cookies and browser local storage data are not shared with any third-party and do not contain any personal information. No third-party cookies are stored on end-user devices. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls).

Legal Basis for Processing (EEA only)
If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information collected and the specific context in which we collect it.

Please note that in most cases, if you do not provide the requested information, PushAlert will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at support@pushalert.co.

7. Data Subject Rights
Attendees, Website Visitors, and Customers : You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information. You may email us at support@pushalert.co with any such subject access requests ("SAR"), and we will respond within thirty (30) days. Customers also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at PushAlert.co.
End Users : You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information. You can delete your information stored with us by unsubscribing from notifications by following the instructions here. PushAlert automatically removes expired endpoints and associated data. You may also email us at support@pushalert.co with any such subject access requests ("SAR") with your Subscription Key (How to get subscription key?), and we will respond within thirty (30) days. In case our Customers receive a SAR from an end-user regarding our service, PushAlert will unequivocally comply with the request.
For any SAR, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist. Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy rights. We will comply with SARs to the extent required by applicable law. In the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
8. Data Portability
We strive for data portability. You can export all the endpoints and associated data required for web push and move to a different service pursuant to the conditions mentioned below. If you require data portability please make sure you use your own FCM/GCM configuration, while registering for PushAlert or while adding a new website to your PushAlert account and also use your own HTTPS domain/subdomain.
Technical Limitations:
If you use HTTP integration method then the subscriptions are bound to a PushAlert subdomain, so you cannot move this subscription data to a different service due to technical limitations. Similarly, if you use the HTTPS method of integration but do not use your own FCM/GCM configuration, your subscriptions will be tied to PushAlert, and you cannot move this subscription data to a different service. Additional technical limitations apply to Safari desktop and to legacy products.
You can request for a data export by reaching out to support@pushalert.co.
9. Data Retention
We retain your personal information to provide services to you and as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
