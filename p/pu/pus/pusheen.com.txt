Your use of our Services is also subject to the terms of our Terms of Service. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.
If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, please see Section 8 below titled “Supplemental Notice to EU Data Subjects.”
SECTION 1 – Information We Collect

In the event that you reach the checkout and fill out your Personal Information but decide to abandon your cart, your cart and Personal Information will still be stored in our system as an abandoned cart (collectively, “Abandoned Cart Information”). Abandoned Cart Information can be deleted at your request at any time. We may also send you an automated e-mail within 24 hours of abandoning your cart to remind you to complete your purchase.

1.4 Payment Information. Our store is hosted by Shopify Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. When you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Shopify stores your purchase transaction data only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After your purchase transaction is complete, Shopify deletes your purchase transaction data. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
