Ltd.,  Puppet Labs S.R.L., and Puppet Kabushiki Kaisha as joint controllers (collectively referred to here as “we,” “our,” or “Puppet”) created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect use, and share information through our website and other interactions and set out the rights individuals have to control the use of their information.  For more detail on the roles the different Puppet companies perform, please see More Details.
This policy applies to:
visitors to users of our website at www.puppet.com, and other Puppet websites like forge.puppet.com, learn.puppet.com, and buy.puppet.com, etc. (together "the Site" )
people who register for or attend our exams or events
individuals who sign up through the Site or otherwise to receive newsletters and other marketing or sales updates about Puppet and our products and services
individuals who choose to take part in contests, surveys and other promotions which may take place through the Site or otherwise

individuals who purchase or inquire about our products and services through the Site, by telephone or otherwise
We call all these people “customers” in our policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply, however, to Puppet employees, employment applicants, suppliers, distributors or trade contacts except when they are acting in a “customer” capacity.
Important note for European users and customers: Please note that information covered by this Privacy Policy will be hosted and stored in the USA, which does not have similar data protection laws to the EU.
While our Site or other materials may include links or references to non-Puppet websites, materials or entities, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those non-Puppet sites, materials or entities unless otherwise indicated.
Data protection law in Europe contains a number of "lawful bases" – which are really legal justifications which mean organizations like us are allowed to have your personal information in the first place.  For our EU users, we have been careful to ensure we have a lawful basis for all data we have. More Details.

Online, we may collect information through our Site, an affiliated site (such as a promotional microsite linked to our site), a Puppet page on a community website (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or the like) or through similar online avenues. In many cases, such information will be collected directly from you, such as through a transaction or inquiry (including via a telephone call) or your submission of a form, registration or communication to us. Information may also be gathered from our affiliates and from third-party sources including without limitation:

As you use our website, some information can be “passively” collected using various technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and navigational data collection (clickstream, log files, server logs). Your Internet browser automatically transmits some of this information, such as the URL of the website you just visited and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser version currently being used by your computer. Additionally, we utilize widgets on our website so that you can either share information with third party social media sites or connect to your social media account. By associating your social media account with this site or by interacting with them, we may be given access to certain information about the content you viewed on that site, subject to the access permissions you grant on that third party site and to the separate privacy settings and privacy policy of that site. Any such information provided to us by social media sites will be subject to our privacy policy. Such technologies help us to keep track of your interactions with our website and provide you with a more customized experience. We also engage with digital advertising partners to advertise our products and services to you on social media platforms and other websites, and they may share some information regarding your use of the Site with platforms in the digital advertising ecosystem. More Details.
We use personal data about customers for a wide range of purposes. We use it to respond to your requests (including requests for newsletter subscriptions, materials, pricing and so on); to provide products or services that you have ordered; to process your order transactions and contact you regarding your order; to invite and help you participate in a range of online and offline events and activities; to allow you to post information and other content online; to improve our products, services and websites; to follow up with you after you have communicated with us or submitted information to us; to send promotional or marketing communications or offers (unless you have requested that we not send such communications or, where the law requires consent, you have not given consent); for research and legal purposes and other purposes (including, without limitation, call center or training session recordings made for quality and standards assurance purposes); to permit you to participate in and to otherwise administer competitions, promotions and contests; to allow you to communicate with other customers (for example, you may ask or answer questions with other customers on ask.puppet.com and on Puppet-related channels on other platforms like Slack and Google Cloud Messaging); to address your interests and concerns; and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy and/or at the point of personal data collection.

In some cases, we work with other companies who help to gather information from you or help us to communicate with you.  Where consultants, service providers and consultants process the personal data of EU or UK users outside the European Economic Area, and in particular in the United States our policy is to have an appropriate legal mechanism in place to ensure that transfer of personal data is in compliance with European data protection law, typically model clauses or standard contractual clauses.

Likewise, we may disclose or transfer personal data to third parties in connection with the sale, assignment or other transfer of our business.
Information submitted by you, including recordings of your participation in training sessions, will be stored, processed and used by us and by our third party service providers who help us to deliver our services and operate our business in the United States of America or other jurisdictions that may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. For customers based in the European Union, please note that the USA does not have similar data protection laws to the EU. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We may make full use of all information that is de-identified or otherwise not in personally identifiable form.

You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.
Security
We take appropriate steps to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, whether in transmission or storage. Please keep in mind, however, that there is no such thing as perfect security, and no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. Moreover, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user name and password you use.

More Details: Puppet Affiliates' Roles

More Details: EU users and our "lawful basis" for using their data
Data protection law in Europe contains a number of "lawful bases" – which are really legal justifications which mean organizations like us are allowed to have your personal information in the first place.  For our EU users, we have been careful to ensure we have a lawful basis for all data we have.  Our lawful bases include:
Performing the contract we have with you
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver Puppet software products and services.  For example, if you want to use Puppet software products and order or download them through our Site, we need your name and contact details so we can communicate with you and provide the software.
Legal compliance
Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement and tax laws require us to retain records of orders and payments for Puppet software and related services, which can include contact details at our corporate clients.
Legitimate interests
This is a technical term in data protection law which really means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which does not hurt your interests and rights.
We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, we will send your promotional communications about our service, subject to your legal rights to control whether we do so.
We do analyze how users interact with our Site and the Puppet software so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
Where we talk about the different data we collect and how we use it in this policy, we aim to mention which lawful basis applies.
More Details: Personal Data Collection
We collect personal data about our customers in a number of ways. In this section, we describe what types of personal data we collect, the ways we collect it and how we use it. While we have tried to be complete, this list is not necessarily exhaustive, given that these activities can vary from time to time. When we collect information, we will tell you at the point of collection what information is required and what information is optional.
The types of personal data collected by us include the following, depending on how you access or use our services:
Contact information , including name, title, street address (home, work, billing, shipping), postal code, country, telephone numbers (home, work, cell, etc.), email address, company name and other similar information.

More Details: Passive Information Collection
As is the case with many websites, our Site uses cookies and other automated information collection means. Cookies are information about you from the website that is stored on your browser or hard drive and may be set by us or by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. Certain cookies on our website last only for the duration of your session and expire when you close the browser whilst other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the site and last for longer. Certain cookies save you time because you do not need to manually re-enter the information stored on your hard drive – for instance when you log back in as a user you can opt to have your browser store your login information and it is a cookie that makes this happen. Cookies also help us upgrade the website by showing when and how users use the site. Most computer and some mobile browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of our website might not work without cookies.
We, or our third party providers, also collect and use information automatically generated as users interact with the Site or our software products, which includes the browser and operating systems types and versions used, installer commands, web interface clicks, mouse gestures, data relating to the submission of online forms (but not the content of the forms), IP addresses, and page views, URLs visited within our software products, error messages and related data about software errors (“Telemetry Data”). Puppet may use and share the Telemetry Data with third parties, like our cloud-based support management system to help Puppet improve the user experience and the Site.
The Telemetry Data collected and used by Puppet is de-identified so that it does not reveal the name, role, contact details or other real world identifiers of users and Puppet does not collect or use any information from content that users process within or uploads to our software platform.  If Puppet is collecting Telemetry Data from the Site, the Customer may opt-out of this functionality at any time.
The Site may also use IP addresses for the same purposes identified above, as well as to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” which triggers a cookie to collect information about your visits to the Site and to other websites, and they may use that information and share and combine it with other information with their partners to show you advertisements for goods and services you might be interested in on the Website and on other websites and apps and social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn including by observing the kinds of products and subject-matter you are interested in and certain demographic information about you.
We may use web beacons (also known as Internet tags or clear GIFs) on our websites to access and set cookies and otherwise help us to better understand how users are moving through our websites. Information provided by the web beacon includes the computer’s IP address, the type of browser being used and the time that the web beacon was viewed. We may also use web beacons in emails and newsletters so that we know when such communications have been opened and to otherwise help us tailor our communications to individual users.
