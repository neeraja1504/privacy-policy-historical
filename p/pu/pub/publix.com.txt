Applicable Law
By using the Services, you agree that the laws of the state of Florida, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Publix.
Disputes
ANY DISPUTE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, EXCEPT FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY (WHICH FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION DO NOT INCLUDE PRIVACY AND PUBLICITY CLAIMS) AND CLAIMS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL-CLAIMS COURT. IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT ARBITRATION IN TAMPA, FLORIDA WOULD CREATE AN UNDUE BURDEN TO YOU, WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO INITIATE THE ARBITRATION IN YOUR HOME STATE. ANY DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING THE FORUM FOR ARBITRATION WILL BE SETTLED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY UNDER THE CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES THEN PREVAILING OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA'S CONSUMER RULES"), EXCLUDING ANY RULES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING OR PERMITTING CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.

PUBLIX AND YOU AGREE TO EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS TO FILE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS IN ANY JURISDICTION OR FORUM.

THERE SHALL BE NO APPEAL FROM ANY AWARD OF THE ARBITRATOR. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO AN ARBITRATION INVOLVING ANY OTHER PARTY SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER THROUGH CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE. IF ANY PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL, THE REST OF THIS PROVISION SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.
IF THE ENTIRE ARBITRATION PROVISION IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE PARTIES CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND EXCLUSIVE VENUE IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN TAMPA, FLORIDA.
If you initiate the arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules. Regardless of who initiates the arbitration, Publix will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation. If the arbitrator rules against Publix, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, Publix will reimburse your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration.

We may also use technologies to determine if you are shopping in one of our stores by relying on signals transmitted by your mobile devices. We collect this information to provide you with services, content and offers based on your location.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
By using the Services, you consent to our use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, except for the Stockholder Information section of the Services on which the foregoing technologies will not be used. We use these technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with the Services. The information obtained by using these technologies (including the pages you visit on our website, which web address you came from, information about the devices and software you use, and the content you view) helps us in various ways, including to customize your experience, improve the Services, learn what areas of the Services are of most interest to our customers, and troubleshoot any issues. In order to provide the best experience possible, we also use this information for reporting and analysis purposes.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of your browser. You should review the online documentation relating to your browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies on your Internet-enabled device, some parts of the Services may not function properly or offer you the same degree of personalization. In addition, you may be able to exercise choices regarding companies such as online network advertisers via certain third party tools. Read more information about such choices at: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
We may also use technologies that let us know whether you viewed certain content, whether you viewed our emails or other electronic communications, and whether the advertising we place on the Services and other websites or mobile applications is effective.
We use Google Analytics to learn about how you and others use the Services. You can learn more about how Google uses the information it collects at: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
We do not currently respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. Visit the following website, www.allaboutdnt.org, for more information on this developing area.
Third-party Content and Activities
The Services may contain links to content or integrated content (like embedded videos) provided by third parties. The information practices of those third parties may differ from ours. You should consult the privacy policies of any third party that provides content that you access through the Services as we do not control and are not responsible for the information that they collect, use, or share. Because your web browser may obtain integrated content directly from third-party servers, the third parties may be able to collect information as if you had visited their sites directly. Some of the third parties that provide content on our Services or support our business by facilitating online advertising, analytics, or research may use technologies to track your online activities over time and across various websites and other online services.
Security
Publix uses administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information we collect via the Services. However, no information system can be 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit or receive via the Services over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks.
Questions about Our Privacy Policy
Please let us know if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy by contacting us online.
Child Privacy Notice
At Publix, we are committed to protecting your child(ren)'s privacy. We developed this Child Privacy Notice to inform you about our information collection practices and policies with regard to the personal information about your children that you provide to Publix through the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the terms in this Child Privacy Notice. This Child Privacy Notice is an online notice and applies only to the Services.
Publix collects personal information from parents about their child(ren) through the Services in order to provide parents and child(ren) with access to the benefits that the parents have requested. You are sharing personally identifiable information with Publix when you register yourself and your child(ren) through certain portions of the Services.

When you provide personal information about yourself and your child(ren) through certain portions of the Services, that information is collected and maintained by Publix and, depending on the functionality of the service or program, by third parties under contract with Publix. Those third parties are contractually obligated to keep such personal information confidential and secure.
Once registered, a parent is able to modify the information that was supplied through the Services by contacting us.
Please contact us if you have any questions about our Child Privacy Notice.
