Privacy Policy | PUBHTML5
Thank you for visiting PubHtml5.com and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is simple: we will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit the Sites unless you choose to provide that information. This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from PubHtml5.com.
We do not collect nor distribute private data such as credit card numbers at all. Some personal information is recorded for PubHtml5 account purposes. All passwords are non-reversible encrypted (MD5) before being saved to the data base, to ensure that they (and your personal information) cannot be stolen from us, even in case of a hacking attack. We do not collect any passwords at all for users that are connecting using the Facebook Connect API as well as for those connecting with Twitter, Google and Yahoo APIs.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?
When you visit our Sites, we track information including the domain name and the name of the web page from which you entered our Sites, and how much time you spend on each of our pages. We also collect information that is combined with other web visitors' information, such as how many times visitors click on each web page and the methods by which our Sites were found. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We may collect IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our Sites via the use of "cookies."

We use cookies to deliver web content specific to you and to keep track of your online order activity. Cookies cannot pass viruses, harm your computer or pass on private information such as an email address without the computer user's intervention. Cookies contain session identification numbers that allow our systems to recall previous sessions for authentication efforts and assemble information from our gathered data. You can configure your computer's browser to alert you when a site is attempting to send you a cookie and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. In addition to cookies, we may use small bits of computer code called "one-pixel GIFs," "clear GIFs," or "web beacons" embedded in web pages to monitor website activity. We use this collected electronic data to better design our Sites.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
You may be asked to provide personal information in certain fields on our Sites. The personal information we collect is used only for the purpose we state at the time of collection.
