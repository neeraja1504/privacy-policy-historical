Privacy Policy
1. INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information about you.
This Privacy Policy applies to information which identifies you, or from which you can reasonably be identified, such as your name or email address ("personal information"). This Policy describes how we handle the personal information we collect when we provide our services. Our services include: advertising, websites, mobile sites, newsletter subscriptions, applications ("apps"), and widgets, competitions, bet facilitation  and customer surveys (collectively, "Company Services").
Company Services are made available on the following websites across desktop, mobile, tablet and apps (including any subdomains):
punters.com.au;
odds.com.au;
way2bet.com.au;
This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected by our journalists and photographers for the purpose of gathering news. We handle the information we collect in the course of journalism in accordance with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards, which can be found at: http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles.
This Privacy Policy otherwise applies to information about anyone who interacts with us, including advertisers, subscribers and people who use Company Services (both registered and unregistered users).
2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We collect personal information to provide Company Services and for our business operations. If you choose not to provide the information we request from you, we may not be able to provide you with the services you require. We describe the main types of personal information we collect and the main reasons why we collect that information below.
Registration Information is the information you provide to Company when you register for or acquire, or use a Company Service. This may include information you provide us to:
become a website member;
become an advertiser;
post comments;
enter tips;
publish publicly your preferences;
receive payments;
place a bet with a bookmaker;
receive a newsletter; or
enter a competition.
Registration Information includes, for example, your name, email address, bookmaker username, country, state, phone number and confirmation you are over 18.
You are able to use some Company Services without providing any personal information (for example when browsing our digital products as a casual user).
Public Information and Posts include comments or content that you post to the online Company Services and the information about you that comes with those posts. This may include your name, user name, comments, likes, tweets, status, profile information and picture(s). Public Information and Posts are available to everyone who views our websites and may be displayed in search results on external search engines, even after you cancel your account with us.
Information from third party Social Media. If you access or log-in to a Company Service through a third party social media service or connect a Company Service to your social media profile, we may also include information from that social media service. This may include:
your user name for that service;
any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us (such as your profile picture(s), email address, followers or friends lists); and
any other information you have made public (including other posts you make using your social media profile).
We do not collect your social media profile password. When you access Company Services through your social media profile, or when you connect a Company Service to your social media profile, you authorise us to collect and handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Activity Information – cookies and other technologies. When you visit Company's websites (including to access and use Company Services) we may collect information about your visit. For example, in order to connect you to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, which may include your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information from that device.
For more information about cookies and tracking technologies and how to block cookies, see our Cookie Policy.
Information from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources. This may include information from publicly available sources (such as other published content) and data providers, as well as information from our business partners or related and affiliated companies in Australia or internationally.
Information in relation to other persons who deal with us. When you apply for a job or contract with us we may collect information about you to help us decide whether to offer you the job or contract. For example, we may collect information about how to contact you, your education or work history, or other information included in your CV or résumé. We may collect this information from you, or from any recruitment consultant, your previous employers, or other referees. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection, use and disclosure of information:
we hold about you once you become an employee;
we keep after your employment relationship with us ends,
where that collection, use or disclosure relates to your employee relationship with us and the records we hold about you as an employee.
Company also collects personal information about our suppliers and individuals employed by our suppliers (including service and content providers), contractors, dealers, related companies, agents and corporate customers. We will explain why we are collecting this information and how we will use that information, unless it obvious from the circumstances.
3. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?
We use the information we collect about you to provide Company Services to you. As part of our service to you we may use your personal information:
to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services (for example payments & account management);
to enter into contracts with you or third parties;
to fulfill requests for withdrawals of available balance;
to measure and improve Company Services and their individual features;
to improve your experience by delivering content (including editorial, marketing and advertising) we think you will find relevant and interesting;
to publish personal information you have elected to publish publicly on your profile;
to send you information via email or push notification;
for other marketing and client relationship purposes;
to allow you to comment on content, participate in discussion, and participate in games, competitions, or rewards programs;
to provide you with customer support; and
to respond to your enquiries.
We may also remove certain information or alter the information we collect about you so you can no longer be identified from that information. We do this so that we can use it or disclose it to third parties for other purposes.
We use the information we collect about you for the following additional purposes:
Research and data analysis. We may also use your information for research and data analysis to improve Company Services. We may do this research or engage a service provider to do this.
To allow service and content providers to assist us in providing and managing the Company Services. We may make your information available to certain third party service and content providers who help us manage or provide the Company Services or provide Company with related services. This might include providers of cloud services, website hosting service providers, debt collection service providers and direct marketing service providers. These third parties may be located in a range of different countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America and Singapore. Our agreements with these third party providers require them not to use your information except for the purpose for which your information was provided. We also require them to comply with relevant privacy laws.
To allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect a social media profile with your Company Services account, we may share your personal information (including your user name, picture, tweets, likes and posts) with other Company Services users and your friends or followers linked to your social media profile. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.
By logging in with or connecting your Company Services account with a social media profile, you authorise us to share your personal information with the social media service provider, other users and your friends or followers. You understand that the social media service provider may handle this information in accordance with its own privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media profile with your Company Services account and do not participate in social sharing on Company Services.
To provide co-branded services and features. We may offer co-branded services, such as competitions or other promotions together with a third party ("Co-Branded Services"). When this happens, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party, or with our service providers who assist us to host Co Branded Services. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policy. We will obtain your consent to share your personal information with the third party. If you do not provide this consent, you may not be able to access that co-branded service.
To deliver relevant advertisements and content. Company and our advertisers may use the information we collect about you to provide you with relevant advertisements and content when you use Company Services. We may also use your personal information so that relevant advertising can be provided to you when you use services or visit websites of other organisations.
We may combine information that we hold about you with information about you that we collect from other trusted businesses with whom you also have a relationship or from public sources and we may associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use. We may also share information we hold about you with those trusted businesses so that they can do the same thing.
We and those trusted businesses do this in order to enable the development of consumer insights about you so that each of us can serve you better. This includes being able to better understand your preferences and interests, personalise your experience, enhance the products and services you receive, and to tell you about products and services. Where those insights are provided to others for their own marketing purposes, such insights do not contain any information that identifies you. We may also use third party service providers to undertake the process of creating these consumer insights.
For more information about this, please see our Data Usage Policy. In Section 6, below, we provide information about how to choose what advertisements you see when using the Company Services.
To contact you. From time to time, we may send you promotional materials or other information which we think may interest you. For example, we may send you an invitation to participate in various activities (such as customer surveys) or special offers.
To share with our Company Affiliates. Company may share your information with our related companies located in Australia or in other countries, including the United Kingdom and United States of America. If we share your information with our related companies, they can use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, if you access or use a service provided by one of our related companies, you should consider the privacy policy of that company, as it may be different to this policy.
To share with business partners. Company may share your information with business partners so they can send you marketing communications. This will only happen if you have expressly agreed to this.
To protect the rights of Company and others. We may share your information with other third parties where we are lawfully entitled to do so. This includes when we have a reasonable basis to believe that sharing your information is necessary to:
protect, enforce or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Company, our related companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use);
protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Company Services or members of the public;
protect against fraud or for risk management purposes;
comply with the law or legal process in any country; or
respond to requests from public and government authorities.
To complete a merger or sale of assets. If Company sells all or part of its business or assets, we may disclose your information to the party or parties involved in the sale transaction. We may also do this if Company is involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business. We may disclose your information prior to the sale, transfer or merger so that the party or parties involved can consider the transaction and complete any due diligence.
4. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
We use reasonable measures to safeguard the personal information we hold about you from loss, theft and unauthorised use, disclosure or modification, including:
System security We take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorised access to our online and computerised systems by using measures such as firewalls, data encryption, virus detection methods, and password restricted access.
Property security At our business premises, we may engage security personnel and use ID cards to restrict access to those premises.
Staff training We train our staff to handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws.
Third parties We take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who store or assist us to store your personal information adopt appropriate security measures.
5. HOW CAN YOU ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
If you would like to access, review, correct or update your personal information, you may contact us (see section 8). When you contact us, please provide your name and contact details (including your email address, and telephone number) and specify clearly what information you would like to access, review, correct or update. We will need to share your information with others who can help us respond to your request. We will try to respond to your request as soon as reasonably practicable. If we refuse your request we will generally tell you why.
6. HOW CAN YOU OPT OUT?

For more information about how we use cookies, see our Cookie Policy.

If you have linked any of your social media profiles to your account for any Company Service, you can cancel that link by changing your account settings. If you need any assistance with changing your account settings, please call us (see Section 8).
7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU
Updates to Privacy Policy. We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The date at the top of this Privacy Policy tells you when it was last updated. Any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective when we publish it online. If you do not agree with changes to this Privacy Policy, you may be able to terminate your account with us.
Location of Data. Some Company Services are hosted in and managed outside of Australia, including in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Singapore. In dealing with Us, you consent to this practice, understanding that your personal information may be accessible from or transmitted outside Australia.
Linked Services. Company Services (including Company's website) may display links to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, competitions or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these unaffiliated companies. Once you leave the Company Services or click an advertisement you should check the privacy policy of that company to understand how it will handle your information.
Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service provider. Sometimes we allow you to use an unaffiliated payment service to purchase a product or make payments for Company Services (“Payment Service”). If you use a Payment Service, you will be directed to the webpage for that Payment Service. Any information you provide when using a Payment Service may be collected and used by the Payment Service provider in accordance with that provider's privacy policy. You should check the provider's privacy policy to understand how it will handle your information.
Data Retention. Even after you cancel your account with us, we will retain your information for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may retain your information to prevent fraud, or to maintain systems security. We may also retain your information if required or allowed to by law, regulation or relevant standards and codes of conduct, or to fulfil our contractual obligations to a third party. In certain circumstances, including where we are prevented by technical or systems constraints, we may not be able to remove all of your personal information.
If you share your information with a social media service (including by posting information to that service), this information may not be removed even after you cancel your account. If you delete your account with us, your account information may still be accessible by others for a short period of time because of the way that your information is stored on the internet.
Sensitive Information. We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive information (such as information about your racial or ethnic origin, religious or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) when using Company Services, or otherwise. If you do provide us with any sensitive information, you consent to us collecting and handling that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you contact us, please include your name and contact details (including your email address) and clearly describe your complaint. We will need to share your information with others who can assist in responding to your complaint. We will contact you within 7 days to let you know the next steps in resolving your complaint and to obtain any further information we need to consider your complaint.

General Overview
When you visit, access, or use the website, mobile site, application, electronic newsletter or widget that links to this Cookie Policy (collectively "Site") Punters Paradise Pty Ltd ("Punters", "us," or "we") use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver and improve the Site, and to display relevant content, products, services and advertising.
This Cookie Policy explains these technologies, including cookies, local storage, pixels, web beacons, and flash cookies, and how you can control them. In this policy, we will refer to all these technologies as "Cookies".
We hope that this Cookie Policy helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our use of Cookies. If you have any further queries or requests, please contact us at support@punters.com.au.
By using the Site, you agree that we can use these Cookies as described in this Cookie Policy. We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the Last Updated date at the start of this policy to see when this Cookie Policy was last updated. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site.
1. WHAT IS A COOKIE?
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies and local storage, pixel beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data or code that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser (on your computer or mobile device) when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that such websites, apps and other services can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work in a better, more efficient way. For example, they can recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).
2. WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?
We use a variety of different types of Cookies on our Sites. Different Cookies have different specific purposes but in general they are all used so that we can improve your experience in using our Sites and interacting with us. Some of the purposes of different Cookies we use are described below.
(A) Some Cookies are essential to the Site in order to facilitate our log-in process and enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these Cookies, we may not be able to provide certain services or features, and the Site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like.
(B) We may use Cookies to allow us to remember the choices you make while browsing the Site, and to provide enhanced and more personalized content and features, such as customizing a certain webpage, providing relevant advertising or editorial content, remembering if we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog.
(C) We may use Cookies to receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, potentially including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device ("UDID"), geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.
(D) We and our service providers and advertisers may use analytics Cookies, which are sometimes called performance cookies, to collect information about your use of the Site and enable us to improve the way it works. Analytics Cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for instance, which pages you go to most. The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, help us record any difficulties you have with the Site and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.
(E) We and our service providers and advertisers may use advertising Cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may use targeting or advertising Cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our Site, to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns as well as to customize the advertising and content you receive on our Site.
(F) Social plug-in tracking Cookies can be used to track both members and non-members of social networks for additional purposes such as behavioural advertising, analytics, and market research.
We aggregate information received from the various Cookies placed on your browser by our connected network of sites. We may also link our anonymous Cookie ID's with the anonymous Cookie ID's used by third parties, including some of our service providers. This improves our ability to provide you with more relevant editorial and advertising content based on your activity across our connected network. We may also associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use.
All information derived from these Cookies may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, and we may share this information with other organizations, such as advertisers, provided it is anonymised. For more information relating to this see our Data Usage Policy and our Privacy Policy.
3. HOW DO THIRD PARTIES USE COOKIES ON THE SITE?
In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide certain services on our Site. For example, we use analytics services supported by third party companies who generate analytics Cookies on our behalf. We may not have access to these Cookies, although we may use statistical information arising from the Cookies provided by these third parties to customize content and for the other purposes described above. These companies may also transfer this information to other parties including where they are required to do so by law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf.
Third-party advertisers and other organizations may also use their own Cookies to collect information about your activities on our Site and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This should only happen in compliance with our Advertiser Data Policy or otherwise as approved by us. Again, this information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, may be used by them to provide you with advertisements (both on our Site and through other means) that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed.
Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to track aggregate usage statistics.
We may not control these third-party Cookies and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these Cookies. To learn about these Cookies and to disable or reject third-party Cookies, please refer to the relevant third party’s website.
4. HOW CAN YOU OPT OUT?
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Some browsers may include setting that restrict cookies to "websites that you visit". Be aware that at times, before taking you to a page in our network which you have requested to visit, we may momentarily redirect your browser to another of our network sites to place a Cookie onto your browser. This is done to enhance your experience across our connected network of sites and to improve our ability to provide you with more relevant editorial and advertising content based on your activity across our connected network. Such local redirects may be included as "websites that you visit". Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Company Services.
We engage with Nielsen to provide independent audience measurement for some of our websites and apps. You can opt out of third party audience measurement by Nielsen on our websites, go to here: http://www.nielsen.com/content/corporate/policy/en/cookie-policy.html. For apps you will need to access the link which should be available in the app itself.

How and why we target content and advertising material
This Data Usage Policy explains how we target both editorial and advertising content to improve your experience with our digital properties.
We hope that this Data Usage Policy helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our conduct in this regard. If you have any further queries or requests, please contact us at support@punters.com.au
By using any digital property which is linked to this Policy, you agree to our conduct in accordance with this Policy. We may change this Policy at any time. Please take a look at the Last Updated date at the top of this Policy to see when it was last revised. Any changes in this Policy will become effective when we make the revised Data Usage Policy available on or through the Site.
We collect information about your interaction and use of our websites, digital and mobile services across our network. This information does not identify you personally except in some circumstances where you are logged in as a registered user whom we recognise. This information is generally associated with your browser or your device. Some of the information is provided by the browser itself. We also use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and pixels to collect information about your browsing activity on and off our network of digital properties. These technologies may also be used in emails or newsletters we send you and may also be used to identify you on third-party websites.
The information collected can include information such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the website you came from, the pages you view within our network, what you click on and the time you spend on a page. We may associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use. We may also supplement this collected information with information collected from other trusted businesses with whom you also have a relationship or from public sources. All of this is anonymous information (unless we collect it when you are logged in as a recognisable registered user) and we may use it to provide you with editorial content and advertising (both on and off our network of digital properties) which we believe will be more relevant to you. We may also share that anonymous information with third parties for them to provide relevant advertising.
We may also use this collected data for other purposes relating to our business such as data matching, campaign analysis and maximization, modelling and the development of consumer insights about you to better understand your preferences and interests. These processes will usually allow us to enhance our accuracy of personalising the service we provide you as well as targeting relevant content and advertising to you or to assist others with whom we have a commercial relationship to do the same.
You can opt out of us engaging in behavioural targeting of advertising using this collected data on sites operated by our network partner News Pty Ltd by clicking here. Please be mindful that this will not stop all targeting of advertising for various reasons including:
there can still be targeting based on the nature of the content of the page which includes the ad;
third party activity which we do not control; and
IP addresses can be used to generate approximate geographical data which can be used also for determining relevant content.
If you choose to opt out we can still use the anonymous data for other purposes without restriction. The opt out is only in relation to targeting of advertising content. We will continue to use information which we have in order to improve your experience with us and our content. Be mindful also that this opt out is effected using a cookie so that if you delete your cookies you will also be deleting the opt out. You will therefore need to opt out again to prevent our sites targeting advertising to you based on anonymous browsing activity.
