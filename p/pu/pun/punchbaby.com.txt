Privacy Policy
The following information explains what we do with the information you give us. All information you give us is held on computers under the control of Punchbaby. If at any time you have a question about anything contained in this statement or a general query on privacy please do not hesitate to contact us.
How we collect information from you
You will see when you fill in our registration forms that we ask for some personal details from you which we need to have in order to provide you with information on products or events or other information on celebrities, people in the news and other information we think you might like. Please make sure your details are correct and up to date so that we can provide you with this information efficiently. If you donâ€™t want to tell us who you are, donâ€™t bother. We only talk to people who want to hear from us. We also ask for extra bits of information which you do not have to provide us. For some parts of our site we provide you with a password so that you do not have to keep filling in the form each time. The way this works is by using cookies and we explain more about these below. Finally, you donâ€™t have to give us any information if you donâ€™t want to but you might not be able to get the full benefit of our site if you leave certain pieces of information out of the registration forms.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Entering our site
To a computer your email address is just a set of numbers. Unless you tell us what your email address is we wonâ€™t know who you are. We record these numbers when you visit our site but we donâ€™t know who it is who is visiting. We do this to check our computers are working properly and we can also tell how long someone has spent on our site, which bits they looked at, where they have come from and who their internet service provider is. We do not match these numbers with any information you give us if you register but there may be a time where we may try to identify you from these numbers because it is the law or so that we can protect our services and other visitors to our site. Or we might do it to make sure you are complying with our terms and conditions. We sometimes give the information we record to any advertisers on our site and business partners.
Cookies
Many people use cookies. Cookies are small files of information which are stored on your computer. Web sites you visit ask your computer to store this information and retrieve it from your computer so that they can keep track of things like other web sites you visit. We will use them to store your password so that you donâ€™t have to keep filling in a registration form every time you want to log in. We may use them to study things such as places on our web site where you visit and which bits of our site you like best. We may also use them to make sure that any advertisements on our site arenâ€™t always the same when you visit each time and that you see advertising which you might like more than others. If you click on an advertisement to go through to the advertiserâ€™s site, they may also use cookies and unfortunately we donâ€™t have any control over what they use their cookies for. If you donâ€™t want to receive cookies there are things you can do on your computer to stop them being used but you may find that some bits of our website donâ€™t function properly or are slower. You might also have to keep entering registration information each time. It also means we would find it difficult to give you any other information which you might be particularly interested in because we would not be able to recognize that it was you visiting our site.
How we look after your information
We make sure that all the information we hold on you is as safe as possible. You should be responsible when giving out your information on the internet. Make sure that you are careful when you visit our site in a public place like an internet cafe. We can only be responsible for your information when it is received on our computers not whilst it is in any intermediate environment.
When do we give information you provide us to other people?
We never give your information to anyone outside of our company.
