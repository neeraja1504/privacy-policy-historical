What personal information does PunchPin collect?
PunchPin collects personally identifying information during: (i) user registration; (ii) user surveys; and (iv) registration for certain interactive areas on PunchPin and on Web sites that carry the PunchPin brand. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server may collect that visitor's IP address (where possible). In addition, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses of those who make postings to our interactive areas, aggregate information about which pages visitors access, user-specific information about which pages visitors access and how much time is spent in particular areas, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information provided in site registration forms, including but not limited to a visitor's name, address, and phone number may also be collected.  PunchPin may retain personally identifying information indefinitely. PunchPin maintains publicly available user profiles as well, which may contain personally identifying information volunteered by its visitors.
What does PunchPin do with the information it collects?
PunchPin may use personally identifying information of its visitors to award prizes, track compliance with our Terms of Service, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when visitors provide the information). PunchPin does not ever make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to other organizations, although we reserve the right to do so.  In addition, PunchPin may disclose personally identifying information about you, your accounts, or any content you provide on your site, if PunchPin believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, its visitors, or others. PunchPin may collect and disclose such material for use in promoting PunchPin or its services or if PunchPin believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, its visitors, or others. Other companies which provide services on our site, or which advertise on our site, may collect information about you. PunchPin does not control collection or use of this information. You should contact these companies or advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
How to update personal information

About IP addresses
PunchPin collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, if any. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from PunchPin, our servers log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
