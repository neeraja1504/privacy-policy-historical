Notwithstanding any other provision, we may allow third parties to monitor Site activity using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, targeted advertisements, “click-throughs” and/or other activities. We may also engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system) through cookies. The cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device via their pixel on our website and in email communications you've opted to receive from us. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. This information is used to help select and display targeted advertisements that are believed to be of interest to you (sometimes called "online behavioral advertising" or "interest-based advertising" or "OBA"). If you would like to "opt-out" of being served OBA on the Website by our third-party advertising companies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use applications or surf the internet, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers. In order to customize these ads or content, we or a data partner may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, or to data passively collected from you, such as your device identifier or IP address. To learn about how to opt-out, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Use of Cookies
Like most websites, Punchbowl, Inc. uses "cookies" to allow you to bypass the login screen ("Remember Me" functionality). A cookie is a tiny data file, which resides on your computer and allows Punchbowl, Inc. to recognize you as a member when you return to Punchbowl from the same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register with Punchbowl, a cookie helps Punchbowl, Inc. to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to Punchbowl, the information you previously provided can be retrieved.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Punchbowl services.
Security of Your Personal Information
Punchbowl, Inc. secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Punchbowl, Inc. secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
How You Can Control Your Personal Information
You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:
If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at privacy@punchbowl.com.
If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from Punchbowl, Inc. please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of all of our emails.
If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please email at privacy@punchbowl.com. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect. You may also request that we delete the information we have collected about you at any time by emailing us at privacy@punchbowl.com. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may not be able to completely remove your information from our systems. For example, we may retain your information for legitimate business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law or as retained in our data backup systems or cached or archived pages, or where the burden or expense of accommodating your request would, in our good faith judgment, be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of others may be violated. All retained personal information will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has previously agreed.
Finally, you may request access to the information we have collected about you by sending a request to privacy@punchbowl.com.
