A combination of a Cookie-ID and personal data of the user (e.g. name, email address etc.) and thus a direct attribution of the information collected by or stored in the cookie to a certain user only takes place if the user has given his unambiguous prior consent.. For example, in order to facilitate secure online access so that you do not have to retype your user ID and password each time you visit the site, your user ID and password can be saved in cookies to make logging in to our website easier and faster.
