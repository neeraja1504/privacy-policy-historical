We care about transparency. Some websites hide their practices from their customers and visitors. We prefer honesty.
As online shoppers ourselves, relevant and personalized ads or emails are always more interesting than irrelevant ads or emails. In order to power relevant, interest-based content and advertisements for you, we need partners to help us identify you when you interact with us. Our partners may collect non-personal information like your IP address, device ID, shopping behavior, and information about your browser or operating system. We may share information about you such as your email or other identifiers with our partners. If we do, we always share it in a non-human-readable form to ensure the security of your information. Our partners may combine our personal and non-personal information about you with information from other sources, and may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, all to help us communicate better with you.
We also care about choice. You can opt-out of these services at any time. To opt-out of BouncePilot’s services, please go to http://BouncePilot.com/opt-out/.
