Puzzel as a data controller
When Puzzel determines the purpose and means of data processing we act as data controller. Puzzel controls Personal Data that we collect in the context of you being employed by a Customer that has or may have a business relation to Puzzel, or you declare that you want to receive information from us based on your own or your employer’s interests. When you represent a Customer of Puzzel, your rights are the same as if you were a private person only representing yourself.
Why do we collect and use personal data?
To manage our Customer relations in general and to meet our Customer commitments, Puzzel requires some information about you in your role as Customer contact person or user of a service. We also collect data about suppliers and partners for the following purposes:
a) Perform deliveries in accordance with a customer agreement
b) Offer support to users of our services
c) Improve the quality of our services and Puzzel Sites
d) Detect and prevent security threats and perform maintenance and debugging
e) Prevent abuse of our software and services
f) Communicate information that is relevant for our deliveries and our customer relations in general
g) Process orders, invoicing, payments and other financial follow up of Customers
h) Payment of services purchased through Puzzel Sites
Processing according to the above listed purposes (a to h) is necessary for us to manage our customer relations. Therefore, Puzzel does not, as additional ground ask for your consent to process your Personal Data. We do not consider that the processing disadvantages you in any way. We will also collect information about you as a contact person or user of a service. We collect and use Personal Data mainly to perform direct sales, direct marketing and customer service, including:
i) To manage your access to our web-based services (cloud services)
j) Send you marketing communications which you have requested. These may include information about our products and services, events, activities, and promotions of our associated partners’ products and services. This communication is subscription based and requires your consent.
k) Send you information about the products and services that you have purchased from us or are related to the services you are already using
l) Perform direct sales activities in cases where legitimate and mutual interest is established.
m) Provide you content and venue details on a webinar or event you signed up for.
m) Reply to a ‘Contact me’ or other web forms you have completed on one of our Puzzel websites (e.g. to download a whitepaper).
The basis for Puzzel’s processing of Personal Data for the above purposes (i) is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. Your consent may be given freely on Puzzel Sites when applicable. Please note that the collection of individual Personal Data is required to gain user access to many of our programs and services and to access the information you have requested.
To protect your security and ours we will also store information about you when you visit our premises. You will be informed of your rights in this context when you register in our electronic visitor system.
When do we collect your personal data?
In general, Puzzel collects data directly from you or other persons linked to the Customer company where you are employed. These persons may be a manager or colleague. If the Customer you work for purchases Puzzel services via a Puzzel partner company, we may collect information about you from the partner company.
We collect your Personal Data when you interact with us in person, through correspondence, by phone, by social media, or through our websites.
We will also, with your consent, use cookies and other tracking technology when you use Puzzel Sites to optimize your experience of these. Please see the paragraph describing automatic data collection tools for more information about these technologies and your rights in this context.
In some cases, we may also collect information about you from other legitimate sources if you have given your consent that the party collecting the Personal Data may share this with others. These sources may be third-party data aggregators, Puzzel’s marketing partners, public sources or third-party social networks. Puzzel will be able to combine Personal Data about you obtained from one source with data obtained from another source. This gives us a more complete picture of you as contact person, which also gives us the possibility of serving you in a more relevant way with a greater degree of personalisation.

Puzzel as a data processor
Puzzel provides different services to our Customers. These services involve processing of the Customers’ data and may include processing of Personal Data. The purpose of this processing is determined by our Customers and not by Puzzel. The Customer is then the data controller for the data subject’s data. Puzzel does in such cases act as data processor and process the data on behalf of and according to instructions given by the Customer. When acting as data processor, Puzzel is in accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) committed to enter into a data processing agreement (DPA) with the Customer. The Customer has agreed and guaranteed that:
The Customer is the owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer the data to Puzzel for processing and has the responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, content, reliability and legality of the Personal Data
It is the Customer’s duty as data controller to notify, to the extent required by applicable law, the relevant supervisory authorities and/or the data subject in the event of any breach or unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data
Customer complies with applicable legal requirements for privacy, data protection, and confidentiality of communications related to its use of Puzzel Cloud Services
Customer Data Processing
When acting as data processor, Puzzel is responsible for providing technical and organizational security measures to safeguard your privacy on behalf of our Customer – the data controller.
As data processor, Puzzel will not process Personal Data in any other manner or for any other purpose than authorized in the agreement with the data controller. Customer Data will be used only to provide Customer the Puzzel Cloud Services. This may include troubleshooting aimed at preventing, detecting and repairing problems affecting the operation of the Puzzel Cloud Services and the improvement of features that involve the detection of, and protection against, emerging and evolving threats to End-Users (such as malware or spam).
Data subjects having questions, comments, claims or any other issues regarding their Personal Data that Puzzel is data processor for, must submit these to the data controller.
As data processor, Puzzel will not give any data subjects access to their Personal Data without instructions given by the data controller to do so.
If governmental authorities or the police request disclosure of Personal Data, Puzzel will redirect the request to the data controller. As part of this effort, Puzzel may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the contacting agency.
Puzzel will provide non-public information about internal systems and routines for data processing to Customers and collaboration partners upon request and NDA.
