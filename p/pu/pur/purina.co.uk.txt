7. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Nestlé takes every reasonable step to ensure that your personal data are only processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. The criteria for determining the retention period for your Personal Data are:
(a) Nestlé will retain copies of your Personal Data in a form that allows for identification only for as long as:
(i) We maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g. where you are included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed)
(ii) Your Personal Data are necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and we have a valid legal basis,
(b) The duration of:
(i) any applicable limitation period (i.e. any period during which a person could bring a legal claim against us), and
(ii) an additional 2 months following the end of the applicable limitation period (so we are able to identify any personal data of a person who may bring a claim at the end of the applicable period),
(c) In addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your Personal Data for such additional time necessary in connection with that claim.
During the periods noted in paragraphs b (i) and b (ii) above, we will restrict our processing of your Personal Data to storage or, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent the data need to be reviewed in connection with any claim, or any obligation under applicable law.
Once the periods in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either
(i) permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Data or
(ii) anonymise the relevant Personal Data.
8. DISCLOSURE, STORAGE AND/OR TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
