5. Cookies
We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites. For more information see our Cookies Policy.
We use certain cookies, as described in our Cookies Policy and here in our Privacy Policy, that you agree to when you use our website and, in the case of some cookies, for legitimate interests of delivering and optimizing our services (where the cookie delivers essential functionality). Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users. Each cookie expires after a certain period of time, depending on what we use it for. We use cookies and similar technologies for several reasons:
To make our site easier to use
Creators and Users, if you use the “Remember me” feature when you sign into your account, we store your username and companyID in a cookie to make it quicker for you to sign in whenever you return to PurelyHR.
For security reasons
We use cookies to authenticate your identity and confirm whether you are currently logged into PurelyHR or determine if an incident impacts you.
To advertise to you
We, or our service providers and other third parties we work with, place cookies when you visit our website and other websites or when you open emails that we send you, in order to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective. If you don’t want to receive ads that are tailored to you based on your online activity, you may "opt out" of many of the companies that are involved in such tailoring by going to https://www.aboutads.info, https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ or, if you’re located in the European Union, at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu. Opting out in this way does not mean you will not receive any ads; it just means that you will not receive ads from such companies that have been tailored to you based on your activities and inferred preferences.
Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a website monitoring tool that allows users to see volumes of website visitors, their source, and to analyse how the content of their website is viewed and navigated. Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google Analytics tracking. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on : https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
6. Security

7. Data Retention
If you are a Creator and hold an account with PurelyHR, we do not delete the data in your account – you are responsible for and control the time periods for which you retain this data. There are controls in your account where you can delete data at a User level.
If you are a Creator, we also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
If you are a User (employee), you will need to ask the Creator (your data controller) how long your data will be stored in our services.
8. Safety of Minors
Our services are not intended for and may not be used by minors. “Minors” are individuals under the age of 13 (or under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence). PurelyHR does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact customer support.
9. Changes to our Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will notify account holders of significant changes in the way we treat any personal information, by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your PurelyHR account. We may also place a prominent notice on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
