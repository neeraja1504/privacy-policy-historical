6. COOKIES
We may use cookies in the operation of the Services. A 'cookie' is a small data file that sites often store on your computer's hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Services send cookies to your computer when you access or view content of the Services. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Services easier to use. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser settings to prevent this or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Please understand that if you decide not to accept cookies from us, this may reduce your experience when you use our Services.
7. THIRD PARTY
The Services may contain links to other web sites and/or applications including but not limited to advertising sites. The fact that the Services link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that we endorse or authorize that third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave our Services you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of the third party on its site, we cannot guarantee that the third party will adhere to the same privacy policy as Playdog Soft. We are in no way responsible for the privacy policy of the third party to which you chose to access from the Services. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.
8. SECURITY
We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Data without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@purplekiwii.com.
