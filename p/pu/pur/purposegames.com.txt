PurposeGames - Privacy Policy - PurposeGames
Effective May 21, 2018
PurposeGames.com is a site that allows its user to contribute content. When doing so, we demand that anyone who creates games, challenges, or other services offered on the site, registers with the site. For anything and everything else, you can stay unregistered and completely anonymous should you wish to do so.
Your privacy is critically important to us. At PurposeGames we have a few fundamental principles
For just visiting our site and playing our games, we do not ask you for personal information. Ever. If you want to create your own games we need to ask for your e-mail address, and we allow for you to disclose a bit more about yourself in your profile pages, but such information is completely optional.
Should you have given us any information, we don’t share your such information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
In our gaming engines, creating games, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, kept private, and permanently deleted. However, we do not control search engines out there so we cannot guarantee what will show up when people search for your games on search engines on the internet.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, PurposeGames collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PurposeGames' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PurposeGames’ visitors use its website. From time to time, PurposeGames may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Aside from the geo-location, e-mail, and movement pattern on the site, we do not collect nor use any other information provided by you as a user. We will never share your e-mail address with anyone. We may, on occasion, contact you via your e-mail address with information about the PurposeGames services.
We use Google Analytics and Google's Advertising Products. To get a complete picture of what they are collecting, please view How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps
PurposeGames collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on PurposeGames.com. We never share that data unless we are provided to do so by law. The reasons for logging such data is to provide a secure environment for as many as possibly, thereby giving us the possibility to block any wrong doers, based on the IP from which they are connecting to PurposeGames.com.
