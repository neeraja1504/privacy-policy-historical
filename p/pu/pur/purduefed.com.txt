What You Can Do to Help Protect Your Privacy
Purdue Federal Credit Union is committed to protecting the privacy of its members. Members can help by following these simple guidelines:
Protect your account numbers, card numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers) and passwords. Never keep your PIN with your debit or credit card, which can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.
Use caution when disclosing your account information, Social Security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you, explains the call is on behalf of the credit union and asks for your account information you should beware. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
Keep your information with us current. It is important that we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately. If your address or phone numbers change, please let us know.
