PureLocal - PureLocal
At PureLocal we appreciate your privacy and hope that you feel comfortable trusting us. PureLocal provides a comparison shopping service that enables consumers to compare prices, products and stores when they shop online. We believe that you have a right to know what information we collect, how we intend to use that information, whom we intend to share it with, and what measures we take to keep that information secure.
Collecting Your Information
We collect information at several stages during your interaction with PureLocal. When you first enter our site, we note your IP address and time of your visit. As you browse the site, we record your zipcode via a cookie so we can serve more location specific information on your next visit. We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies do not recognise you as a person, just your computer.

Third Party Advertising
We work with third parties who use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Web site and other sites. This information may be used to provide you with better shopping or savings opportunities through advertisements on this and other Web sites that you visit, or to conduct market research and website analysis.
User Submitted Reviews
We discourage you from entering any personal information and please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. It is not required for you to submit personally identifiable information to enable you to submit a review.
