Privacy Policy
We at Project for Public Spaces (PPS) hold ourselves to high standards of privacy for our contacts and website users. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach and what this means for you, a user of our website and resources.
What data is PPS collecting?
PPS only gathers data about its users when it is voluntarily given through forms and submissions. In our web analytics practices, we also collect information about our website, social media, and newsletter users/subscribers, including IP address, pages visited, time of visits, and other relevant measures. This is used in order for us to make strategic communications decisions in providing valuable content to our audience.
Where do we keep this data?
PPS is based in New York City, in the United States, which means that all data collected by PPS is subject to the laws and regulations of the United States.
For what purposes are we using this data?
User information is used primarily for communications purposes (including newsletters and email updates), as well as donor and job application records.
Do we share this information?
We do not, and will not share or trade information with any third parties.
Data Security
We care about the security of your data. That is why...
Your access to data, and your choices
If you no longer wish to receive content from PPS, you may, at any time, request that your name and contact information be omitted from our lists by submitting this information to the email address at the end of this document.
Anything else?
Our sites frequently link to partner links and other web addresses. When you click on one of these links, you are leaving PPS web properties and entering another site governed by the privacy policies of another organization, company, or institution.
In the future, we may modify this policy to reflect changing data privacy measures and regulations. We will be sure to share any changes here and through appropriate channels (i.e. newsletters), at the time they are made.
