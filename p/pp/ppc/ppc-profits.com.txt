We have written this policy with you in mind.  We want you to feel confident in our services and we take handling personal information very seriously. If at any point you feel we have failed to adhere to our privacy policy please contact us in writing at My House Sell, 4a Front Street, Stockton on Tees, TS21 3AT.
Disclosure of Information
The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) was enacted in the United Kingdom so the country was able to comply with the European Union directive on data protection published in 1995.  More information on the Data Protection Act 1998 can be found here (link to https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act)
The DPA 1998 is the defining act in UK Law governing the processing of data on identifiable living people.  Put simply, it sets out how your personal information should be protected by those that have it.
Grant and Co Consultants Ltd is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and complies completely with the entire act. We are extremely careful in protecting against unauthorised access, use, distribution or dissemination of any of your personal information.
The My House Sell team, contractors working on our behalf and any authorised agents have a duty of care to keep your information completely confidential.  Your information will only be used in relation to offering you the best possible service for the reason we are connected.
Unless you have given us express permission, your personal information (e.g. name, address, telephone number, email address etc) will not be passed or sold to any third party organisation for any reason (i.e. marketing, sales generation etc).  We will only use your information for the purposes to which you have agreed.
The Internet does not provide a completely secure medium in which to operate.  To maximise the protection of your personal data however we have a number of measures in place to offer the highest security possible.  These measures include password protection on all computers, laptops, tablets and phones that are able to access your information, internet security software preventing spyware, malware and any other form of destructive or data capture virus, data backup measures and firewalls.
Personal Information
To use our website, www.myhousesell.co.uk, you do not need to register with us.  That said, we would like to be able to assist you in the quickest way possible with your enquiry.  In order for us to do this we would encourage you to register your enquiry with us and allow us to contact you to discuss further.
Once you have entered your enquiry on the website and completed the basic information we are in a stronger position to be able to help you.  The reason we ask for the questions is not to invade your privacy but to give us a clearer indication of your situation and allowing us to offer the best solution for you.  By registering your enquiry with My House Sell you are authorising us to use your personal information as set out in this policy.
If you do not register with us, the personal data collected is minimal and generally takes the form of a cookie.
If your personal information changes, for example if you change your name or telephone number, please let us know by emailing info@myhousesell.co.uk.
