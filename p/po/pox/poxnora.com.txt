Users may modify or delete any Personal Information that is incorrect. Users can also withdraw their consent for us to use their Personal Information in a specified manner, send them certain communications from time to time and to share their Personal Information with third parties, provided they give us reasonable notice of the withdrawal.

VII. How do we protect personal information and keep it up-to-date?
Our Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information. During sessions in which Users give us sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, we encrypt transmissions using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Even a Users account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. This helps guard against interception of the information while it is on the Internet. We keep Personal Information on servers that are protected by firewalls and other technological means against intrusion or unauthorized access. The servers are located in a physically secure facility, and only persons with a need to know the information are given access. At the same time, we rely on Users to select passwords that cannot be easily guessed and guard them against disclosure, and promptly report any security problems to us. It is important to sign off when finished using a shared computer or one that is otherwise accessible to third parties. You must promptly notify us if your user name or password is lost or stolen or used without your permission. In such an event, we have the right at our discretion to cancel that user name or password and update our records accordingly.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be assured to be absolutely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet. Still, you can have a high degree of confidence that the Personal Information you give us is protected from unauthorized access and use.
We rely on Users for the accuracy of the Personal Information they provide, and we do our best to ensure that the Personal Information we use on an ongoing basis is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Should you find that any of your Personal Information which we have is out of date or inaccurate, please contact us at customercare@desertowl.com.
VIII. Links to third party web sites and third party advertisements
Our Site may contain hyperlinks to other Internet web sites or third party advertisements.
