Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may use “cookies” on or in connection with our Site to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. When you visit our Site, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Site will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Site to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Site or certain areas or features of our Site. A more detailed explanation of our cookie policy can be found here.
Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Site; the website you visit after this Site; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Your IP address can also be used for moderation purposes, in order to limit the creation of multiple accounts and SPAM prevention.
When you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make the Site better for our users.
Special Promotions Privacy Terms

Specifically, the personal information that may be collected in connection with our Promotions includes a user's name, surname, room nickname (i.e. the nickname the user gives him/herself in connection with the specific Promotion), email address, and country of residence. In addition, in certain Promotions as well as in certain cases in which further verification procedures so require, a user may also be asked to provide a telephone number and a facial photograph together with the user's ID.
PokerWorks may disclose the personal information described above to such third parties with whom PokerWorks partners in connection with the Promotions.
Confidentiality

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Limits of Confidentiality
Due to the legal, regulatory and security environment in which we operate, PokerWorks may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose personally identifiable information of our users and we may not be permitted to inform you that we have done so. PokerWorks will use reasonable endeavours to limit such disclosure where PokerWorks believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena, warrant or other legal process, or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce PokerWorks' rights. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your user identification information to third party agents of PokerWorks or official government bodies as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to legal liability.
