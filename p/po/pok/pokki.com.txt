SweetLabs, Inc. (“we” or “our” or “SweetLabs”) welcomes you to our websites, software, products, and services. We understand that you care about your privacy, and we take your privacy seriously. To inform you about the ways your information may be collected and used, we have adopted this privacy policy (the “SweetLabs Privacy Policy”), which describes what types of information we collect, how we may use such information, with whom we may share such information, the choices you can make, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
1. What our Privacy Policy covers
This SweetLabs Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information we collect when you are accessing our websites, software, products, and services (our “Services”) owned and operated by SweetLabs which post, include or link to this SweetLabs Privacy Policy. By using, downloading, installing or visiting our Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this SweetLabs Privacy Policy.
This policy also explains your choices with regard to how we use the information about you. Your choices include how you can request access, update or object to certain uses of information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our services or interact with any other aspect of our business.
Please note this policy does not apply to (and we are not responsible for) the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to individuals we do not employ or manage. When utilizing third party sites or software products, including apps that may be available through our Service, provided by third parties, or by using Services that access or utilize third party sites or services, you should read the relevant privacy policies of those third parties for information regarding their privacy practices.
2. Information we collect
We collect different types of information from or through our Services when you provide it to us, when you use our services, and when other sources provide it to us, as described below.
We apply a privacy by design approach which includes collecting and processing non-personally identifiable information which may be collected in conjunction with a random, unique identifier to assist us in ensuring effective measurement and reporting internally and to our business partners using aggregate analytics and summary trend reporting. In order to further protect your privacy, we do not store internet protocol addresses (“IP addresses”) and any pseudonymous identifiers required to complete transactions are manipulated at the end of the collection activity so that data stored cannot be used to directly identify you.
a. Information you provide to us
When you use the Service either with an account or by directly interacting with the Service without an account as a user or as a visitor, you may provide and we may collect information about you. Examples of information you may provide include name and email address which are collected when registering and posting in our support portal.
b. Information we automatically collect about you
Use of the Services : We collect certain information when you visit, use, or interact with any of our Services. This information includes features you use, links you click, pages you view, apps you install through our Services, searches you perform, and otherwise how you may interact with our Services.
Our Services automatically collect usage information regarding our software and Services you use, such as the frequency with which the Service has been clicked or opened, and how long the Service remains open. We also collect installation information, which may include information on whether Services have been installed or uninstalled, and how long a Service has been installed or used on your system.
Device and Connection Information : We automatically record certain information from your device or software on your device. This automatically collected information may include IP addresses which are used to determine your country of origin, other unique device identifiers including cookie IDs, web browser type, device type and origin, the web pages or sites visited prior to or immediately after using the website or Service, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or usage of the Service.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technology : When you visit our sites, we may store a cookie or other identifying information in your browser that allows us to uniquely identify it. We may also use other web beacon technologies to send a signal to another service with a unique cookie id in order to track impressions or views or usage of our Services. Where required by applicable law, we obtain your consent for the use of cookies. You may choose to delete or not accept our cookies or those from third parties which we employ, such as for analytics.
Our Services may use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information gathering technologies to collect standard internet log information and usage information such as the number and frequency of visitors, what pages have been visited, average time spent on pages, and other information which helps us determine which features in our Services are most important to you and working effectively.
We will not associate any information gathered from these tools with any information from any source. We will not use the information collected from these technologies to identify you. See our Cookie Policy for more information.
c. Information from other services
We may receive information about you from other third-party services. For example, we collect information from third party authentication services in connection with your use of them to access the Services.
3. How we use information we collect
We use the information we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:
a. Operations
We use the information to operate, maintain, and enhance all features of the Services, to provide the Services, and provide support to users of the Services.
b. Service/software improvements
We use the information to analyze and understand the usage trends and preferences to improve the Services and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
c. Communications
We may use a voluntarily provided email address or other contact methods you consent to provide to contact you for customer support, right of privacy inquiries, or other questions about the Services. The contact information may be used for such purposes as improving the content of our sites, customizing and improving our services, and communicating with you about our Services.
d. Security
We may use the information to research fraud claims, malicious, harmful, or illegal behaviors and activities, and respond, protect, or remediate any such behaviors or violations of our Service policies.
e. Usage information
We only use the usage information we collect in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure to allow us to improve our Services and provide summary reports to our partners for Services which we cooperate to provide. We do not store the information in our database in a manner in which the usage or Service information can identify you.
f. Legal bases for processing
If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your information, including your Personal Data (as defined in the GDPR). We will collect and process your information only if we have a lawful basis for doing so. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. Such as:
1. Contractual necessity
We may collect some information as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such information will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
2. Legitimate interest
We may collect and use your information (see the “Information We Automatically Collect” section) when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of SweetLabs or our business partners (which is not overridden by your data protection interests).
Examples of these legitimate interests include:
Operation and improvement of our business, products, and Services
Provision of customer support
Marketing of our products and services
Investigation and remediation of fraud, security threats, or malicious behavior
Protection of our legal rights and interests
Compliance of legal and contractual obligations
Completion of corporate transactions
3. Consent
In some cases, we process your information based on the consent you expressly granted at the time of collection for a specific purpose.
4. Other processing grounds
From time to time, we may be obligated to process your information to comply with a legal obligation, protection of the vital interests of users, or if it is a necessary task carried out in the public interest.
a. Non-personal information
We may make automatically-collected, aggregated, and otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties (our partners or affiliates) for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; or (ii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality available through the Services.
b. Personal information
We work with third party service providers who provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other infrastructure services. These third parties may have access to, or process your information as part of providing those services for us, such as IP addresses. We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to operate, and our contracts with them require them to maintain the confidentiality and security of such information.
Other than those service providers providing key services to us, SweetLabs does not share, sell, or market your information collected with third parties, such as ad technology, targeting, and user profiling platforms.
c. Business transfers
If SweetLabs or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that SweetLabs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that would be transferred to, or acquired by, a third party acquirer. We will use reasonable efforts to direct any acquirer to continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.
d. Where required by law
We may share your information if we have a good faith belief that it is required to: (1) comply with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; (2) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this SweetLabs Privacy Policy, the SweetLabs Terms of Service, and/or any other agreements between you and SweetLabs, including investigation of potential violations thereof; or (4) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of SweetLabs, its Services, and its visitors, users and/or the public.
5. How we protect your information
a. Data security
We take reasonable, industry accepted and appropriate security measures to guard against unauthorized access to the systems where we store your information. This includes technical and organizational measures such as internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical and electronic security measures in compliance with applicable security requirements. In addition, we authorize access to your information only by those of our employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
b. Data retention
We only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected and processed it, unless otherwise required by law or in the circumstance of an ongoing fraud or Service investigation. IP addresses, which are used to determine your country of origin, are not stored in our database and are deleted as soon as possible after processing. We will either delete or anonymize your information or if this is not possible then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. After your account is deleted or the software is uninstalled, we may retain some information in an anonymous or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.
6. Your rights
a. Opting out of collection of information
1. Websites and cookies
You may install or otherwise use cookie blocking techniques built into browsers or as browser add-ons to block cookies and services such as Google Analytics when visiting our websites. You may also choose to cease using or accessing our websites and Services. See our Cookie Policy for more information.
2. SweetLabs software, including Pokki and App Explorer
You may uninstall or cease using our software at any time. The software is simple to uninstall by visiting “Add/Remove Programs” or “Apps and Features” and removing all software made by SweetLabs or Pokki.
b. EU Residents
As mentioned above, if you are a resident of the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, the GDPR gives you a range of rights in connection with our processing of your information.
These rights include:
Access : You may request that we provide you with more information regarding the information we hold about you (and that we provide you with a copy of such information).
Rectification : You may request we rectify any of your information you think is inaccurate.
Erasure : You may request that we delete all or some of your information.
Restriction of processing : You may request further restrictions on the processing of your information.
Objection : Furthermore, you have the right to object against the processing based on our legitimate interests as a legal basis.
Data portability : You have the right to request your data in a machine-readable format. You may also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.
Withdrawal of consent : If we are processing your information based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
Right to file complaint : You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
We are required to assess and attempt to act on your request, though in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.

SweetLabs utilizes many technologies to provide our Services. Some of our Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) either directly through SweetLabs or our service providers. If you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside.
