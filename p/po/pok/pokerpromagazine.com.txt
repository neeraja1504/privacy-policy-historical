Cookies
A cookie is a small data file that certain sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of “how many” times customers are doing specific things, such as visiting the Website, without really knowing who those customers are. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. Additionally, after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don’t have to reenter it repeatedly during that session.
The Website cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for our sites. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information available on the Website).
