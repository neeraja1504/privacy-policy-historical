Pokerspace is a social network that allows its members to share information within the community. We believe that all members should have full control over their information and the way it’s shared. Therefore we have implemented a reasonable set of standard default settings which a User can easily adjust his/her preferences.
The Information We Collect
Top
Once you open an account you agree to sharing the information you provide with Pokerspace. We cannot delete accounts from Pokerspace. If, in the unfortunate circumstance, you would like to delete your account with Pokerspace, we would be happy to delete your details and suspend the account, but a complete deletion from Pokerspace history is not possible.
When you visit Pokerspace you provide us with two types of information: personal information that you knowingly choose to disclose and information collected as you interact with the Pokerspace platform.
When you register with Pokerspace, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information that you choose to provide to us.
When you use Pokerspace, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.
You post User Content (as defined in the Pokerspace Terms and Conditions) on the site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.
Pokerspace may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other Users of the Pokerspace service through the operation of the service in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. By using Pokerspace, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in Canada.
Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Pokerspace is a violation of the Pokerspace Terms and Conditions and should be reported to privacy@Pokerspace.com
Minimum Age Requirement
Top
No one under the age of 18 is permitted to use Pokerspace.com or any of its affiliates and subsidiaries. In some cases the affiliates may have a higher minimum age requirement. For these sites their minimum age requirement overrides that of Pokerspace.
Use of Information Obtained by Pokerspace
Top
When you register with Pokerspace, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people allowed privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on Pokerspace. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Pokerspace that we think you may find valuable.
Profile information is used by Pokerspace primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your chatboard), other Pokerspace Users may be able to supplement your profile.
Your name, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Pokerspace network. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a buddy request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your networks, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.
Pokerspace may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or event invitation, or someone posts on your chatboard, you may receive an email alerting you of such requests.
Pokerspace may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions. You can know more about the world around you they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite poker website, we might post offers about this website so you’re update and connected to things you enjoy.
We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Pokerspace Platform developers and other Users of Pokerspace, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile.
Inviting Friends
Top
When inviting friends to join the site you may enter their email addresses directly, or use one of our import options to import friend's lists. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store any of your friend's email addresses if they decline your invitation and do not join the site. We do not store any other information you provide to import friend's lists or invite friends. Such information is provided only and directly to the program or website you have selected to import your contacts from.
As with any site that uses invitations and buddy lists, you should use care when disclosing your personal information to strangers. Be advised that if you send messages containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.
Email Notifications
Top
The following kinds of optional notifications may be sent to you by email, depending on your chosen preferences. The notifications can be configured by going to the “Preferences” page on Pokerspace. This functionality may not be available during the first release, but is a part of the Pokerspace product roadmap.

Message Notification: When someone writes you a new message
Poker Crew Notification: When someone invites to their crew
Event: When someone invites you to an event

We do not work or associate with research companies that are in the business of trading personal information.

Third-Party Advertisers

The ads appearing on Pokerspace are delivered to Users by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about your location, or others who are using your computer that saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Pokerspace, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
