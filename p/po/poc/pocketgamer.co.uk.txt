STORING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We will only retain and use your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes set out in this privacy
policy or as otherwise required by law.
Unfortunately the sending of information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be
intercepted. We cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically and therefore sending
such information is entirely at your own risk but once received, all information is stored on our secure servers and we
have in place a level of security appropriate to the nature of the information stored and the harm that might result from a
breach of security.
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to a destination outside the European Economic Area
("EEA"), where it will be stored by us or by one of our suppliers. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such suppliers and staff may be engaged in, among other things, the
provision of support services. We will take reasonable steps to ensure adequate security for any of your information
transferred outside the EEA, but please be aware that destinations outside the EEA to which your information may be
transferred may have data protection laws which do not offer the same level of protection for your information as those in
force in the EEA. By using our site and submitting your information to us, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing
of such information outside the EEA as set out in this privacy policy. By using the website and submitting your personal
