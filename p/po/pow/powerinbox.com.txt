DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Data subjects with respect to whose data GDPR applies, have rights under GDPR and local laws, including, in different circumstances, rights to: data portability, access data, rectify data, object to processing, and erase data. It is clarified for the removal of doubt, that where personal data is provided by a customer being the data subject’s employer, such data subject rights will have to be effected through that customer. In addition, data subject rights cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with the rights of PowerInbox employees and staff, with PowerInbox proprietary rights, and third-party rights. As such, job references, reviews, internal notes and assessments, documents and notes including proprietary information or forms of intellectual property, cannot be accessed or erased or rectified. In addition, these rights may not be exercisable where they relate to data that is not in a structured form, for example emails, or where other exemptions apply. If processing occurs based on consent, data subjects have a right to withdraw their consent. In any case, PowerInbox will not share your personal identifiable details with any advertisers without your consent.
If, for any reason, a data subject wishes to exercise these rights and modify, delete or retrieve their Personal Data, they may be able to do so by contacting PowerInbox (privacy@powerInbox.com). Note that PowerInbox has to undertake a process to identify a data subject exercising their rights. PowerInbox may keep details of such rights exercised for its own compliance and audit requirements.
