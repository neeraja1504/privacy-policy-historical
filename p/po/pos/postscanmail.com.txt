Types of Information Collected.  We collect two types of information from users of our Site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
1. Personally Identifiable Information.  This is information that identifies you as a specific customer or user of the Site. In order to access certain parts of the Site, you will be required to register as a user. During the registration process you may be asked to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address and password and your company information if applicable. For services such as online postal mail, we also request and store credit card or other payment account information, address and telephone information and physical copies of your identification papers. For services such as check processing and depositing, we will request and store information relating to your banking account and other sensitive information required to verify your identity, such as Social Security number, drivers license and/or Passport information.
All information will be maintained in encrypted form on secure servers or in secure physical facilities, as appropriate. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, such as personal interests, feedback, preferences, and recommendations, to help us customize the Site or our services and deliver personalized information to you. We may also supplement the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide with information we obtain from third parties such as Google, Bng, and Optimizely; in that case, we will treat the information from third parties the same as information we collected ourselves, and, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share that information with third parties.
2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Sometimes referred to as "technical information," this is information about you that we collect by means of Internet technologies, such as "cookies" (small pieces of information transferred from our Site and stored on your computer when you visit our Site), in order to determine how users reached the Site to and track user usage patterns during their visits. We use the information collected from cookies to improve the function, content, appearance, and capability of the Site.

We may also log IP addresses for system administration purposes. This information is used to diagnose server problems, monitor traffic patterns, analyze trends, administer the Site, track user patterns, and identify the most popular areas of the Site. IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information and are only used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, except in cases where fraud is suspected, or otherwise at the request of law enforcement agencies. We may also use technical methods in HTML emails sent to our users, in order to determine whether users have opened those emails and/or clicked on the links in those emails, or many an inquiry in response to an email. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable. We may also supplement this technical information with information we obtain from third parties such as Google, Bing, and Optimizely, in which case we will treat the third party information as though it were information we collected ourselves. That information will not be shared with third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
