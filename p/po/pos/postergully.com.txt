**    ** The Quick Read Version
Privacy : We won’t share your personal information with anyone. Chill! We ourselves get annoyed with junk/spam mails! Because we understand therefore we respect your privacy. We take extreme care with your details. At no time does even PosterGully have access to your credit card, debit card or any bank details, thus making your payment ultra secure.
Payment : We've partnered with India's leading Payment Gateway -  Direcpay  (Powered by Times Of India) for our online payments through Credit Card, Debit Card and Net Banking. We accept Visa, Mastercard & Diner's Club cards. You could also choose the  Cash on delivery (COD)  option to pay for your orders. Please read about our COD policies to know more.
Stock Policy : If the product becomes out of stock, we de-list it from the website asap. But to err is human and technology can screw things up once in a blue moon. So God forbid, but if we receive an order for an out of stock product, we’ll try our level best to get it for you within three business days and if unfortunately we can’t, you’ll have your money back and something more.
Delivery : Our goods are delivered by Bluedart & Aramex, world's leading logistics companies. However, it is extremely difficult for us to accept responsibility for their service. If your goods are not received within our specified delivery dates then you must notify us within 10 days. Please read our shipping policies to know more.
Prices : We can deal with inflation! Sigh But, in cases of hyperinflation, we reserve the right to change our prices. We will not change the price of an order you have already made without prior notification. Any unlikely occurrences will be dealt with at our discretion.
Packaging _:  _All posters, merchandise & art prints are wrapped in bubble wrap, packed securely in a mail tube! Because we are customers ourselves, we know how frustrating it can be when the packaging is not quite right.
International Copyright Laws : The arrangement and compilation of all Website Content is our exclusive property and is protected by international copyright laws.

The security of your personal information is important to us at PosterGully.com.

For purchases of posters, prints and merchandise made online with credit cards, the payment gateway stores your card number in encrypted form for a limited amount of time, and our employees at PosterGully.com do not have access to this information. We do not store PIN data or 3-digit security codes.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we try our best to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.
