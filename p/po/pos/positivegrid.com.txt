How do we share your data?
We may engage and contract with third party companies (e.g. service providers) to provide services that help us with our business activities such as cloud hosting services. These third party service providers are limited to only using information as instructed to provide contracted services to us.
We may also disclose your personal information:
As required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

How will the data be used?
GENERAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH DATA ARE USED
All personal data acquired and/or requested, either prior to or during the course of contractual relationship, will be used to fulfill your requirements, ensuring that the contractual obligations are met and administrative and legal obligations are provided correctly by the company Positive Grid, thereby allowing the business activities associated to its objectives to be conducted as efficiently as possible. The supply of data is not mandatory but is necessary in order to set up and execute this agreement; refusal to provide such data may therefore prevent the company from establishing a working relationship with you. Furthermore, your non-sensitive personal data provided with your express consent, revocable at any time, has been obtained, for the following additional uses:
Inclusion in Positive Grid’s databases for the purpose of sending business notices/information relating to commercial activities conducted by Positive Grid.
Use for statistical purposes in connection with promotional campaigns.
Circulating of personal data, including in the form of images and/or videos within the company’s official website.
PROCESSING METHODS
Data will be processed using appropriate methods and tools that guarantee their confidentiality and may be processed using electronic or automated means (network data processing systems not accessible to the public) and using non-automated means (paper-based archives and records), both protected by appropriate security measures such as personalised passwords offering exclusive access, personal identity codes and limited access to records.
Certain types of data that are considered sensitive by the law (such as data capable of revealing racial and ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or other convictions, political opinion, membership of political parties, trade unions, associations or organisations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade union nature, as well as personal data capable of revealing state of health or sexual activities), which we could be made aware, after being informed by yourself or after having processed documents furnished by you, at the start up or during the course of a working relationship with our Company, may only be used with your prior written consent.
TRANSFER OF DATA
Personal data supplied may not be transferred by our Company, except
Only in the circumstances outlined by law, for the purpose of supplying the service requested and/or executing the agreement, in order to fulfill administrative, accounting and/or fiscal obligations referred to under point 1). In such circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request;
Solely to outside associates of the company Positive Grid, acting as tax and/or accountancy consultants, for the performance of the tasks described under point 1). Again, in these circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request;
To subsidiary companies and/or companies in which shares are held, sales networks (agents, dealers, collaborators and/or distributors), customer service and support agents, sub-suppliers and sub-contractors involved in conducting agreement / contractual or business relations.
How do we protect our customer’s data?
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place appropriate technical, physical and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you.
How long will the data be stored for?
We will retain your information for as long as you maintain a GDPR Readiness Assessment account (if you are an EU user) with us and have not otherwise requested us to delete your information.
Access to your information, correction, portability and deletion
You are in complete control. You can object or withdraw your consent to the use of your personal data at any time.
Subject to some legal exemptions, you have the right to:
Request a copy of the personal information Positive Grid holds about you;
To have any inaccuracies corrected;
To have your personal data erased;
To place a restriction on our processing of your data;
To object to processing; and
