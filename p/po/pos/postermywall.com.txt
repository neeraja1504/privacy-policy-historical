But first, a note about uploading and posting information on the 250 Mils Website:

Additionally, if your comment or message contains personal information and is posted by you in a page that is accessible to the public, third parties may make note of the information and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result. Any content or information you upload is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy. Always use care when you post such information.

Information Collected by Cookies:

A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users. 250 Mils Websiteâ€šs cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. If you reset your browser, some of the 250 Mils Website features and functionality may not be available to you.
Information Collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:

How do we secure your information?
When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. The secure server software (SSL) we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your 250 Mils account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select.
We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with us, you agree to this privacy policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to the United States.

communicate with you about the status of your orders and other inquiries about our products and services;
send you information about our products and services; and

We use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages and notifications from time-to-time. You may unsubscribe or change the frequency of email notifications on the Profile Settings page in "Edit Profile".
If you email a product to a friend or refer a friend to the 250 Mils Website or our promotions, we will use your friend's email to send them the e-mail you requested. Your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted.

Does 250 Mils disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

250 Mils provides information to its agents and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, such as: fulfilling customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering certain products and services; communicating with customers; providing customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the 250 Mils Website features and functionality. In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our privacy policy.
If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information (such as your name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties.
250 Mils may also release information (including your name, addresses, telephone number, and account activity) when we, in our sole discretion believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to:

investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity;

250 Mils may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.
What about Children's Privacy?
Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent. To order products, the child must indicate his or her age, submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number
This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including royalty entitlements and pay royalty fees, if any, to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service, and to advise the child concerning new 250 Mils products, services or policies.
Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not. Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by 250 Mils to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order.
