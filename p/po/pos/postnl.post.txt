As a rule, we do not share your data with any individuals or organisations outside PostNL, except when this is necessary to provide the service we have promised you, for example if you are using our Relocation Service.

How long do we store your data?
We generally do not retain your data any longer than necessary. How long we keep your data depends on the following factors:
For what purpose do we store your data?
How long are we required by law to store the data?
How do we protect your personal data?
We seek to treat your data with the highest level of security in the following ways:
We spend a significant amount of time and money on protecting our systems containing personal data. We have a specific department for this purpose: Cybersecurity.
If there is a problem involving our security, causing people outside PostNL to be able to view the personal data, or if there is a situation which creates a risk of the data being compromised, we make a record of this and handle the situation with care. We report these incidents to the regulator, and, if necessary, to you.
Only employees who require access to your data can view this data. All our employees have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which remains in force even after they have left the company.
Our data processing operations are supervised by two organisations and a dedicated Data Protection Officer:
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) monitors whether we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.
The Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM) monitors whether we deal appropriately with:
Cookies
Direct marketing
The National Do Not Call Registry (bel-me-niet-register)
The Data Protection Officer monitors whether PostNL handles personal data appropriately, and its legal duties are provided for under the law. The Data Protection Officer reports directly to the management board. If you have any questions for the Data Protection Officer, please send an e-mail to: fg@postnl.nl.
