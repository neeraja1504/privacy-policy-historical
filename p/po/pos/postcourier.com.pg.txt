Personal Information
We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information. We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents. We may automatically collect personal information by collecting and tracking the unique device identifier or the universally unique identifier of the devices you use to access our services.
Use of Information
We usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it.
We use your information to provide our services (which on digital platforms may include the display of personalised content and advertising) to you, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication.

Post-Courier may disclose your information to its service providers (including technical infrastructure providers) and contractors (including mail houses or debt collection agencies) from time to time but only to help us to provide and market our goods and services to you. We may also share your information with third parties who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers. If we do any of these, we generally require the third parties to protect your information at least to the same degree that we do.
If you have consented to us doing so, Post-Courier may also share your information with a third party for the purpose of enabling those third parties to contact you with marketing messages.
