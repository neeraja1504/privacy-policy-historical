The Post Chronicle - Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY
Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to Post Chronicle. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find below a description of how Post Chronicle strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.
User Information
Post Chronicle does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties unless you specifically send us that information. If you fill out any form on the website or send an e-mail as a response to any article, your comments become public domain and we reserve the right to print or not print them.
The Post Chronicle does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Post Chronicle servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of protecting those who utilize the Post Chronicle Network.
The Cookie Principle
Post Chronicle may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience. When you first visit Post Chronicle, Post Chronicle may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the services we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you visit...thus enhancing your online web viewing experience. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.
DoubleClick DART cookie:
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Interest-Based Advertising
Interest-based advertising by Google will allow advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, Google will recognize the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, we will add them to the "sports enthusiast" interest category.
For Web Publisher Members of Post Chronicle
