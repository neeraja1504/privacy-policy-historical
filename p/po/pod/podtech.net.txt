Podtech Privacy Policy
Effective May 7, 2007
PodTech.net and PodTech Network, Inc. (collectively, “PodTech”) is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. While you can use many features of PodTech anonymously, you may be required to provide personal information in some instances to access certain features.
PodTech provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.podtech.net (this "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our PodTech Terms of Use.
As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information from users are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.
Personally Identifiable Information
When you post a response to content on the Site (“Comment”) or send a video by email (“Email”) we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This is information about you that when on its own, or in combination with other identifiers, can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and email address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. Your Comments are visible to all viewers of our Site.
We also collect other non-identifying information through your use of the PodTech Player (e.g. user activity, the pages of the site that you visit, time spent on these pages and other statistics) (“Non-Identifying Information”).
We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.
Cookies
While PodTech does not use "cookies" to collect information, third party advertisers on the Site may place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the third party advertisers' websites or all the functionalities of their services.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information with, and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information to, third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. PodTech cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of PodTech or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
