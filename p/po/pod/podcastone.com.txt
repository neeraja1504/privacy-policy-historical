VII. Advertising/Behavioral Targeting: How To Opt Out:
We license and/or utilize technology to serve advertisements on our own Platforms and within content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, we may also use third party ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Platforms, as well as third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our Platforms and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these providers unless you have expressly authorized us to do so, but they, like other advertising service vendors, may place and access cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive or flash memory or other form of storage of your Device to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on these Platforms and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-personal data such as Web pages you have visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other Usage Information. We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Platforms and other websites. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the TRUSTe Preference Manager at http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The TRUSTe Preference Manager provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides a mechanism to opt out of receiving cookies from those companies.

PodcastOne uses e-mail to send announcements regarding new products, services, and/or promotions, and informational newsletters. Announcements via email are on an opt-in basis only.
