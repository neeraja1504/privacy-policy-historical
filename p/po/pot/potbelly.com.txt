Privacy Notice
(Updated November 4, 2016)
Thank you for visiting Potbelly.com. Potbelly knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by our Websites, including our mobile websites and our mobile apps. By visiting Potbelly.com or using one of our mobile apps, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect
We only collect personally identifiable information about you when you provide it voluntarily, by entering information on our Website, through our mobile apps or giving information to us in another way. For example, personal information may be collected when you order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion or subscribe to one of our services. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The types of personally identifiable information that we may collect include: name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, birthday and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services.
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated data and anonymized data. For example, Potbelly may automatically collect website use information about the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system, domain name and information about your internet service provider.
How We Use the Information
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We do not sell, transfer or disclose your personal information to any third parties other than for the limited purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs and services. With your permission, we may also use the information to communicate with you about our promotional offers, events or for other marketing purposes.
We may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as providing technical services to our Websites) and that help us market our products. We share information with these companies only if they need it to perform their functions on our behalf and require them to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Potbelly may disclose personal information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. In addition, we reserve the right to use and disclose your personal and non-personal information in order to (i) enforce our agreements, corporate policies and terms of use; or (ii) to protect the rights, property of Potbelly, our employees, agents, customers and others.
In the event of a merger, acquisition, financing or sale of assets or any other situation involving the transfer of some of all of our business assets, Potbelly may disclose your personal information to those involved in the negotiation or transfer.
