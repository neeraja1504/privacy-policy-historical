What information does Pooltracker collect, and how is it used?
When you visit the Pooltracker.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then collate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.
On some pages (our Members Area), you can register and order services, make requests, and invite others to join. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order, to send you reminder notices to make your picks and to send you promotions for upcoming tournaments and to use it internally for statistical reasons. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Credit Card Processing and Security
Shopping with Pooltracker is absolutely safe - you never have to worry about credit-card safety when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them.
Pooltracker uses the services of Authorize.net to provide the highest level of secure online transactions. Your credit card information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. Authorize.net maintains their own privacy and security policies. If you have questions about these services, or how they handle the information they receive, please contact Authorize.net.
All information you enter in the Authorize.net order form will be shared with Pooltracker in order to fulfill the purchased services. This does not apply to your credit card information. We never get your credit card number.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
