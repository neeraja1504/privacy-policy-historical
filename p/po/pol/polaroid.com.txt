If you are under 16 years of age, do not use this website, sign up for our newsletter, or provide any information about yourself to us, including without limitation your name, email address, postal address or location. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under the age of 16 has submitted personal information to us in connection with the website or otherwise, please email us at privacyconcern@polaroid.com so that we can take steps to delete the personal information as required in accordance with applicable law.
How long do we retain your personal information?
We will keep your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.

Our website provides links to third-party websites that we do not operate, control or maintain. Our website also may contain third-party ads. The third parties operating those websites and serving those ads have their own privacy practices and policies, and we are not responsible for their actions. For example, our website links to the “Polaroid Originals” website maintained at www.us.polaroidoriginals.com. That website is operated by one of our brand licensees, Impossible America Corp., which sells Polaroid Originals-branded products, and with whom we also have a marketing affiliate relationship. We do not operate the Polaroid Originals website and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of Impossible America, Corp. (its Privacy Policy may be found here). We urge you to read the privacy policies of all third-party websites and third-party advertisers to learn more about their privacy practices and policies.
