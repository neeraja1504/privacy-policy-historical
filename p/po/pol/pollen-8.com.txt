From time-to-time, we may request Personal Information from Pollen-8 members in connection with a contest or a sweepstakes. Participation in these contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any requested Personal Information.

We may collect Non-Personnel Information about you when you visit the Site, including IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, operating system, and other data collected from responding to a survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a form, or posting/responding to product campaigns.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will be kept on file for more than 60 days in order to enable ongoing use of your Pollen-8 membership.
Nonetheless, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
