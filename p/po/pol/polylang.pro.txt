Data shared with our support
All data that you share with our support team is stored in Helpscout.
Sometimes, to help our support to debug an issue on your site, we might ask you access to your FTP account of your site backend. We use this access strictly for debugging and do not share any data with anyone outside of the company. We recommend that you reset the passwords once you don’t need our support anymore. We cannot be held responsible for any loss of private information from databases if that should occur. We recommend that you have always a fully working backup of the site you share with us.
Data collected by our plugins
Polylang or the Polylang addons that we provide to you do not collect any personal data without your users’s consent. Polylang allows your user to translate their biographical info. It is considered as personal data and is exported with other personal data of your users.
Polylang does not send any data from your website to us. Polylang Pro and our other premium plugins collect your domain name an IP address when you activate your licence key. This information is used to enable the automatic updates.
Who we share your data with
We don’t share your data with third-parties in a way as to reveal any of your personal information except for payments.
We accept payments through PayPal. When processing payments, some of your data will be passed to PayPal, including information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and billing information. Please see the PayPal privacy policy for more details.
We also use Stripe for payment. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe privacy policy.

How long we retain your data
If you have an account, all personal data that we hold about you were collected for legal reasons. We must keep them at least 10 years.
