Our website www.policygenius.com (the “ Site ”) is owned and operated by Policygenius Inc. (“ Policygenius ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” and/or “ our ” as used in this Policy), which provides online insurance brokerage, insurance coverage quotes and estimates, and related services (the “ Services ”). This privacy policy (“ Privacy Policy ”) describes how we collect and use information from you when you use our Site or our Services, as well as how we secure it. By agreeing to our Terms of Service, you have consented to the data handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms that are used in this Privacy Policy but not defined here shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.
This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date specified above. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting a message on our home page. Your continued use of the Site or Services after any such chance will constitute your acceptance of any modified Privacy Policy.
What We Collect and How We Use It
You can use the Site by just browsing without logging in (as a “ Visitor ”) or by creating and maintaining an account to apply for and/or purchase one or more insurance policies through us (as a “ Member ”). Each of Visitors and Members may be referred to in this Privacy Policy by the terms “ you ” or “ your.” Our Services are only available to Members.
Site Visitors
From Visitors, whether or not they are, or become, Members, we collect: Information about the technical mechanisms you used to access the Site, such as your browser and operating system type, the link that brought you to our Site, data points that help our analytics function and which tell us what brought you to a particular spot on our Site, and Your IP address, which is automatically anonymized when used by our third party analytics services.
Collectively, this is “ Usage Information.”
We use Usage Information to inspect, analyze, and improve our Site and ensure it functions well with the technology used by our Visitors. In addition to analytics about the demographics of our Site Visitors, we use IP Addresses for Visitors not to individually identify you, but to confirm we can deliver the Site and Services to you based on local legal rules.
Insurance Checkup and Application
When you use the Site for an “Insurance Checkup,” you can choose to supply additional information about yourself to us, including your first name, last name, and email address. In order to receive results for our Personal Insurance Checkup, you will be required to provide us with additional personal information which includes, but is not limited to: your email address, zip code, marital status, employment status, risk tolerance, living situation details, property and vehicle ownership, family information such as number of children and number of pets, whether you are a homeowner or a renter, your income, amounts of your savings and debts, and general details about your current insurance coverage (collectively, “ Checkup Information ”) - we use each of these data points to return results to you that assess your current coverage and provide recommendations about how to improve your current coverage.
This is never required to visit the Site, but we do use this information to perform an analysis of your insurance needs.
Applying for Insurance
To get an insurance quote, in addition to the Checkup Information described above, you may need to supply your date of birth, gender, occupation, address, smoking status, height and weight, certain family history, certain health history, certain driving history, and your citizenship status (collectively, “ Quote Information ”). We use this information to calculate the price estimates for coverage you request.
To apply for an insurance policy, you will need to become a Member and also submit your social security number, phone number and address in addition to Quote Information (collectively, “ Application Information ”).
If and when you become a Member, you will create an account password. This is referred to in this Privacy Policy, together with your Application and/or Quote Information, as “Account Information.”
