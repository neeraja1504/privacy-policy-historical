What kind of information do we collect, for what purposes and with which legal basis?
1) Navigation data
Computer systems responsible for site operation acquire, during normal operation, some personal data that are implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.  This information is not collected to be associated with identified persons, but only for the legitimate interest of the site owner in the safe system operation and to ensure visitors the navigation on the site. By their very nature such data could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow users to be identified.  This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of computers used by users who connect to the site, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of the requested resources, the time of request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in reply, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the user's operating system and computer environment.   The data could be used by police forces and judicial authorities upon request for the performance of their duties.
The data will be used exclusively for the safe operation of the systems and to ensure the visitor the navigation on the site, thus constituting the contractual and pre-contractual implementation of this processing.
2) Data delivered voluntarily by visitors
These data are provided spontaneously by visitors to take advantage of the interactive activities offered by the Site.  In particular, Safilo may request personal information in some sections of the site, such as name, surname, address, date of birth, sex, email address, etc. This may happen, for example, if you purchase products, sign up for a contest, competition or promotion, send a message from the Contact Us section and in order to get services that require a registration or subscription.
Except where not otherwise indicated, the personal data supplied will be used exclusively to manage and respond to the requests of the user/visitor, thus constituting the contractual and pre-contractual implementation of this processing.
In each of the above-mentioned sections of the Site where personal data are collected for each different purposes, there are specific Privacy policies explaining the details of the processings, as well as any requests for consent to the processing of personal data for marketing and even profiled purposes (for more details click here), for which the specific consents are the legal basis of the processings.
The user/visitor is in any case asked to refrain from entering special categories of personal data, i.e. those that reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or union membership, as well as processing genetic data, biometric data intended to uniquely identify a natural person, data related to the health or sex life or sexual orientation of the person, since they cannot be treated further without consent and must be eliminated.
3) Cookies
We may also use cookies to collect information regarding the visits to our site and to improve the browsing experience.  More information on the use of cookies can be found in the Policy Cookie.
**Kind of the data provision and consequences of refusal  **
The provision of personal data above by users/visitors is automatic (therefore, mandatory) in the case of browsing the site for navigation data, optional for data provided voluntarily (see also the Cookie Policy for cookies). However, failure to give optional data will result in the impossibility of being able to enjoy certain functionalities of the Site and the requested activities. Instead, failure to give your consents to the use of your data by Safilo for the purposes of profiled and/or generalized direct marketing will not affect in any way the functionalities of the Site and the requested activities, but will not allow Safilo to transmit you the marketing communications referred to above.
Processing methods and subjects who may have access to data

Data will not be disclosed to third parties except for legal obligations or judicial authorities and will not be disseminated in any way.
