POLLCODE PRIVACY POLICY
This document describes Boardhost.com, Inc.'s Pollcode service's policies regarding privacy, and the privacy expectations that you may have when using this service, or when corresponding with us. Pollcode provides customizable polls, which are created and maintained by customers of our service.
Usage of our services is subject to our
Terms of Service
.
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS (I.E. THOSE WHO CREATE THEIR OWN POLL)
We do not collect more information than what we believe is necessary to provide our services. We never sell, trade or barter customer records. We only share customer information that is necessary in order for us to provide our services, including:
If you make a payment, we need to share your information with our billing providers to process the payment, prevent fraud, or resolve disputes regarding your payment.
We may disclose information in certain circumstances in response to a court order or in response to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative process, or may do so if we believe there has been a violation of law or an emergency necessitating such disclosure.
We do not utilize any sort of promotional mailing list. We will use your email address only to provide requested assistance or information, to remind you of an upcoming billing renewal, or to provide information that may be required by law or that may materially affect your usage of our services.
INTERNATIONAL USERS
We are based in the United States and our servers are hosted in the United States. You authorize us to store in the United States any information or content you may post, create, or otherwise make available to our service in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
UPDATING OR REMOVING YOUR INFORMATION
You may update any of the information you've previously provided us, or remove your account entirely by logging into your account and clicking "Update Account Info. Log in to the Account Administration Area from our main page at
https://pollcode.com/
If you do not use a poll, after 365 days of it not recording a vote, it will automatically be erased.
If your poll was creating using a Pollcode account, your poll can also be removed at any time by
logging in
.
Other updates and/or removals can be made by
contacting us
. We will respond within 30 days, and may request information sufficient for us to verify that you are inquiring about your own information.
Please note that most information requested and stored by us is the minimum necessary for us to provide services to you, therefore if you request that your information be removed, you may not be able to use our services.
CORRESPONDENCE WITH US
Correspondence received from customers of our service (who identify themselves as such) regarding their account will ordinarily not be revealed to third parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion, necessary for us to address any issues raised in or by such correspondence, or as required by law.
If you're contacting us about someone else's account, your correspondence may be revealed to that customer, or to other third-parties at our sole discretion (even if the third-party contacting us is also our customer). For instance, if we receive a complaint regarding a customer's account, we may reveal that complaint to the account holder, so that they may address the situation.
VOTING IN A POLL (INFORMATION LOGGED AND COOKIE USAGE)
Protecting a poll's results from manipulation requires that we are able to recognize whether a particular device has likely already placed a vote. To do so, when a person votes in a poll, we place a cookie that is used for the limited purpose of being checked for its existence on that device upon a repeat vote.
Additionally, a combination of the visitor's IP address and the particular poll's ID number are converted to an encrypted hash (which we cannot reverse), and then the hash itself is placed in a filter which is checked upon subsequent votes in a particular poll.
IP addresses of voters are not logged or otherwise associated with a particular vote.
POSTED CONTENT
Any information that is revealed in a poll or comment posted on a poll becomes public information; poll comments are not private.
Should you choose to include your email address or other contact information in a comment, you may be subject to unsolicted correspondence from other viewers of your post. Your comment could be indexed by search engines and found in their listings. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.
When you post a comment to a poll, your detected country and/or U.S. state may appear above your comment.
