The Website contains sexually-oriented adult material and they are not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. DVD Empire does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals under 18 years of age who visit the Website. If a person under 18 years of age has provided DVD Empire with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian immediately contact Customer Service for assistance.

We may periodically send you email messages describing new items, sales, specials and other offers that we think will be of interest to you. If you would like to opt-out of receiving these emails from dvdempire.com, please click on Your Account, log-in, go to “Account Section”, click on “Notification Options” and remove the check in the box next to the “Sales & Specials” notification option.

6. How we protect the security of your personal information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.
DVD Empire has also obtained a digital certificate from DigiCert®, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a DVD Empire Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password that you entered when you created an Empire Account (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to Your Account. Log in with your username and password, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.

By using or visiting the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
