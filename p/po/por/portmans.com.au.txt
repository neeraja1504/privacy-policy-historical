About this privacy policy
The purpose of this document is to set out our policies in relation to the collection, holding, use and disclosure of personal information relating to an individual. Personal information means information (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion. Sensitive information (for example your political opinions or health information) is a special subset of personal information which is subject to more strict legal requirements, however we do not collect sensitive information. This Privacy Policy also sets out how you can make a complaint if you believe your legal rights have been breached.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether at one of our stores, through our call centres, via our website or any the Just Group brands’ websites.
From time to time and in line with customer expectations and legislative changes, our Privacy Policies and procedures will be reviewed and, if appropriate, updated. This policy was last updated in March 2017.
We encourage you to check our website regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy. By continuing to use our website or our services you are indicating your agreement to our Privacy Policy.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, for example, you can choose to use our website without creating an account. However, this may restrict our ability to provide you with our services or access to certain features on our websites.
We also collect information from you automatically. Please see “Information collected automatically – Cookies etc.” below for more information about how we collect your information in this way.

Information collected automatically - Cookies etc.
Whenever you visit our website, our servers automatically record information about your usage of our website through ‘cookies’ and clickstream data.
Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device. Cookies and clickstream data are used to maintain session information between your browser and our website and identify things related to your use of the website such as the time, date and URL of the pages you visit, your IP address, your location and browser software. Some computers and mobile devices also permit your location to be shared with us (often referred to as geo-location data). Most browsers can notify you when a new cookie is received, or let you turn off cookies or geo-location services altogether. Turning off these services may mean some features on our website are not available to you.
We use information obtained this way in order to learn about your preferences so that we may improve our website and the service offered through it.
We use two different types of cookies – session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is stored temporarily; it only lasts until you close your browser. A persistent cookie is stored on your device and lasts until you or your browser deletes them. For example, we may use cookies to store your preferences or other settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit our website, web portal or apps. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your account (including personal information about your logged in status, your location, the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.
We use both first party and third party cookies. First party cookies are those which we use. Third party cookies originate from one of our partners or service providers.
We use cookies and equivalent technologies for lots of essential things – like helping you log in and tailoring your experience. Here’s a chart that explains how we use cookies.

When do we disclose your personal information to Third Parties
We will often need to pass your personal information to companies who perform part of our service delivery. The relevant organisations include those:
involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service such as third party suppliers, other Just Group organisations, loyalty and affinity program partners, printers, posting services and call centres;
which are Just Group brands or carefully selected third parties who wish to tell you about their products or services that might better serve your online and lifestyle needs, promotions or other opportunities, where you have opted to receive these;
involved in maintaining, reviewing and developing our business systems, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems;
involved in a transfer of all or part of the assets or business of a Just Group organisation;
involved in the payments system including financial institutions, merchants and payment organisations;

where you have given your consent.
Your personal information may be disclosed by us for a secondary purpose:
where you have consented to the use or disclosure; and
if you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for a secondary purpose which is directly related to the primary purpose of collection; or
if required or permitted by law or by a court/tribunal;
if we reasonably believe it is necessary for law enforcement related activities.
Because we operate throughout Australia and New Zealand (and, in the case of Smiggle, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Ireland and the United Kingdom), and as noted above because we use third parties to administer some of our service delivery, some of these uses and disclosures may occur outside of your country of residence. The countries where these service providers are located vary, but include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the USA. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient does not breach relevant privacy laws or principles.

If you do not have a registered account or are having trouble updating your personal information, let us know (see Contact Us). We will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to correct that information to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, the information is accurate, up to date , relevant and not misleading.
