Sexco knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so
carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Sexco, you are accepting the practices

What Personal Information About Customers Does Sexco Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Sexco.
Here are the types of information we gather:
•    Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other
way. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain
information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that
you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our
stores, and communicating with you.
•    Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For
example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
accesses Sexco. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of the information we receive. A number of
companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide
you with a personalized experience at Sexco if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools
exist.
•    E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation
when you open e-mail from Sexco if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to
lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do
not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Accounts Manager.
•    Information from Other Sources: For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example,
providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive
information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated
delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver
your next purchase or communication more easily.
What About Cookies?
•    Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart
between visits.
•    The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Sexco 's coolest features, and we recommend that you
leave them turned on.
Does Sexco Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We
share customer information only with the subsidiaries Sexco, controls and as described below:
•    Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling
orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists,
analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
•    Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Sexco customers on behalf of other
businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such
offers, please adjust your Accounts Manager.
•    Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such
transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that
Sexco, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred
assets.
•    Protection of Sexco and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is
appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property, or safety of Sexco, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
•    With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to
third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
•    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
•    We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the
entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
•    It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign
off when finished using a shared computer.
What Information Can I Access?
Sexco gives you access to the following information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases,
updating that information. This list will change as our Web site evolves.
•    Your Account Manager
What Choices Do I Have?
•    As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a
purchase or to take advantage of such Sexco features as Your Accounts Manager.
•    You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the "What Information Can I Access?"
section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
•    If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Account Manager. (If you do not want
to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still
govern your use of Sexco, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
•    The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
•    In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site,
Site Seeing on the Internet.
