In brief…  To deliver services you request; take payments; allow you to make use of interactive features (if any); manage and improve our services; communicate with you; marketing and associated profiling (only where you have agreed for email, sms, phone or social media direct messaging); administer, analyse use of and improve the Online Facilities; protect and enforce our legal rights or those of others.
We may profile your use of the Online Facilities and communications you agree to receive, and automated processes also assess your eligibility when you request a subscription to iFollow.
Several legal grounds apply to our use of your data, depending on which of the above purposes we use it for. These may include where: you consent; we need to perform any contract with you; we need to comply with legal requirements; or as necessary for our legitimate interests, but balanced against your rights.
We use information about you for the following purposes:
Services, Products & Opportunities- to allow you to register an account or otherwise receive products, services and other opportunities (such as an iFollow subscription or newsletter) and fulfil any of our obligations for delivery of those. Automated processes may assess your eligibility to receive services such as iFollow subscriptions, based on the information you provide - if you think that process has incorrectly refused you a subscription, let us know why and we will have a human review it.
Processing your data for this purpose will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for the relevant service where applicable (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) otherwise for our legitimate interests in complying with third party requirements which enable us to provide the service(s).
Payments and Finance - to collect payments from you for any paid for products or services, and/or administer any payments which may become due to you.  This will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for the paid for service or (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) for our legitimate interests in recovering debts due to us.
Participation and Interactive Features (if any) - to enable you to participate in chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups on or associated with the Online Facilities on which you can post information (if any)  and, where we deem necessary, to respond to any such posts you make. Information you post in these areas may become public information and must always comply with our Terms of Use (in relation to the official Club website) and  EULA  (in relation to the official Club app). The processing of your personal data here will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for the relevant service or (ii) for our legitimate interests in running and improving our services and managing our relationship with you as a customer.
Publications – to include you in relevant publications, such as where you win a promotion we or one of our commercial partners carry out. We will usually ask you for permission in these circumstances.
Manage and Improve - to manage and improve the Online Facilities, notify you of applicable changes where required and allow you to use the features offered by the Online Facilities. This will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you where relevant for applicable services (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) otherwise for our legitimate interests in managing our relationship with you as a customer, improving our service, and/or record keeping.
Communications - to communicate with you where necessary for purposes other than marketing. This will usually be necessary (i) to perform any contract with you for applicable services where relevant (ii) to comply with legal obligations where applicable or (iii) otherwise for our legitimate interests in managing our relationship with you as a customer, improving our service, and/or record keeping.
Administer and Protect - to administer and protect our businesses, the Online Facilities, and rights of ourselves or other associated third parties (including those of other users and partners). This may include routine tasks such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance and support as well as more formal matters such as bringing, defending or assisting in legal action where necessary.  This will usually be necessary (i) for our legitimate interests in running our business and systems in a secure manner, business restructuring, protecting our rights and property (including intellectual property) and preventing or tackling illegal activity or (b) to comply with a legal obligation where applicable.
Marketing & Associated Profiling- to alert you to information about events, surveys, competitions, offers, products, services and other exciting updates relating to us, and/or commercial partners.
We only do this through email, sms, automated phone calls or online direct messaging (such as using any private message facility on the Club website or as may be permitted on associated social media platforms) where you have agreed, so this is on the basis of your consent. However, if you are an existing customer we may contact you about our products or services similar to those you have previously received or enquired about (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications).
You can change your mind or adjust your preferences any time afterwards either in your personal profile page (also known as a ‘preference centre’) which is accessible from all of our emails, or emailing us at privacy@efl.com.We will also stop sending these in direct response to any other express communication from you asking to do so. We may measure the effectiveness of our communications, including Usage Data relating to newsletters and other marketing emails as set out in the “What information do we collect?” section above.
We also use tools to help us and our advertising network make relevant advertising available to you when you use the Online Facilities and our associated social media platforms (including facilities made available for this purpose by Facebook), and measure how effective that advertising is. To do this we rely on cookies, which may include codes associated with your device but do not themselves identify you by name. As mentioned earlier, full information on which cookies we use is available in our Cookies Policy, along with guidance about how you can set your browser to refuse all or some cookies. This type of bespoke advertising (and any postal marketing) is carried out on the basis it is necessary for the legitimate interests of us or applicable commercial partners in marketing relevant products, services and exciting offers.
Research, Analysis & Personalisation- to carry out market research so that we can improve the products and services we offer, and in some circumstances personalise content (including advertising as mentioned earlier) delivered to you. Your feedback is valued and helps to inform the commercial strategy, marketing activity and initiatives across the EFL Digital Group and Club. This will usually be necessary for our legitimate interests to study how customers use our products/services, to develop them, to grow our business and to inform our commercial and marketing strategy.
We may also process your personal data for other reasons, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. Where we reasonably consider that we need to process your personal data for another reason that is compatible with the original purpose set out in this Policy we will do so. If that is ever the case and you wish to get an explanation as to how processing for any new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.In some circumstances, this may require your consent.
How do we store your information and for how long?
In brief… usually in the European Economic Area (EEA) but always in a manner that ensures proper security.  We will only keep the minimum amount of information for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) set out in this Policy.
Location
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data, which we generally hold in secure data centres in the European Economic Area ( EEA ).
Some organisations to which we may disclose your personal information may be situated outside of the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is still properly protected. This may include safeguards such as checking the relevant countries have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission, or using contractual provisions to ensure your information is properly protected (certain contracts are approved by the European Commission).
In relation to personal data sent to the US, we usually check whether the ‘Privacy Shield’ applies – that ensures a similar level of protection to personal data shared within the EEA. See  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en, for further details.
Duration
We will keep the personal data you have provided only for as long as we reasonably require to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. This is in addition to any applicable legal requirements.Details of any specific retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available on request by contacting us at privacy@efl.com.

This right only applies to automated information which: you initially provided consent for us to use your data (see the “What do we use your information for?” section above); or your provided and we used the information to perform a contract with you (see the “What do we use your information for?” section above).
