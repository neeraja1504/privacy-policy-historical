In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including immediately following the registration process, when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by Pornupload, and when you report a problem with the service or with your account. If you contact Pornupload we will keep a record of that correspondence. In addition, Pornupload occasionally asks registered users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information or files if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Pornupload cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or while using the service, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
What does Pornupload do with contact information that I might provide when sharing files or folders?
When you use Pornupload to "Send a File" with someone, you normally enter that person's e-mail address into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share. Pornupload treats any contact information that you enter while using the service with the same respect and confidentiality as your own information. E-mail addresses that you enter when using Pornupload to share information are not sold or made available to any 3rd parties.
When you use Pornupload's "Send a File" feature, you can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file. If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by Pornupload are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient of the shared file.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
