COOKIES
To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. The majority of websites do this.
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
How do we use cookies?
The Website makes use of cookies to enable us to track certain information relating to your use of the Website. We may allow third party advertisers to advertise on the Website and such advertisers may also use cookies to record information about your use of the advertisement which you have seen and the types of things you appear interested in. A number of our pages use cookies to remember:
Your display preferences, such as contrast colour settings or font size
If you have already replied to a survey pop-up (so you won’t be asked again)
If you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this site
Also, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.
Cookies are also stored by Google Analytics, the Google service which measures the effectiveness and efficiency of the website.
Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do, some features of this site may not work as intended.
The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.
How to control cookies
You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time
SALE, MERGER OR BANKRUPTCY
If the Website is sold to or merges with, or if our business is sold to, merges with or enters a joint venture with another company, you should expect that some or all of the Personal Data collected from the Website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. In this incredibly unlikely event, we will either (a) obligate the other company to use any Personal Data transferred by the Website in a manner consistent with this statement, or (b) retain the data. In the event of bankruptcy, we will either (a) destroy the data, or (b) request permission that the data be passed to a third party.

This Privacy Statement is part of the Website Terms and Conditions (the “Conditions”) and all defined terms shall have the same meaning as those in the Conditions.
