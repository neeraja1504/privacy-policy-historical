Collection of information
PopKey requires that users create an account by providing us with an email address and password.

Why do I need to create an account?
By creating an account you will be able to personalize your keyboard, favorite GIFs and upload GIFs to your specific account.
If you change devices your account information will allow you to have your settings and information saved.
What Information do we track?
We cannot read any of your previous texts or see any past activity like purchases or sent emails, and we cannot track any of your conversations, keystrokes, credit card info etc.
We do not (and cannot) track what you do on your main keyboard or any other keyboard. PopKey can only track what GIFs are being used at an anonymous and aggregated level. This anonymous data helps us to improve the service, but that’s the extent of what we’re able to do.
