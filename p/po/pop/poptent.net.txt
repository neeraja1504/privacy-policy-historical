Please do not email us or use the contact forms if You are under the age of 13 unless Your parents have first fully completed and signed the Parental Notice and Consent Form.

Parental consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting Poptent as provided in Section 4, in which case such Personal Information shall be deleted. If Poptent has not received a signed Parental Notice and Contact Form within a reasonable time after You have registered with the Site, Poptent will delete Your Personal Information within Your user account.

Required Information
The Site is not designed to attract children under 18 years old, and members are required to be 18 years of age or older or, if not 18 years of age, obtain parental consent. Accordingly, Poptent will not knowingly collect or maintain information at the Site from children.
2. Accuracy of Personal Information

You may view Your Member Information by entering the restricted portions of the Site using Your Site Unique ID and Site Password and certain other codes as necessary.

3. Protection of Personal Information
Poptent endeavors to protect the security of Personal Information collected on the Site from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Site uses an encrypted connection when transferring Personal Information. Poptent also has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information Poptent collects online in accordance with industry standards. When Poptent contracts with third parties to perform any services supporting the Site, Poptent requires that the third parties protect the security of the Personal Information collected with comparable security standards.
Neither passwords nor security systems are foolproof or necessarily work as intended, including encryption, and people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Although Poptent takes what we believe are commercially reasonable security precautions, Poptent does not guaranty security. You agree to do what You reasonably can to help promote security (e.g., never reveal Your password or make it accessible to others).
If You or any other person believes they are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from Poptent, contact Poptent as set forth in Section 4 below and provide all required information. Poptent will supply, without charge, the information legally required to be disclosed that Poptent then has, subject to applicable law and reserving all of our rights and defenses.

Poptent may aggregate Your Personal Information by combining it with information about other users or may remove characteristics of Your Personal Information, both of which make the Information non-personally identifiable.
