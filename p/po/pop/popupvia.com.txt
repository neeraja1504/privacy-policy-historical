Tracking Technology Privacy Policy
Web Beacons
User : A person or persons using a web browser to view a website.
Merchants who establish a commercial relationship with AffiliateVIA may insert into their web pages an electronic file called a Web Beacon, which allows a web site to record Users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
AffiliateVIA uses cookies and Web Beacons to track referrals of Users on behalf of registered partners ("Affiliates") from their web sites to the web sites of AffiliateVIA's commercial partners ("Merchants") and also for auditing purposes. This information is used to remunerate the Affiliate for the referral, typically when a sale is made.
The tracking works by Affiliates passing Users to Merchants via a AffiliateVIA domain where a AffiliateVIA cookie is laid on the User's computer. The User is instantly forwarded to the destination URL specified by the Affiliate. Should a AffiliateVIA Web Beacon be present on a page the User visits, AffiliateVIA records information from the Web Beacon and accesses the cookie it laid previously to record the unique cookie ID.
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"):
AffiliateVIA does not record any PII either in the cookie or in databases about the User. The cookie stores only a unique cookie ID that links to data stored in AffiliateVIA databases. Data that is recorded in the databases includes non-PII information such as the page of referral, time of referral, Affiliate ID and destination URL. We will also record the User's IP address whenever the User's browser communicates with our server, for auditing purposes. Additional information may also be communicated for the purposes of remuneration and auditing: Sale value, sale time, sales quantity, order ID and item code(s).
Use of information :
Information recorded through AffiliateVIA Web Beacons is used to report non-PII about referrals to our partners. This includes page of referral, time of referral, sale time, sale value, sale quantity and item code(s). It will not be sold, licensed or in any way transferred to another party except for auditing purposes. We do not record any information about the User, beyond what has been described above, of their browsing activity, and we do not use that information to anticipate or plan for a User's future activity.
