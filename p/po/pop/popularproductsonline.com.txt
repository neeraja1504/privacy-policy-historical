We currently use cookies and beacons (also known as pixel tags and identifiers) as background technologies because they permit us to present a better Promotion, make navigation of the Promotional Path easier by the user and permit us to track completion of advertiser Offers on the Promotional path.

Use of Existing Technology. Cookies are tiny files containing small bits of information that a web browser stores on the hard drive of a personal computer at our request. Cookies enable us to remember users and user information from one session to another, thereby enabling us to provide better individualized service and pre-filled forms for your convenience.

Anonymized Data. We also collect anonymized data to calculate aggregate statistical information, to identify the number of users and participants in the Promotion, the number of users who clicked through specific advertising Offers on the Promotional Path, the numbers of users who completed such Offers, and to measure traffic patterns to our web site and through the Promotion path.
