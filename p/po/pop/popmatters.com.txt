Privacy Policy - PopMatters
PopMatters.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note this policy applies only to information collected by PopMatters.com online and does not impact information collected or used by PopMatters.com or its affiliates through other means.
How we gather information from users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters, news updates and other products, or when you make a purchase, such as a newspaper subscription. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, PopMatters.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences. What we do with the information we collect.
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. We offer you the opportunity to elect not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, as described below.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on PopMatters.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by PopMatters Media, Inc., and other PopMatters Media affiliates and partners; and other topics we think you might find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by PopMatters.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Your choice to opt out
From time to time our advertising and promotional partners may use Personally Identifiable Information to call to your attention products and offers they believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us with such information, you will not receive e-mail or other communications sent directly by our advertisers using information collected from our site, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.
