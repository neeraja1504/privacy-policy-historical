"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Site (e.g., by keeping you logged in).

Such information may include regular newsletters and marketing emails, including contest entries and surveys. You can opt out of receiving newsletters from the Site by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Site and Service related emails.
We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information (such as your name or email address) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use these records, and other Anonymous Information, to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Site or Services.
