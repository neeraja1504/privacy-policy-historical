THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
The Website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites.

It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

COOKIES
We may use data collection devices such as “cookies” (small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes) and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons to assist us in providing our services. These technologies make using the Website easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, helping identify you whenever you return to our Website, and reducing the number of times you are required to enter your password during a session. These technologies can also help us provide information that is targeted toward your interests and preferences. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser’s “Help” area for instructions). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. Please note, that if you set your browser to block acceptance of cookies, this may affect your ability to use the Service or certain portions of the Website.
Cookies will not be used by PONO to gather specific personal information about individual users. The usage patterns tracked by individual cookies will remain confidential, and PONO will not participate in any external site tracking programs, nor will we share any cookie-generated information about individual users or user patterns.
USER IP ADDRESSES
PONO tracks user IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, demographic profiling and traffic logging, but PONO will not use IP addresses to try to identify individual users of the Website.
SECURITY
Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not. A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is subsequently created. Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country, data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.
Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept, and expressly disclaim, any liability for direct or indirect losses arising out of any breaches of security in any way pertaining to your Personal Information or any other data during its transfer via the Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.
Personal data collected by PONO may be transferred across provincial, state and/or international borders and stored in jurisdictions outside of your home jurisdiction. These receiving jurisdictions may be subject to different standards of privacy protection than apply in your home jurisdiction.
PONO maintains record retention and destruction policies that govern how long information will be stored by PONO and when that information will be destroyed. Personal information will be destroyed by PONO when it is no longer required by law to retain the information, and when it is no longer required for any of the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. You may at any time have all personal information about you destroyed by emailing support@ponomusic.com.

CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURES
PONO does not track your use of the Website over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
PRIVACY RIGHTS
California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, or to inquire about PONO’s compliance with its privacy obligations and/or to obtain information regarding PONO’s privacy policies and practices please send e-mail to support@ponomusic.com or write us at:
