6. Third Party Web sites
We may link to third party web sites from our own web site. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party web sites or their use of your personal information. We recommend that you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their web site.

We may have APIs to allow you to interface with other services such as our job search tool. Please know that other web sites may have different privacy standards. We recommend that you acquaint yourself with their standards accordingly if you are concerned about API integration.
8. Third Party Access to Your Information
We may allow third parties to access, maintain, or otherwise use your information for purposes that we deem conducive to improving our Site and Service. For example, we use a third party hosting provider to host our Site’s data. We strive to always contract with reputable providers, but it is impossible to be one hundred percent sure of the reliability of a third party over whom we do not have complete control. As such, you hereby agree that we are not liable for any privacy breaches that may occur as a result of the actions of third parties.
9. Law Enforcement
We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.
10. Security of Your Information
At Pongo, we are diligent about keeping your personal information and credit card data secure. Take data encryption for example. We don't stop at using SSL Certificates. We are PCI Compliant and the data center where our servers are housed is SAS 70 Type I & II Compliant and meets or exceeds the criteria for Type I & Type II SAS Compliance. But, because nothing in life is ever foolproof, we recommend that you take every precaution necessary to enhance your own computer's privacy measures, including anti-virus software and firewalls.

13. COPPA
We do not allow people to use our Site, Service, or be a referral if they are under the age of contractual capacity, which is usually eighteen years old, and therefore the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act’s provisions, or its equivalent in your jurisdiction, is not relevant. If we discover that someone under the legal age is using our Site or Program then we may terminate their access, delete any information they have provided except we may store some information for a reasonable time in order to protect others or ourselves.
