If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (i.e., to contact you if you're a winner).
Interest-Based Advertising
Kimberly-Clark participates in interest-based (on-line behavior) advertising. This means that you may see advertising on our website tailored to how you browse or shop, or you may see advertising for Kimberly-Clark products on other websites based on your browsing behavior across websites.

As part of this self-regulation program, Kimberly-Clark supports deployment of the Advertising Option icon ("Ad Choices") in partnership with Evidon.
Privacy for Mobile Applications
You may choose to download mobile applications offered by Kimberly-Clark. If you use one or more of our mobile applications, the mobile application[s] collects certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID) and information about the way you use the applications. The mobile applications also collect certain information you voluntarily provide, such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information, such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer. Our mobile applications may collect precise information about the location of your device, such as when you search for a store. However, you must first provide permission through your device before the application obtains such location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity (or a combination of these technologies). Mobile service providers may collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Site or one of our mobile applications.
