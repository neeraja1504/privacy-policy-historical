Point2 is committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of personal information. We have accepted 10 Principles established by the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code. They are as follows:
Accountability:
Point2 employees are responsible for maintaining and protecting personal information under their control. Point2 has designated an individual to oversee the company's compliance with the 10 principles.
Identifying Purposes:
We identify the purposes for which personal information is collected.
Consent:
We only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your knowledge and consent, except where otherwise required or permitted by law.
Limiting Collection:
We limit collection of your personal information to only those details that are necessary for the purposes identified.
Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention:
Personal information is only used or disclosed for the purpose that it was collected, unless otherwise consented, or when required or permitted by law. We only retain your personal information for the period of time required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
Accuracy:
We keep personal information we collect as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
Safeguards:
We protect personal information we collect with security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
Openness:
Information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information is made readily available to you.
Access:
At your request, we inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information, and provide access to the information. You can challenge the accuracy and completeness of your information, and amend it as necessary.
Challenging Compliance:
You can contact us with any questions, complaints or suggestions with respect to the above principles.
What is Personal Information?
Personal information is broadly defined as information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. Data collected with personal identifiers removed, so that it is impossible to determine the identity of the person to whom the information relates, is not considered personal information.
Our Relationship With You:
We want to provide you with service on an ongoing basis and to establish a long-lasting relationship with you that will grow and change to meet your needs. With your permission, we collect personal information about you to:
Identify you
Establish and maintain a relationship with you, and to provide you with better service
Protect you, and us, against error and fraud
Comply with legal requirements
Your personal information may also be used to create statistics about Point2's business. We will not sell your personal information to any organization, for any purpose.
Consent:
The cornerstone to protecting your privacy is consent. We will only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law. We do not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service to you, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information beyond that information which is required to provide our services to you.
You may choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.
Types of Consent:
Consent can be express or it may be implied in appropriate circumstances.
Express Consent can be given in writing, in person, electronically, by telephone or by using a check-off box.
Implied Consent occurs when surrounding circumstances exist that lead a reasonable person to believe that this consent had been given, although no direct, express or explicit words of agreement are transmitted.
Withdrawing Consent:
We only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your knowledge and consent, except where otherwise required or permitted by law.
Limiting Collection:
You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you withdraw consent, we will inform you of the implications of such withdrawal. To withdraw consent, simply contact us and advise us of what personal information you no longer wish us to use.
What Safeguards Do We Have in Place?
Point2 has developed processes and procedures to keep your Personal information safe and secure. We have appropriate safeguards in place depending on the sensitivity of the information.
Disclosure of Personal Information:
We will only use and disclose your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. Any exception will be with prior consent, or as may be required by law. Also, we will keep information only for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
Customer Support:
Any attempts to undermine, slander, threaten, swear at or cause harm to a Point2 support staff is strictly prohibited and is grounds for immediate termination of account and membership in Point2.
You may access and verify your personal information and find out to whom we have disclosed it. At the time of your request, we will need specific information from you to verify your identity before we can provide you with the personal information we hold. If you identify any incorrect or outdated information requiring amendment, please contact us. We may ask you to put your request for a correction in writing.
We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of your personal information for as long as it is being used for the purposes we have identified. To help us keep your personal information up-to-date, we encourage you to notify us of inaccuracies or corrections as often as you wish. If you identify any incorrect or outdated information requiring amendment, please contact us. We may ask you to put your request for a correction in writing.

Yardi Systems, Inc. and its affiliated entities (“Yardi”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and maintaining the trust of our clients (“Yardi Clients” or “Clients”) and other users of and visitors to Yardi websites (collectively, “Visitors”). Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers data protection matters across the suite of products and services offered by Yardi (“Yardi Services” or “Services”), including data stored by Yardi on behalf of its Clients and their customers in connection with our Services (“Client Data”), as well as the personal data (including such data as defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation) provided by Clients and Visitors who visit www.Yardi.com, associated Yardi microsites and any other Yardi-controlled websites that link to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Yardi Sites”).
Web Sites Covered
This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit the Yardi Sites. When we collect personal data on the Yardi Sites, certain additional disclosures, that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. an event or seminar registration page), may be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.
IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA
Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (as defined in the agreements for those Services), are governed solely by the agreements under which the Services are provided to our Clients. The traditional licensees of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Statement, “Yardi Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are, of course, the residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at, the buildings Yardi Clients own and manage. Yardi Services (by means of example only, the Yardi Voyager web-based, fully integrated end-to-end platform product suite) help our Clients manage their real estate and other assets by, among other things, facilitating communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their tenants and service providers. Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by Yardi are done so pursuant to the subscription agreement in place between Yardi and the relevant Yardi Client, or Yardi’s applicable Terms of Service, which exclusively govern Yardi’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Yardi Services or Client Data. If you have any questions about the data practices of a Yardi Client, using Yardi Services to process your personal information, you need to contact the Yardi Client directly, and ask for their Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement. In other words, Yardi is a data processor and not a data controller with respect to Client Data. Yardi Clients make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was otherwise collected by a Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly. If an authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in question and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.
Web Sites Not Covered
Some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and applications that run natively on the Yardi platform. One such example are RENTCafé resident portals, which facilitate communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their potential or actual tenants. Such websites are controlled by Yardi Clients, and as described above, any information submitted to or collected by such websites is Client Data to which this Privacy Statement does not apply. The terms of service and privacy policy of the third party Yardi Client governs such websites.
Yardi is committed to promoting privacy principles and providing as much information to individuals as legally and contractually possible about the processing of their personal data. In that light, some Yardi Client-controlled websites that are created and maintained by Yardi Services may include privacy statements directly from Yardi to the users of such websites. Yardi is committed to adhering to such privacy statements. We provide these statements, or disclosures to identify Yardi as the data processor/technology platform, to disclose Yardi’s privacy practices with respect to such Client Data, and to inform the user to seek information about the privacy practices governing the website directly from the corresponding Yardi Client. To be clear, Yardi’s privacy statements on such Yardi Client controlled websites are applicable only to Yardi, and not the Yardi Client. In such privacy statements, Yardi discloses how Yardi uses and processes the information collected by and submitted to the website controlled by the Yardi Client. For the avoidance of any doubt, if you submitted personal data to a Yardi Client-controlled website created and maintained by Yardi Services (e.g. RENTCafé resident portals) and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.
Some Yardi Sites may be created and managed by Yardi Clients. Most of these websites are not accessible via the public internet. Regardless, please know that this Privacy Statement is not applicable to those websites, which are instead governed by the privacy statement of the Yardi Client that creates and manages the website. In addition, the Yardi Sites may contain links to other third-party websites. The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. Yardi encourages you to review the privacy statements of such other websites to understand their information practices.

However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.

To facilitate Yardi’s global operations, Yardi may store, transfer and access the information and personal data you submit on the Yardi Sites around the world, including the United States, Canada and other countries in which Yardi has operations.

By registering to attend an event, contacting us through our web form or providing information or personal data to us on any Yardi Sites in any other context, you consent to the transfer of your information and personal data among these facilities, including those located outside your home country.
