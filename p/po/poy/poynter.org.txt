The Poynter Institute Privacy Policy | Poynter
Privacy
Poynter limits the collection of personal information to what we need to identify and contact customers to recommend teaching or other Poynter resources. We collect personal information from anyone who signs up for a Poynter account, including name and email address. We ask for other optional information, including contact information, gender, date of birth, occupation and interests.
Poynter uses PayPal to process payments. We do not save this information. Alternatively, it is possible to make a payment by mail or by calling us with your credit card, mailing a payment to 801 Third Street South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701 Attn: Accounting or by calling 727-821-9400.
Poynter does not share information with third parties. We do use contact information from participants in our teaching and from those who register on our website to contact them about our work, including emails promoting upcoming teaching. Individuals may opt out of those communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email.
Comments or other information posted on forums, discussion threads or other areas of Poynter’s website or social media channels designed for public communications or communications among class members or forum members may be viewed and downloaded by others who visit the sites. For this reason, Poynter urges everyone to use discretion when deciding whether to post any information that can be used to identify them. Anything posted in discussion threads on Poynter websites should be considered public information for which there is no expectation of privacy.
Poynter encourages all participants in discussion threads, comments emails, chats, or social media posts to be respectful and constructive and avoid personal attacks. We will take appropriate measures should individuals repeatedly violate these terms.
Our goal is to provide visitors to our workshops, events and e-learning with the best possible educational experience. To that end, we strive to personalize the experience to the individual learner, to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our teaching.
A final note:
From time to time we review and may make changes to these guidelines. When changes are made, the new guidelines will be posted here. At that time, our Privacy Policy will be distributed to users and will be effective immediately. By accessing the site after any changes have been made, you signify your agreement.
If you have any privacy concerns or questions about this policy, please emailinfo@poynter.org.
