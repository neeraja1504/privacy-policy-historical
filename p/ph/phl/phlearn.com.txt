Information We Share with Third Parties
PHLEARN collects data that is critical to the function of our Services and delivering the best experience possible. As a general rule, we will not share or otherwise disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the following circumstances: 1) Under a confidentiality agreement, we may match user information with third-party data. 2) We may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, we have customers in 148 countries) in order to describe our Services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
Sharing by You
You will have the ability to share your User Content with another user(s). If you share your User Content with anyone, we shall have no liability to you (or anyone you share your User Content). We will not make any User Content that you keep private and do no share available to any third party except to a third party authorized by you to access such information or if the law requires.

You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information. You can contact us in order to update or correct your personally identifiable information. You may change your communications preferences as to what you receive from us. You may request the deletion of personally identifiable information about you on our systems, but only subject to the following condition: you must cancel your PHLEARN PRO Subscription (if applicable) and delete your entire account.

Please be aware that it is not possible to remove every record of the information you have provided to us from all of our systems.

After receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively own and control will be updated, corrected, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically possible.
Protecting Your Information
Your personal account information with PHLEARN is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information and the User Content therein. We recommend that you do not disclose your unique identifier or password to anyone. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished using our Services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information or User Content.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online Services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
