Additionally, we and our third party partners who administer our referral program may use cookies to identify you and your referred friends and to monitor the success of our referral program.

You may withdraw your consent to participate in our Research and still continue use of ph360 by contacting us at [email protected]  If you do not give your consent to participate in our Research, ph360 may still use your Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information for purposes such as quality control or other R&D activities. Phenotypical and Self-Reported Information used for such purposes may be included in Aggregated Phenotype and Self-Reported Information disclosed to third-party research partners who will not publish the information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific/medical research or conduct or support the development of programs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.
How We Use User Content and Web Behavior Information
ph360 uses User Content to provide our Services and improve the overall user experience. For example, posts made to the ph360 community forums are publicly displayed to other users. By submitting, posting, or displaying User Content, you give ph360 a non-exclusive license to use any User Content that you submit, post, or display on or through the Services, as further described in Section 13 of the Terms of Service. ph360 may make such User Content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals with whom ph360 has relationships, and to use such User Content in connection with the provision of those services. ph360, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users, may also (a) transmit or distribute your User Content over various public networks and in various media; and (b) make such changes to your content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services, or media.

If you choose to withdraw consent to participate in our Research, we may still use your Web Behavior Information for R&D purposes as described above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
Log Files. When users visit our website or use our mobile application, ph360 gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data (i.e. a list of pages or URLs visited). This information may be linked to a particular user’s profile ID or order number. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, identify and resolve issues, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
The ph360.me website also uses cookies. For information about cookies and how they are used on ph360’s website, please read our Cookie Policy.
Web Beacons. A web beacon is a clear graphic image that is loaded by your web browser when it accesses a website and that records a user’s visit to a particular web page. We, or third parties that work for us, may place cookies and web beacons on our website, in our emails, and in our advertisements that appear on other websites or in emails sent by others that mention our products and services with our permission. The purpose of our web beacons is to support operation of our website and to offer additional products and services through targeted advertisements. For example, we may use beacons to determine when someone views a web page, count how many individuals visit our website after clicking advertisements placed on other websites, or count how many people have purchased products from our website after viewing an advertisement we placed. Web beacons may also help us determine the effectiveness of an email campaign because the beacons can count the number of individuals who open an email or forward it to others. We use this Web Behavior Information to better tailor our marketing to you and may also use this information to customize content on our website, enable a shopping cart, or conduct research. Third parties only collect anonymous Web Behavior Information through the use of web beacons, allowing statistical analysis relating to the performance of our advertising. If you wish to disable web beacons, it is possible to prevent your browser from loading them, although there is not currently a standard method for doing so.
Information Sharing

In addition, you may be provided with the ability choose to disclose certain parts of your Personal Information to friends and/or family members, groups of individuals, third-party service providers, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals. We recommend that you make such choices carefully. Personal Information, once released or shared, can be difficult to contain. ph360 will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with a third party. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a ph360 customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of that person. It is incumbent upon customers to share Personal Information only with people they know and trust. Users with multi-profile accounts should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.
