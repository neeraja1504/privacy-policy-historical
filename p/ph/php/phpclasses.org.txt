Help FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions - PHP Classes
What is the "PHP Classes Repository"?
PHP Classes Repository is a service created in 1999 as a means of distributing freely available programming classes of objects written in the Web scripting language named PHP. The goal of this service is to build a base of programming components ready to be used in applications written in PHP.
Contents
What PHP classes are available?
Initially, only classes developed by the site creator, Manuel Lemos, were available. But some time after the creation of this repository, other developers started to contribute with their own classes. You may browse the available classes by entering the browse page.

How can I contribute with my own PHP classes?
Contents
How can I know when new classes are made available?
The site registered users may be notified by e-mail when a new class is added or updated.
Contents
Why do I need to register to download the class files?
This site does not impose a requirement to register in order to download any classes. However, authors have the option of setting whether or not users are required to register and login in order to download the files of their packages.
If users are not logged when they download a package, it is not possible for the site to keep track of the users that downloaded the package. Therefore, many authors prefer to keep the login requirement, so the downloads of their packages can be accounted for and the packages can feature in the top download charts.
Also, when a package is updated, the site can notify by e-mail users who were logged in when they downloaded that package. Users that are not interested in being notified by e-mail may set their personal options to not receive such notifications.
Many authors appreciate this automated notification service as it helps keep their package users up to date. Sending e-mail notifications when a package is updated also helps authors saving time providing support to users who might not have upgraded to newer versions with bug fixes and improved features.

Will I get spam messages if I register in this site?
No. As stated in the policy privacy, this site will not share your e-mail address with any entity unrelated with the site.
The registered users' e-mail address is required mainly to prevent users creating multiple accounts that could be used to distort the download accounting statistics or to commit fraud in the several types of voting systems on the site.
The site also uses the registered users' e-mail address to send messages of their interest through several types of site mailing lists, like for instance alert messages when new content is available or newsletters with important announcements related to site features.

How do I unsubscribe from the site mailing lists?
Users who do not wish to receive the site newsletters and alert messages, can unsubscribe from them by following the instructions at the bottom of such messages.
One way to unsubscribe from a mailing list is to send a blank message to an address mentioned at the bottom of the mailing list messages you receive. In response, the site will send you another message with the URL of a special page that you need to access to confirm the unsubscribe request.
When unsubscribing by e-mail, make sure you are sending a message from the same e-mail address used to subscribe. Otherwise, the site may not find your account and your unsubscription request is ignored.
Note that there are several types of mailing lists. Users can only send one unsubscribe request by e-mail at a time.
You should get a message with further instructions in response to your unsubscription request. If you do not get the message in 24 hours after you send your request, please contact the site administration for further assistance.
An alternative way to unsubscribe is to log in the user options page and uncheck the options respective to the mailing lists you are not interested. This way multiple list can be unsubscribed in one go.
Contents
Why do I still get messages after I have unsubscribed?
This may happen under several circumstances:
1. You have sent an unsubscribe request message by e-mail but you have not confirmed the request. When the site receives an unsubscribe request message, it sends a message to the user with an URL of a page that the user has to access to confirm the request and complete the unsubscribe process.
If you have not gone to the page mentioned in the confirmation request message, you need to go there or else you remain subscribed. If you did not receive that message yet, please wait at least 24 hours and try again.
2. You may have unsubscribed from a mailing list that has queued a message for you but it is not possible to cancel that delivery. If you have unsubscribed recently, please allow at least 24 hours to let the mailing list system finish current deliveries that may be in progress.
3. The site has several types of mailing lists. You may have unsubscribed only from one mailing list but you have not unsubscribed from others. In this case, follow the instructions to unsubscribe.
4. You may have another account under a different e-mail address. Take a look at the To: header of the messages that you receive to determine the e-mail address of that account. When you send the unsubscribe request message, make sure that the From: header of that message indicates that account e-mail address.

How can I delete my account?
This site does not support permanent removal of accounts. This is necessary to prevent the creation of multiple accounts with the same access name or e-mail address.
If the site permanently deleted existing accounts it would not have a way to prevent that new users create accounts with the same credentials of accounts that were deleted. The existance of multiple accounts of with the same credentials may allow badly intentioned users to commit fraud that must be avoided like in the top charts and contests organized by the site.
The fact that this site does not delete accounts is explained in the terms of use that all users must read and agree before they are allowed to register.
If you want to make sure that the site will never send you any more newsletters, alerts or e-mail messages of any other kind, please follow the instructions to unsubscribe.
If you are concerned with the privacy of your account information, rest assured that this site will never share any data of your account with anybody outside the site, as stated in the site privacy policy.
