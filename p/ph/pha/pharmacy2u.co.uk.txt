You can check the information that we hold about you by visiting your account or emailing us. If you find any inaccuracies, we will delete or correct them.

We have designed our site to protect the information we collect from unauthorised access. We protect your private information by following appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures.

Improving our service
We will never sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

However, we do not give advertisers information that identifies individual customers. We also do not use or share identifiable information given to us in any other way without giving our customers the choice to opt out.
