Your rights
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the following rights in respect of the personal information we hold about you. For more information about these rights or if you wish to exercise them please contact us.
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you. You will be asked to provide the following details:
the personal information you want to access;
the nature of your relationship with IOP, for example if you are an author, a subscriber etc; and
the date range of the information you wish to access.
We may also need you to provide information that will help us confirm your identity. If we hold personal information about you, we will give you a copy of the information in an understandable format together with an explanation of why we hold and use it.
Once we have all the information necessary to respond to your request we’ll provide your information to you within one month.  This timeframe may be extended by up to two months if your request is particularly complex.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, or your personal information changes (such as your email address), IOPP will correct, update or remove that your personal information as appropriate, where we are notified by you.  This can usually be done by you within any personalisation options of this website (where applicable), or by contacting us.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Please note that whilst we will honour your request wherever possible, we may need to retain some personal information about you for example, where we are required to retain records to comply with our legal obligations.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object to use of your personal information for marketing purposes, as described in the “Our use of your personal information for Marketing activities” section of this notice.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to another party. Whenever IOPP processes your personal information, by automated means based on your consent or based on an agreement, you have the right to get a copy of your data transferred to you or to another party.
