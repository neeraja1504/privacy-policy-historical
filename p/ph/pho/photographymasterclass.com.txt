The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted to PhotographyMasterclass.com, ClickBank, and/or PayPal. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
- Name
- Email address

The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Your e-mail address will be put on our e-mail list so we can send you information regarding the product (log-in information, product updates, etc.). E-mail broadcasts sent to this list are very rare (a few times a year, if even that).
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, all payments securely go through ClickBank.com and PayPal.com.
