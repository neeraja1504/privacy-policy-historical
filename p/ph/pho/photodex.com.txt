Finally, Photodex may use various tracking, data aggregation, and data analysis technologies, including, for example:
Cookies, which are small data files (such as, by way of example only, text files) stored on the computer or device you use to view a website, and which help store user preferences and activity. Cookies may record information you access on one page of a website to simplify subsequent interaction with that website, or to help streamline your transactions on related pages of that website. Most major web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you might be able to adjust your computer's, device's or web browser's preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the use of some or all cookies on your computer or other devices. Please be advised that if you choose to reject all cookies, then certain areas of the Site might not function properly.
Web beacons, which are pieces of code embedded in a website or e-mail to monitor your activity on the website or your opening of the e-mail, and which can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer or devise you use to view the website or open the e-mail, the URL page on which the web beacon is located, the type of web browser that was used to access the website, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons are sometimes used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Disabling your computer's, device's or web browser's cookies may prevent some web beacons from tracking or recording certain information about your activities. Please be advised that if you disable all such cookies, then certain areas of the Site might not function properly.
Scripts, which are pieces of code embedded in a website to define how the website behaves in response to certain key or click requests sent by the user. Scripts are sometimes used to collect information about the user's interactions with the website, such as the links the user clicks on. Scripts are often times temporarily downloaded to the user's computer or device from the website server, active only while the user is connected to the Site, and deactivated or deleted when the user disconnects from the website. Please be advised that if you disable any scripts through your web browser or other means, then certain areas of the Site might not function properly.
Google analytics, which is a digital analytics service offered by Google Inc. that tracks, measures and generates information about a website's traffic, sales, and similar information, and which is often used for statistical and marketing research.
By accessing or using the Site, you acknowledge and agree in each instance that you are giving Photodex permission to monitor or otherwise track your activities on the Site, and that Photodex may use the aforementioned tracking, data aggregation and data analysis technologies.

SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED.
Photodex will not share your personal information with, or disclose your personal information to, any third party, except:
when required by law, such as, for example, to comply with a subpoena or other legal process;

Photodex does not limit the ways in which it may use or share non-personal information because non-personal information does not identify you.

THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES, NETWORKS, AND PLATFORMS.
The Site and/or messages sent through or as a function or feature of the Site may contain links to the websites, networks and platforms of various third parties.

SECURITY.
When Photodex collects personal information directly from you, it implements security measures to help protect such information. For example, when you provide Photodex with your credit card information to purchase products or services through the Site, Photodex or a third party vendor encrypts the transmission of information over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.
HOWEVER, NO METHOD OF TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET, OR METHOD OF ELECTRONIC STORAGE, IS PERFECT OR 100% SECURE. "PERFECT" OR "100%" SECURITY DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE. THEREFORE, PHOTODEX CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION; AND YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE, AND YOUR OPENING OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS, LINKS, DOWNLOADS OR UPLOADS SENT THROUGH OR AS A FUNCTION OF THE SITE, ARE DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
To help maintain the security of your personal information, Photodex asks that you please notify it immediately of any unauthorized access or use of the Site, its features, or its content.
