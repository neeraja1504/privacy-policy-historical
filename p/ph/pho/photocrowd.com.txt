Use of cookies and other technologies
Cookies enable you to sign in to the Photocrowd.com site, and help us tailor your experience so that you can get the most of out of using it.
A cookie is a text-based file that is lodged automatically on your computer or equivalent device. Each cookie contains information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued it to you. The information that cookies collect includes your registration data, the date and time of your visit, and your navigational history.
There are lots of advantages to the use of cookies:
They help to safeguard your security by checking your login details, which may help prevent fraudulent use of your account.
They save you time by getting rid of the need to repeatedly enter the same information into boxes on sign-in pages, etc.
They enable us to offer you content that has been tailored to suit your particular profile as a user.
They enable us to identify registered users each time they come back to the site after initial registration.
They enable the site to remember your preferences each time you sign in, so that you don't need to keep answering prompts about how you want to do certain things.
Photocrowd.com wants to offer you an experience of the site that is as useful and relevant to you as possible. To this end we work with third-party partners, who use cookies on our site to:
record users’ behaviour – such as which email links they've clicked, which pages they've visited, which forms they've completed and which products they've used – to design tailored advertisements and communications.
measure and analyse information about the way people use the site. This information may include (but is not limited to the following): activity of the user's browser when they are using Photocrowd.com, the site path of users, general information regarding the user's service provider and host, and the time of day that users come to the site. This analysis then feeds into the work we do on improving our products and services.

identify which users have arrived on Photocrowd.com via an affiliate website or sponsored link.
This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Photocrowd.com only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
In addition to cookies, we may also use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs on our websites and in promotional email messages or newsletters. These electronic images help us work out how many users have visited certain pages on the site or opened messages or newsletters. We do not use these single-pixel gifs to collect personal information.
You do actually have control over whether or not cookies are allowed onto your computer or equivalent device. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline them. Please be aware, however, that declining cookies means that there will then be a less-than-optimal relationship between Photocrowd.com and your browser. You may not be able to sign in automatically, nor use other interactive features of our site and services that rely on the use of cookies. This may of course have a detrimental effect on your experience of using Photocrowd.com.
