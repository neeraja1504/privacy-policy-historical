Security Phonepages takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any firewalls or secure server software we may employ. Phonepages continues to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access. Phonepages has taken the following steps in this regard:
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Phonepages uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as registration information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time Phonepages asks you for a credit card number on Phonepages for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Phonepages, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.
Secure Storage Phonepages maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
Vendors and Partners Phonepages works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.
Employee and Contractor Access to Information Phonepages limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
Education and Training for Employees Phonepages has implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every Phonepages employee.
