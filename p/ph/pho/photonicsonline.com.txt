Photonics Online : Privacy Statement
VertMarkets holds its readers and customers privacy in the highest regard. It is a core principle of our company. Because of this principle, Vertmarkets believes that you should fully understand the type of information we collect, how it is used and how you can control what information we collect. Therefore this privacy policy discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
Information Collection and Use
VertMarkets collects information from our users at several different points on our web sites. Wherever we collect personal information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. When you  register  with one of our sites or sign up to receive one of our newsletters and promotional emails, VertMarkets may ask for your contact information (such as your email address) and your demographic information (such as your zip code, industry, and job function). We use demographic information to tailor your experience at our web site, showing you content and advertisements that we think might interest you. VertMarkets may also ask for such information at other times, such as when you request information from VertMarkets and/or our customers and suppliers. The information collected by VertMarkets may be used in a number of ways. For example, VertMarkets will share broad aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. An example would be where VertMarkets provides partners and advertisers with information about the percentage ’C-Level’ individuals who visit our sites, or about the types of industries that users come from. VertMarkets' goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about you, VertMarkets is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you.
With whom does VertMarkets share my information?
If you are requesting assistance, product information, white papers, case studies or brochures, your contact information may be shared with the developer of the relevant product, content, or software. Some materials that are available for download on VertMarkets' sites, like white papers, product demonstrations, case studies, and product literature, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. This information is shared with the partner company so that they may provide you with the material you requested. VertMarkets’ customer agreements with partner companies: (a) provide that the partner company may use this information in marketing related activities to contact you via common methods of communication; and (b) prohibit disclosure of the information to any third party other than agents of the Content Sponsor for the permitted marketing purposes set forth above; and (c) use of this contact information and adherence to the laws of any/all countries is the responsibility of the partner company.  You should contact the partner company directly if you have any questions about their use of this information.
In accordance with the GDPR no personally identifiable information from any EU member country individual will be shared unless affirmative and unambiguous consent to do so has been received. For more information on consent and the GDPR please visit our GDPR section in this privacy policy.
Promotional offers
Any individual who signs up to receive one of our newsletters will be giving VertMarkets permission to send promotional offers for select VertMarkets’ products. Vertmarkets endeavors to promote to you products and services that are relevant and that we feel you would have a legitimate interest in hearing about. These products or services may include content newsletters, research reports, events and training seminars. You can opt out from receiving these promotions at any time by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of the offer email.
In order to process these internal promotions VertMarkets may share your information, such as an email address with certain suppliers who are in contact with Vertmarkets. (i.e. an email service provider).

Vertmarkets and the GDPR
What is the GDPR?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a regulation intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU).  It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU.  It aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.  It impacts any organization that processes personal data in connection with goods/services offered to an EU resident.   When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).[2]    GDPR was adopted April 27, 2016 and becomes enforceable May 25, 2018.  To read more about the GDPR visit the official GDPR site.
VertMarkets’ Commitment to Data Protection and GDPR Compliance
As a 40+ year old Media Company, VertMarkets understands the importance of data security and the need to give our readers and our advertisers the ability to control and protect their personal data.
We have carefully examined the relevant provisions of the GDPR, spoken to professional experts and are closely tracking any new applicable GDPR guidance.  These steps are helping us to ensure we will be compliant with all relevant provisions in the regulation by the May 25th 2018 enactment date. Some of the key elements of the GDPR that impact VertMarkets and its readers are:

The right to be ‘Forgotten’/Erasure
The GDPR also provides our website registrants and/or newsletter subscribers with the ‘right to be forgotten’ or in other words have their information erased from our database.
