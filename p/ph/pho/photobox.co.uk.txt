We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner's Office (registration number Z4768023).
Photobox is committed to respecting the privacy rights of visitors to its Site and App. This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, store and use personal data about you when you visit the Site or App, buy Products from us or otherwise provide your personal data to us. It provides you with details about the types of personal data that we collect from you, how we use your personal data and the rights you have to control our use of your personal data. Words used in this Privacy Notice have the same meaning as is attributed to them in the Photobox Terms of Use.
What personal information do we collect about you?
When you access and move around Photobox, register an Account with Photobox or purchase a Product from Photobox, we may collect some or all of the following personal data about you:
a username and password;
name, date of birth, age and sex;
billing and delivery addresses, email address and phone number(s);
Payment Method (typically credit card or debit card) details;
your Images and other User Content;
correspondence with and from Photobox;
your preferences about receiving communications from Photobox;
information about your use of Photobox, and your browsing and online purchasing activities; and details we may ask you to submit to verify your identity.
We may also collect some of this personal data from third parties who have your consent to pass your details to us.
In order to take advantage of some of our Services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them a Product to them as a gift). We will not use this information for anything other than providing the Services for which the information was supplied.
We may disclose your first name and last name, to selected third parties, including but not limited to Pro-Gallery owners from whom you have purchased items. The purpose of this is so that a record may be kept by the third parties of who has purchased Products from them. It is a condition of your use of our Services that you agree to this disclosure of this data.
How do we use your personal information?
Your personal data will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies and other data processors acting under contract with us.
When you sign up to Photobox and agree to our terms and conditions, we need to process certain data that allows Photobox :
to provide the Photobox service to you in accordance with our agreement;
to create personalised Products selected by you;
to associate your Account, and your Product purchases, with you, and to verify your identity;
if you elect to store an encrypted Payment Method with us, to associate that Payment Method with you when you place an order;
to tailor aspects of Photobox (including its search function and offers) to you;
to process payments you make for Products;
to pass your Product order for delivery by third party deliverers engaged by us;
to provide customer support and improve your customer experience;
to contact you by email and mobile communication (such as text (SMS) and "push" notification) in relation to the products or services you have purchased.
If you’ve told us it’s OK (or unless you’ve asked us not to after a purchase), we would like to contact you to provide information about products or services we think might interest you. You may withdraw this consent at any time.
For legitimate business reasons we will also process your data for customer satisfaction and customer experience improvement purposes, such as by analysing data we hold about you, and combining it with data held by third parties, in order to discern your interests, demography and other factors, and in consequence to offer goods and services that are likely to have the greatest value to you. We would also use this data in connection with the prevention and detection of fraud and other crime.
If you elect to store a Payment Method with us, that Payment Method will not in fact be stored by Photobox itself, but instead it will be stored by a payment service provider under contract with us. The storing payment service provider will be required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Note that, when using a stored Payment Method to make payment for your Photobox order, certain techniques will be used to assist in maintaining the security of the details of your stored Payment Method. For example, not all of the payment card number will be visible to you (typically, all except the final four digits will be masked), and you will be required to provide certain information (such as, but not limited to, a CV2 card security number) in order to proceed with using that Payment Method. To remove or change a stored Payment Method, please follow the procedures specified on the Site or App, or contact our customer services team.
If you are asked to provide a phone number for a Product you are ordering, note that the phone number will be provided to the deliverer of your order – and (unless you specifically opt not to permit this) will appear on your order's packaging – to assist with the delivery process. If you do not wish your phone number to be used in this way, then please do not provide a phone number when placing your order.
We may use automatically collect anonymous information about your use of Photobox. For example, we may automatically log which parts of Photobox you access, which web browser you deploy and the website from which you linked to Photobox. You cannot be identified from any of this information. It enables us to compile statistics about the use of Photobox, and to help target aspects of Photobox and advertising to you more accurately.
