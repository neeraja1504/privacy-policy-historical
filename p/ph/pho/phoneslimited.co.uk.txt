If you are an existing customer Tech Enterprises will continue to keep you informed unless you tell us not to.
If you are a new customer Tech Enterprises will give you the choice (for example once you have registered your interest) whether or not you want us or other relevant and reputable companies to contact you about future offers, events and new products or related activities that you may find useful. Tech Enterprises will not bombard you with emails, but Tech Enterprises would like to keep you informed of the developments of Tech Enterprises.

Tech Enterprises will not send you any marketing emails or pass your information on to third parties unless you give us your consent, unless Tech Enterprises have it already. You will therefore be asked if you would like to receive information from Tech Enterprises and others in future.
