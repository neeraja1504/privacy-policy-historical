We collect your data for the sole purpose of being able to submit to you a user-friendly, efficient and secure Internet offer.
a) Use of the website
You may, as a matter of principle, visit our webpages without disclosing your personal data. All that is stored when you visit us is the URL of the webpage through which you gained access to our offer, the name of your Internet service provider and of your Internet browser, the websites you visited within our Internet offer, date and duration of your visit, the volume of data transmitted to you during your visit and your IP address. The storage of these particulars is not performed by us but rather by our service provider except for your IP address, which is stored by us. For this purpose, small data files (so-called cookies) are deposited in the main memory of your computer for the time of your visit. These are so-called temporary session cookies (for permanent cookies see para. 4) which are automatically erased as soon as you close your browser window.
The session cookies provide us for internal statistical purposes with so-called session IDs for storage in tracking log data files. The data thus obtained are completely anonymous. We reserve the right to have the logs analysed by external service providers. If we do so, we will take every precaution to ensure the security, inviolability and integrity of your data.
Our website may contain links to websites of other providers not associated with us. Once you have clicked such a link, we have no influence any more on the processing of such personal data as may as a result be transferred to third parties (such as the IP address or the URL on which the link is available). We have no influence on the conduct of third parties, so that we cannot assume any responsibility for the handling of personal data by them.
Nor can we be held responsible for data you leave behind in the context of our offer in forums and similar environments accessible to any user.

In particular, you may wish to designate your bank account for the remittance of the payments due to you for the download of your photographs on the basis of non-gratuitous download credits. Of course, you may just as well communicate your banking connection at a later date.

Data are passed on only if and to the extent that this is necessary for the performance of the contract of use, where we are obligated to do so by law or to the extent that this is required for the implementation of our general terms of use or the performance of other covenants made with you, or for the assertion of our rights and claims.

You can at any time request via email that we furnish information to you about your personal data being stored by us. Moreover, you may at any time have the data of your user account and, consequently, your personal data corrected, blocked or cancelled by us with the only exception of those data we need for the performance of the contract of use or the enforcement of our rights. However, if you wish to regain the full benefit of our offer after such blockage or cancellation, you will have to re-register.

However, we recommend to you to leave the cookies functions switched on as only if you do will you retain the full benefit of the high level of user comfort we keep striving for.

For our part we consistently make sure that only authorised persons will have access to your personal data and that such access is limited to what is required for the purposes referred to above. Our security precautions are continuously being improved as better technical solutions become available.
