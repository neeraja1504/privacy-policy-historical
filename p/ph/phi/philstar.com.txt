WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register to participate in our feedback section or to access our archive, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.
Personally Identifiable Information
Registration for our Web sites
Anyone can view our sites, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services offered across our different sites.
philstar.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (sex, age, household income (optional), job industry and job title, nationality, country of residence) to register. By using philstar.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our Member Agreement
Paid Products and Services
While the majority of our content is available for free, we do charge fees for print subscriptions to The Philippine Star newspaper and People Asia lifestyle magazine, among others. To enable the purchase of these and other products, we collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
On occasion, philstar.com collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than philstar.com, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
philstar.com may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Website or through the phone or email. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
Some of our readers are invited to be members of an optional survey. Panel members agree to participate in surveys about their readership of philstar.com, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Readers are contacted via e-mail, which link to online surveys. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only. Name, home address and telephone number are optional.
Mobile Messaging Service
philstar.com uses the information collected from your interaction with philstar.com by Text Messaging Service (SMS) ("SMS Service") solely for the purposes of our SMS News Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
philstar.com collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and philstar.com. When you send a text message to philstar.com or via philstar.com, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. philstar.com uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS News Service.
