Facebook permissions
For Phixr to provide all its Facebook-related services, it needs certain permissions to access your Facebook data. Here is which permissions are needed and what Phixr uses them for:
"Your basic info" : Phixr only uses your name for tagging yourself in a photo, and the list of your friends for tagging them and accessing their photos. No other information is accessed or used.
"Your Photos" and "Photos shared with you" : This is for allowing Phixr to download your photos from Facebook, including photo tags.
"Post on your behalf" : As dangerous as this might sound, in fact, this is only needed to upload photos to your albums. Phixr does not "post" anything to your wall. As of August 2013, this permission is not asked for upon entering Phixr, only later if you want to upload a photo.
No data obtained from Facebook is stored in Phixr longer than needed to provide named features. All such data is deleted within a maxium of 120 minutes after the last access.
You can revoke all permissions from within the "Privacy" page in your Facebook account settings. If you remove Phixr as a Facebook app, permissions are revoked and Facebook notifies Phixr; in that case Phixr will permanently delete all your Facebook related data.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
When you e-mail a photo, your Site user name that you are registered under is visible to the recipient(s) of the e-mail. So is the e-mail address you specified in your profile.
We do not rent or sell or share any personal information.
It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if the Site or our company is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We may share demographic information with business partners, such as "12% of users who regularly use the Site are from countries that start with 'A'" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission.
The Site displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. For further information, please see here
