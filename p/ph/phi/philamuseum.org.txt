The Museum uses technology known as "cookies" to track usage patterns, traffic trends and user behavior, as well as to record other information from the website.

Transactions
Purchasing Tickets/Web Ticketing
The Museum provides visitors with the opportunity to purchase tickets, programs, and membership online. When visitors to the Museum website choose to purchase tickets online, they are linked to a website powered by Accesso Passport, allowing us to efficiently automate the selling and allocating of tickets in real-time. Visitors to the Accesso Passport website are covered by the museum’s policy.
Museum Store and Online Membership
The Museum provides visitors with an opportunity to make online purchases from the Museum retail store as well as purchase a Museum membership. When visitors to the Museum website choose to make an online purchase or to become a member of the Museum, they are linked to a website powered by Mi9. You may browse the PMA's online shop without registering or submitting personally identifiable information.
When you order a product from the PMA Online Store, the PMA will collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information to process your order. This information is subject to the "Sending Us Personal Information" section above. The PMA will retain minimal personal identity information for our records, to facilitate better customer service, keep you up-to-date on your order status and to inform you of future products and promotions.
If you choose to register at our Online Store, the PMA will request the same personally identifiable information used to process an order (which includes your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address). This information is used to create a more personalized experience for you each time you visit. With registration, you will be able to keep items in a shopping cart for review or purchase at a later date, view a history of your past orders, and experience a faster checkout. If you need to change any of the information that you provided, you can safely update it any time you log in or it can be permanently removed if you contact us via the above email or postal mail address.
Your personal information may be stored by Mi9. More information on Mi9’s privacy policy can be viewed at http://mi9retail.com/privacy-policy/.
