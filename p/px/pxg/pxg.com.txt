Please read below and learn how we collect, use and share your information on this website and its web pages (collectively, the "Site"), and how we collect, use and share your information in the course of fitting you for PXG products and ultimately building and providing those products to you (the "Services").
1. The Information We Collect

For example, we partner with i-Parcel, a service provided by UPS. i-Parcel is the third-party service provider we use to deliver certain products to you, and as such we may collect information from them about your order so that we can ensure our products are delivered effectively, accurately and safely. UPS is a US headquartered company (please see section 7 of this notice, below, for more information on international transfers).

We may also share your data with anyone else, as long as we have consent to such an arrangement.
4. Our Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information (European Economic Area (“EEA”) Customers Only)
We will only ever use your Personal Information:
to perform a contract we have with you (for example, if you purchase goods from the Site, we will need to use your Personal Information to process your order and to enable delivery).
if it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for example, to let you know about certain products or services you may be interested in, to carry out market research, or to share your Personal Information with our third-party service providers to help us provide our services, sell our products and operate the Site), but where those interests do not override your rights.
if you have given us your consent (in which case we will tell you at the time how we intend to use your Personal Information). If you have given us your consent to use your Personal Information in a particular way, you may withdraw it any time by contacting us using the contact details below.
to comply with a legal obligation.
If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).
5. Third-Party Links
The Site may contain links to other sites that we are not responsible for such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. We do not control, recommend or endorse these other sites. These other sites may also collect Personal Information about you, and they may have their own privacy policies. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that you access through our Site.
6. Children
This Site is a general audience website and is not designed for or directed at children. As such, we do not knowingly process Personal Information about children under 13 years of age.
7. We may transfer your Personal Information to the United States
If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that we are a United States based company. Our Site servers are located in the United States and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners (such as UPS) operate around the world, so when we collect your Personal Information we may process it in any of the countries where our group companies and third parties are based.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These measures include transferring your personal data to third parties who are located in a country which the European Commission has determined has data protection laws that are at least as protective as those in Europe, and transferring your personal data to third parties who have entered into standard contractual clauses with us. For more information about these safeguards please contact us using the contact details provided below.
Your information will be protected under the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Information between our group companies, which require all of our group companies to protect Personal Information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.
8. How long do we keep your Personal Information?
Where we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. You can request deletion of your Personal Information at any time by contacting us using the contact details set out below.
9. How do we keep your Personal Information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information. Specific measures we use include encrypting your Personal Information in transit and at rest.
