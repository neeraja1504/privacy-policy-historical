Contacting Us
It is important that you fully understand what happens to the information we gather from you as a
publisher, advertiser or other user of Adperio’s website and services. Please read this Privacy Statement
carefully to understand how we will use and protect your personal information.
Collection of Your Personal Information
Upon registration we will ask a publisher to provide personal information such as name, email address,
physical mailing address, phone number, taxpayer ID number, or a faxed copy of a government-issued
ID. We may also collect non-personal information, such as your zip code, the amount you spend on
advertising, what type of Internet traffic you have (incentive versus non-incentive), or the source of your
Internet traffic (web versus email or search). We may use this non-personal data to improve the services
and advertising content we provide to you as well as tailor the services provided to you. We may also
share this non-personal information with others, such as interested advertisers, in aggregate,
anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personal information about
you or any other person.
When you receive email from Adperio, we may use Web beacons and customized links (or similar
technologies) to determine whether the email has been opened and whether you clicked on a link in the
email in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

Use of Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as clear gifs, single-pixel gifs, pixel tags, or action tags, are tiny electronic
images that we may use in our email communication to let us know if you have opened an email that we
sent you or clicked on a link within that email.

Sharing of Your Personal Information
Except as described in this statement or in any agreement that you enter with us, we will not disclose
your personal information without your consent. Adperio may disclose personal information if required
to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property
or personal safety of Adperio and our affiliates, both publishers and advertisers. Your personal
information and other data may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a
merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale.
In order to provide our products and services, we may hire other companies to provide limited services
on our behalf, such as to send email, to perform statistical analysis of our services, to provide affiliate
support, to carry out invoicing, or to make payments. These service providers will be permitted to obtain
only the personal information they need to perform their functions. They are required to maintain the
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
Our website contains links to the sites of third parties. When you visit these sites, please consult those
sites' individual privacy statements in order to determine how they treat user information. Adperio is
not responsible for the privacy statements or the content of such sites, and the privacy practices of
other Websites and companies are not covered by this statement. We request that users report any and
all concerns about our business partners' privacy practices directly to us as outlined in the Contacting Us
section below.

Security
Adperio is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of
security technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
use, or disclosure. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted
access to your personal information, such as our accounting department accessing your payment
information in order to send you your publisher commission payment. Our employees must use
password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter
their password to regain access.
A password is used to help protect your account and personal information. It is your responsibility to
keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a
computer with anyone you should always logout before leaving our Site or service to protect access to
your information from subsequent users. If you feel your password has been compromised, you should
change it immediately. After you have finished using our Site, you should logout of your Adperio account
and close your browser so that no unauthorized persons can use our Site under your name and account
information.
