Privacy Statement: PwC
Business contacts
Information collection​ ​
We collect and use business contact details for individuals associated with existing and potential PwC clients to manage and maintain our relationship with those individuals. Like most businesses, we use a customer relationship management system (the “PwC CRM”) to store personal information about our business contacts.
The collection of personal information about contacts and the addition of that personal information to the PwC CRM is initiated by PwC staff and may include name, employer name, title, phone, email and other business contact details. In addition, the PwC CRM may collect data from PwC email and calendar systems concerning interactions between PwC staff and business contacts.
When we send you emails, we may use technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and whether the links contained within the message have been clicked on. We may combine information collected through these means with other information we maintain about you to measure interest in our specific offerings and email campaigns, improve our offerings to specific target audiences, and tailor our interactions with you.
Information use
We use this information for the following business purposes:
Administering, managing and developing our business and services. We may process personal information to run our business, including:
managing our relationship with clients; ****
providing services and customer support to our clients;
developing our business and services, such as identifying client needs and improvements in service delivery and learning more about a client relationship opportunity we or other PwC member firms have an interest in; ****
analyzing and evaluating the strength of interactions between PwC and a contact  (e.g., the PwC CRM uses an algorithm to help with this analysis, and the ranking is primarily based on interaction frequency, duration, recency and response time); ****
performing analytics, including producing metrics for PwC leadership, such as on trends, relationship maps, sales intelligence, and progress against account business goals; ****
maintaining and using IT systems; ****
hosting or facilitating the hosting of events; and ****
administering and managing our website, systems, and applications.
Providing information about us and our range of services
Unless we are asked not to, we use client business contact details to provide information that we think will be of interest about PwC and our services. For example, we may send you industry updates and insights, information about other services that may be relevant to you, and invites to events.
Please review the Your choices ** _ _** section below for information about how you may unsubscribe from our mailing lists and exercise other rights.
Information retention
Personal information will be retained in the PwC CRM for as long as we have, or need to keep a record of, a relationship with a business contact. Personal information may be held for longer periods where extended retention periods are required by law, regulation, or professional standards and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
Information sharing
We may share personal information with third parties as described in the Information disclosure section below.
In addition, our business contacts are visible to and may be used by other PwC member firms to learn more about a contact, client or opportunity they have an interest in.

Corporate clients (and individuals associated with our corporate clients)

We may disclose video images to law enforcement bodies as requested and permitted by data protection law.
Visitor records
We require all visitors to first be screened through our video intercom at our reception floor before we provide access into our reception area. When at the reception desk, the visitor will record their visit and be greeted by their PwC contact person. The visitor log is maintained by the receptionist and is only used for investigative or emergency situations.
Guest WiFi
We monitor traffic on our guest WiFi networks using industry standard intrusion detection systems. This allows us to see limited information about a user’s network behaviors but will include being able to see at least the source and destination addresses the user is connecting from and to. We cannot inspect any encrypted traffic and therefore do not have access to any information (personal or otherwise) that the user might share via encrypted connections.
