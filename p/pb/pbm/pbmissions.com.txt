Privacy Policy
Thank you for shopping with us. We are fully committed to protecting your privacy. To enhance your shopping experience, we collect statistical information on the products and pages you view, and then we analyze that information in the aggregate. When you place an order, we necessarily collect basic information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. We use this information to confirm and ship your order, and to communicate with you concerning the status of your order and to answer any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (such as product manufacturers and suppliers, freight carriers, and/or shipping companies) for the sole purpose of processing and shipping your order.
After you place an order or register for our newsletter, we may contact you at a future date to keep you informed of sales, promotions, new product releases, etc. Any additional information you provide us will enable us to customize your experience at our site, showing you products and specials that may interest you.
We have put security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we collect. We utilize a firewall and use SSL encryption (secure certificate) to keep your information secure. We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify you and possibly to gather general demographic information.
