Pixel Tracking
In addition to using Cookies, our Website may employ “pixel tracking”, a common process which may be used in connection with our advertisements on other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code.

We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our services and other offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement we placed on another website, the pixel tag will let us know which website and advertisement led you to visit our Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
