Bluestreak : Privacy
Privacy
Bluestreak is committed to the principle that people using our technology and services, and the Internet in general, are entitled to their privacy. We only collect limited information to better serve our customers and users, while respecting the individual's right to privacy. We actively support and adhere to industry standards, and all applicable regulations and laws to ensure user privacy on the Internet.
Bluestreak's Web Site
Bluestreak gathers data from visitors to our web site who voluntarily submit contact information. This information will not be sold, traded or given to a third party except in the case of companies retained by Bluestreak to manage a contact list solely on Bluestreak's behalf for the purposes of traditional or digital marketing communications.
Ad Serving
Bluestreak does not use personally identifying cookies in the process of web-based ad serving and optimization. Cookies are only identified by a numeric code and are used for aggregate statistics gathering and group behavior tracking. Still, you may decline the use of Bluestreak tracking cookies, by opting out. This will place a permanent cookie on your hard drive that tells the Bluestreak servers that you are not to be tracked.
Opt out of web cookies
