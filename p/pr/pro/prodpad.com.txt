Privacy Policy -
We provide a service that allows you and your team to be more productive in your product management processes.
Our privacy policy is reviewed at regular intervals to ensure it meets the current statutory requirements.
This policy covers ProdPad and CreateShift websites (including www.prodpad.com, www.createshift.com) as well as the software and services made available through the ProdPad APIs. By using CreateShift services you are agreeing to this privacy policy.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy CreateShift Ltd (a UK registered company with the registered office Kemp House, 152 City Road, London EC1V 2NX) is the data controller “CreateShift”.
Our cookie policy is detailed here.
Data Type | Processing Location | Processor | GDPR Legal Basis | Retention Period
---|---|---|---|---
Customer Data | EU | CreateShift Ltd, AWS Inc | N/A | Until Hard Delete is requested
Personal Information | EU, US | CreateShift Ltd, AWS Inc, Zendesk Inc, Mailchimp Inc, Intercom Inc | Legitimate Interest, Contractual | Varies (see Appendix A)
Billing Information | EU, US | Recurly Inc, Stripe Inc | Contractual | 6 years as required by UK statutory obligations
Customer Data
Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as “Customer Data”. As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that created the account (the “Customer”). Where ProdPad collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer.
If you join an account and create a user profile, you are a “user,” as further described in the Terms of Service. If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.
CreateShift employees or contractors only access Customer Data at the request of Customer in order to provide support.
Customer Data is retained until a Hard Delete is requested by the Customer.
Customer Feedback
As part of providing Services to the Customer, CreateShift collects customer feedback and customer details (name, email, social media, telephone and avatar images) on behalf of the Customer and serves as a processor of that data for the Customer.
For the purposes of GDPR, we are a data processor of customer feedback on behalf of our clients. If you wish to exercise your data subject rights, you’ll need to contact the client who is the data controller. If you make a request of us in relation to this, we will redirect your request to the client and let you know we have done so.
Billing Information
Billing information is collected in order to fulfill the contract of providing Services to the Customer. The collected billing information includes credit card details, billing address and billing contact. According to UK law, we are obliged to retain these details for a period of 6 years.
The billing information is processed by Recurly Inc. and Stripe Inc. both of which process the data in the US. The data is transferred to the US under the US-EU Privacy Shield and US-Swiss Privacy Shield.
Personal Information

You can optional add an avatar image if you choose. During registration we check Gravatar to see if you have made an avatar available and if so, use that. At any time you can delete your avatar image from your profile.
