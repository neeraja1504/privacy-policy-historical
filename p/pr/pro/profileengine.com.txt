Any parts of your profile on another social network which that social network has allowed our search engine to download and store at a time when your privacy settings permitted search engines to index those parts of your profile.

Information collected in this way is treated by us as "Public information". Note: We are not notified if you revoke the permission for search engines to index your profile and doing so will not remove your profile from our database. Revoking that permission only prevents search engines from accessing changes make to your profile after you revoked the permission.

Where it is necessary to restore data or build a new database from a backup copy, recent changes may be lost and old or deleted content may reappear on the system. We may attempt to alert you to this fact where it is deemed necessary and you have provided contact information but we are under no obligation to do so.
