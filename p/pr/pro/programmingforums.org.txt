DaniWeb IT Discussion Community - FAQ: Privacy Statement
Registration requires a unique username, a password, and a valid email address. Additionally, we request a new member's full name, company, primary role and company size during the registration process, but providing this information is entirely optional. DaniWeb requires double opt-in registration, and in order to enjoy member privileges, email confirmation is required. To comply with federal anti-spam guidelines, DaniWeb stores the registration email address, current email address, all IP addresses used to register with and post, activation ID number, date of registration, date of activation, and date last visited of all members as confirmation and proof of double opt-in status. Because passwords are one-way encrypted in the database, it is impossible for them to be decoded by any staff member, even with direct access to the database.
Monthly community-oriented digests are emailed to all members, by default, on the first Tuesday of each month. Members have the option to disable these at any time via the User Control Panel. Additionally, they can be instantly disabled without the need to log in by clicking on a custom-generated link located near the bottom of each newsletter issue.
Registered members have the option of filling out a user profile which includes personal information such as their full name, contact information and employment status. All such information is optional. While some of it is used by DaniWeb as part of market research studies, some information, such as a member's full name, may be displayed publically within member profiles.
At times, DaniWeb may share information contained within member profiles with our partners. In each case, there is a clear notice that taking a certain action will grant DaniWeb permission to share limited profile information with a specific company, and the company is mentioned by name. Currently, the only time DaniWeb shares information is when downloading a company-sponsored white paper, in which case we may share information with the company regarding who downloaded their white paper as part of lead generation opportunities.
