Advertising Policy, Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
Project Swole allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Project Swole website.

It is important to note that they have no influence over the content of Project Swole and that we have placed descriptive text near all advertisements, clearly labeled with the words “Advertisement” or “Ads By.”
These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Project Swole website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies or other tracking technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
Project Swole does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if you respond to any advertisements, the advertiser or ad-server may collect certain information about you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Project Swole’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.
Data Security Project Swole uses commercially reasonable safeguards (physical, managerial, and technical) to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Project Swole and you transmit any such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Project Swole makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Project Swole learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
