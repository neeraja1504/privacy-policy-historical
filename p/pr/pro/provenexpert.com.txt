Part 1 - Introduction
Personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers are always processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as with the country-specific data protection regulations relevant to us. This Privacy Policy contains information about the type of data that we collect, the extent to which we collect data and its purpose, and also about the rights that you have, provided that personal data has been collected or processed.

As the persons responsible for data processing, we have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data processed by us is protected as completely as possible.

This data protection declaration applies to the personal data of our customers and suppliers as well as visitors to our websites.

Even if we already hold your personal data, you are entitled to various rights with regard to this information. If you would like to talk to us regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will make every effort to take care of your query as soon as possible and every case will be treated in accordance with applicable legal regulations. Please note that we may record our communication in order to better solve the issues raised by you.
Insofar as we save your personal data, certain legal rights apply (the "rights of the person affected"), which we will outline here. More information about individual rights can be found here.
Right to access information
At any time, you have the right to request us to confirm which information we have saved about you, and to request that this information be changed, updated, or deleted. We can then comply with your request. We also have the following options:
We may ask you to confirm your identity, or request further information, and
provided that this is permitted by law, we can decline your request. In this case, we will explain the reasons for doing so.
Right to objection:
If we use your data because we believe this is in our legitimate interests and you do not agree, you have the right to object. We will respond to your request within 30 days. In certain cases, we are entitled to extend this period. We will usually only disagree in very narrowly defined circumstances.

Right to correction
You have the right to request that the personal data concerning you be immediately corrected or amended.

Right of appeal to a regulatory body
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a local regulatory body. Details on this topic can be found here.
7. Use of cookies
Our websites/web services use "cookies". Cookies are small text files that are saved on the hard drive of your PC (client) for a defined period.
Most cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browsing session (known as session cookies).
Other cookies stay on your computer and allow us to recognize your computer on your next visit ( (permanent or persistent cookies).
Cookies usually contain a "cookie ID". This is a pseudonymized date in the form of a unique cookie identification.
It consists of a series of characters that can be used to associate websites and the servers with a specific Internet browser (client) in which the cookie is saved.
Cookies are generally distinguished into first and third party cookies.
First party cookies will only be assigned by the website that you are currently on (for example, the website under the domain provenexpert.com).
Expert Systems AG uses first party cookies for essential website functions, like for storing website settings, restoring sessions and for securing your session data.
Within this process, access only occurs in impersonalized form and exclusively when you visit our website. Other websites cannot access this information.
To ensure the data security of our visitors, it is necessary to allow first party cookies in order to use provenexpert.com .
Third party cookies are set by a third party provider that has been authorized by Expert Systems AG, i.e. not by the actual website that you are currently viewing.
By using these cookies, we can adjust our offers to best meet customer preferences and can make browsing our site as convenient as possible for you (advertising, conversion tracking and personalization).
In addition, we use third party providers in order to collect online statistics (analytics) as a basis for measuring the success of our advertising offers and subsequently improving them.
Even when cookies from third party providers are used, data is only accessed in an anonymized form.
An overview of third parties on our websites can be found here in the section entitled "Use and application of third party tools and services on our websites".
All essential services from our website/web services essentially work without the use of third party cookies.
You may prevent the installation of cookies anytime by selecting the option "Do not accept cookies" in your browser. In addition, you can at any time delete cookies via your Internet browser or another software program. This can be done with any standard Internet browser.
Part 3: Our Privacy Policy in detail
A. Detailed information about the processing of user and customer data
1. What personal data do we collect?
General personal data of our users & Customer data:
We collect some data about our customers and users that we require to deliver our products and implement contracts and for license management. We therefore require your name, your email address and country of residence in order to create a user account, which is then used to order service packages. The same information is collected when you register for our newsletter. We may also require further information from you (e.g. address, telephone number or date of birth) to order of services. You may also provide us with further data - this is optional. The specific data collected depends on the form or input mask used, or as requested by our support staff over the phone.
If for any reason we require additional personal data from you, we will let you know.
We analyze the use of our products with Google Analytics. Here, specific computer data (including your computer's hardware key, processor name etc.) is used to create a pseudonymized profile, which collects usage data in order to improve our products. For more information on this topic can be found here.
General personal data of evaluators of our users and customers:
When you create reviews, we generally store only your email address and the associated log file as inventory data.
You also have the option to enter your first and last name, which we will also save.
Visitors to our websites:
When normal Internet users visit our website, we save data to what are known as log files. Log files consist of the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider to the computer making the request for that session, as well as the name and version of the Internet browser being used to visit the website.
We also use our own session cookies when you visit our website. The information we obtain from these include the type and version of your Internet browser, the website from which you came to our website, which pages you visited on our website, as well as the date and duration of your visit.
2. From whom is personal data collected?
We generally only collect your personal data directly from you.

3. Why we collect personal data and what we use it for
User data:
In general, we use information about our users or customers in the following ways:
a) Advertising measures
We may send you information at regular intervals that we believe to be of interest to you, and also inform you of certain discounts and special offers to which you are entitled as a result of your business relationship with us.
We require your consent for some aspects of these activities that are not covered by our legitimate interests (in particular for data collection using cookies and direct marketing to you through our digital channels). According to the circumstance, we will ask for your explicit consent via "opt-in" or silent consent via "soft opt-in" (see below).
Consent via "Soft opt-in" is a specific form of consent that applies if you have had business dealings with us before (e.g. you have ordered a product from us or registered a domain with us) and we may advertise other products or services within this context. For consent via "soft opt-in", we will consider your consent as provided, as long as you do not withdraw it.
You can revoke your consent at any time. For more information on this topic can be found here.
Our advertising as a whole is based on entities that we consider to be especially helpful to our customers and users. However, we are aware that we do not always do things the right way for everybody. We may use your data to display you advertisements and other Expert Systems AG content on other websites, e.g. Facebook. If you do not wish your data to be used in this way, please change the cookie settings in your browser, as described above. Even if you deactivate advertisement cookies, it's possible that you may continue to receive Expert Systems AG advertisements. If this happens, it is because the advertisement is targeted towards an anonymous target group and not towards you specifically.
b) Functionality of our products and protection of our intellectual property rights
We are dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights, not least for the purposes of being able to offer you our products and services at their usual standard of quality and at attractive prices.
In order to enable you to use our products, a user account is necessary, where certain data must be obligatorily saved (name, email address and country).
c) Assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims
In unusual cases, we may also use your personal data in order to assert, exercise or defend legal rights.
We may use your personal data for these purposes if it corresponds with our legitimate interests. For more information on this topic and what that means can be found here.

External service providers that provide services in our name (including external email providers, auditors and accountants, technical support)
Providers of external IT services and storage providers, if a corresponding arrangement (or similar assurance) exists
Marketing technology platforms and suppliers
If in future we merge with or are acquired by another company (or should meaningful discussion about such a possibility take place), we may disclose your personal data to the (future) new company owners.
In general, we reserve the right to also transmit your data to other countries outside of the EU or EEA. In this case, we will however ensure a minimum level of data protection corresponding to the GDPR level of protection, through the appropriate arrangements.

6. How we protect your personal data
We will adopt all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the personal information we have stored from misuse, loss or unauthorized access. To this end, we have taken a range of technical and organizational measures. This includes measures to deal with any suspected breaches of data.

B. Detailed information about the use of our website
As mentioned above, we collect a limited amount of data from visitors to our websites in order to facilitate navigation of our websites and to better manage the services that we offer to you. You can use our websites without having to provide any personal data. In certain cases (e.g. Store orders, product activation etc.), processing of personal data may be required.
1. General data and information collection
Our websites collect a variety of general data and information each time one of their pages is loaded. This general data and information is saved to our server log files. Data that may be collected includes (1) browser types used and their versions, (2) operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our websites (what is known as a "referrer"), (4) subpages on our websites that are accessed by an accessing system, (5) date and time of visit to websites, (6) an Internet Protocol Address (IP address) and (7) any other similar data and information, that could serve as hazard prevention in the event of an attack on our information technological systems.
No conclusions are drawn about the person concerned during the use of this general data and information. This information is required in order to (1) correctly transmit the content of our website, (2) optimize content of and advertising for our website, (3) guarantee the permanent functional operability of our information technology systems and technology for our website, and (4) in the event of a cyber attack, provide law enforcers with necessary information for prosecution. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore evaluated by Expert Systems AG statistically and also with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our company ultimately to ensure an optimum level of protection for the personal data processed by us. Anonymous server log file data are stored separately from all personal data provided by a person concerned.
2. Registration on our website
You can register your personal data on several of our websites, for instance by signing up to our newsletter or setting up a user account (e.g. by activating an Expert Systems AG product).

The personal data submitted by the person concerned will be collected and stored for the sole purpose of internal use and purposes by Expert Systems AG. We may arrange for disclosure to one or more contract processors, for example a telecommunications provider, who also uses the personal data exclusively for an internal use that is attributable to us.

This data is stored against the background that the misuse of our services can only be prevented in this manner and that this data may enable committed criminal offences to be investigated. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary for Expert Systems AG security reasons. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless required to do so by law or for the purpose of criminal prosecution.
Registration by voluntarily submitting data also enables us to offer you content or services that may only be offered to registered users due to to the nature of the offer. Registered users are free to modify personal data submitted during registration or have them deleted in entirety from our database at any time, provided that it is no longer needed to fulfil the contract (e.g. if the contract term has not yet expired) or is subject to legal retention periods.
Upon request, we will provide you at any time with information about which personal data we have stored about you.
Our data protection officer is available as a contact person in this regard.
3. Subscription to our newsletter

You can only receive our newsletter if you (1) have a valid email address and (2) have registered for newsletter distribution.
When registering for the newsletter, the IP address provided by your Internet service provider (ISP), date and time of registration will also be stored.

A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in emails in HTML format for the purposes of recording and analyzing log files. This enables us to conduct a statistic evaluation of the success or failure of our online marketing campaigns. On the basis of the technology used, we can recognize whether and when an email was opened by you and whether you clicked on the links within the email.
Data collected in this manner is stored and evaluated on our account by CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, MÃ¼hlenstraÃŸe 43, 26180 Rastede, in order to optimize newsletter distribution and modify the content of future newsletters further so that they match the interests of the person receiving the newsletter. Your data will not be disclosed to any third parties. You can revoke your declaration of consent for this, which you have granted separately, in this regard at any time. To do so, please contact our data protection officer.
5. Blog comment feature

All personal and non-personal data generated (comments, links, usernames, passwords) and submitted (email addresses, third-party login credentials) via the Disqus comment system are sent to the Disqus server, where they are processed and stored. The Terms of Use and policies of Disqus apply with regard to this process and can be found here.
6. Contact options via the websites

7. Use and application of third party tools and services on our websites
We have integrated various third-party components on our websites. primarily for the purpose of optimizing your surfing experience and analyze user behavior on our websites. The following provides you with more information about this:
a) Google
We use various services provided by Google, Inc. on our websites. The operator for the services of Google Remarketing is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The following services are integrated into our websites:
Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
The Expert Systems AG has integrated Google Analytics components into its websites.
The operator for Google Analytics components is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
Google complies with the data protection provisions of the Privacy Shield agreement and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Privacy Shield" program.
https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI
Expert Systems uses an anonymization function for web analysis via Google Analytics, which Google uses to shorten and anonymize the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned.
Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, organization and analysis of data on the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analytics service collects, among other things, data on which websites a person concerned came to a website from ("referrer" URLs), which subpages of the websites were accessed or how often and for how long a website was viewed. These web analysis metrics are mainly used as a data basis for optimizing the functions and contents of a website.
Google Analytics sets a cookie on the computer of the person concerned. The definition of cookies has been provided above. Using cookies enables Google to analyze the use of our websites. Each time a user visits one of the pages of the websites that are operated by Expert Systems AG and upon which Google Analytics components are embedded, the Internet browser on the computer of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the Google Analytics components to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical procedure, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which enables Google to trace the origin of the visitors and their behavior on the site, among other things.
Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access came and the frequency of visits to our websites by the person concerned. For every visit to our websites, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, will be transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal data will be stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose the personal data collected through this technical process to third parties.
You can prevent the setting of cookies by our websites, as described above, at any time via the settings for your Internet browser and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. This Internet browser setting will also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the computer of the person concerned. In addition, cookies that have already been set by Google Analytics can be deleted via your Internet browser or another software program.
Furthermore, the person concerned has the option to object to and prevent the recording of data on the use of these websites by Google Analytics and the processing of this data by Google. To do so, the person concerned must download and install a browser add-on under the linkhttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on communicates to Google Analytics via JavaScript that data and information regarding visitors to websites may not be transferred to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on will be considered as an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the person concerned is at a later point in time deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the person concerned must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person under their authority, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.
Further information and the Google Analytics Privacy Policy can be viewed at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and at http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
Google AdWords
Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that permits advertisers to place ads in Google search engine results and in the Google advertising network. Google AdWords enables advertisers to set predefined keywords: an advertisement will be displayed in Google search results only if the user's search engine results are relevant to the keywords. Within the Google advertising network, advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites by means of an automatic algorithm and predefined keywords.
Google AdWords are used for the advertisement of our websites through the placement of interest-based advertisements on websites of other companies and in the search engines results for search engine Google, as well as the placement of third party advertisements on our website.
Should a person arrive at our website via a Google advertisement, a "conversion cookie" will be placed on the computer of that user by Google. The definition of cookies has been provided above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after a limited period of time and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain subpages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been accessed on our website. The conversion cookie enables both us and Google to track whether a person who has placed an ad on our website has generated revenue, that is, whether they have completed or canceled a purchase of goods.
The data and information obtained through the use of conversion cookies are used by Google to create statistics about visits to our website. These visitor statistics are in turn used by us to determine the total number of users who arrived at our website via AdWords advertisements, as well as the success rate of the corresponding AdWord advertisement, and to optimize our AdWords advertisements in the future. Neither our company nor the other clients of Google AdWords receive information from Google which could identify the person concerned.
By means of conversion cookies, personal data is saved, for example the websites that have been visited by the person concerned.

b) Microsoft Ads
The Expert Systems AG has integrated Microsoft Ads into this website. Microsoft Ads is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads both in Microsoft's search engine results and in the Microsoft advertising network. Microsoft Ads allows an advertiser to specify certain keywords in advance, which are used to display an ad in Microsoft's search engine results only when the user uses the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. Within the Microsoft advertising network, advertisements are distributed to thematically relevant websites by means of an automatic algorithm and predefined keywords.
The operating company for Microsoft Ads' services is Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.
The purpose of Microsoft Ads is to promote our website by displaying interest-relative advertising on Microsoft.com (and websites operated by Microsoft such as MSN.com, Bing.de and Bing.co.uk), AOL and Yahoo.com (including websites operated by Yahoo). The search network also includes third-party websites operated by Microsoft and Yahoo consortium search partners.
If you access our website via such an advertisement, a cookie is placed on your computer. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain subpages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been accessed on our website. The conversion cookie enables both Microsoft and us to track whether a person affected who came to our website via a Microsoft-Ads advertisement generated revenue, i.e., whether they completed or cancelled a purchase of goods.
A Microsoft UET tag is integrated into our website. This is a code used in connection with the cookie to store personal information, such as the web pages visited by the person concerned. Personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is therefore transferred to Microsoft in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States of America each time he or she visits our website. This personal data is stored by Microsoft in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
In addition, Microsoft may be able to track your usage across multiple electronic devices through cross-device tracking, enabling you to display personalized advertising on or in Microsoft webpages and apps.
You can disable this behavior at https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/ (Opt Out).
The person concerned can prevent the saving of cookies through our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. This Internet browser setting will also prevent Microsoft from setting a Microsoft Ads cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already stored by Microsoft Ads can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, the person concerned has the possibility to withdraw from interest-related advertising by Microsoft Ads. To do this, the person concerned must select the link https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/ from each of the Internet browsers they use and select the desired settings there.
For more information on Microsoft Ads' analytics services, please visit the Microsoft Ads website (https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/de/53056/2).

c) LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social network for building and maintaining professional business contacts and offers tailored search functions and tools as part of its talent, marketing and sales offering. Users create a career profile that can be viewed privately and publicly according to their own wishes and settings (see profile settings for data protection and opt out).
LinkedIn is operated by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.
As part of its service offering, LinkedIn collects public information (such as career-related news and achievements) and other content that may include information about the specific LinkedIn user (such as mentions in articles, posts, comments). You can choose to opt out of this. As a targeted social media network with millions of global users, LinkedIn is also a B2B advertising medium for companies through which different ad formats can be targeted to different users. LinkedIn does not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without the user's consent; see profile settings for advertisements and opt-out and opt-out for surveys and services).LinkedIn stores cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags, device identifiers) to recognize the user and his or her platform both off- and on the platform. Users can restrict this tracking within the display preferences under the Guest Controls.
Expert Systems AG operates its own LinkedIn profile to advertise career opportunities on the one hand, and to advertise specific Expert Systems products on the other. Every Expert Systems AG post on the company profile shows how many users have carried out a specific action organically or through paid advertising. Expert Systems AG also sponsors content via LinkedIn in the form of sponsored posts, text ads, and videos. In addition to the organic reach of the followers, these advertisements are aimed at specific target groups. Target groups can be created based on various targeting options, e.g. by location, professional title, skills, and interests. LinkedIn uses the user's own profile information and targets the individual user approvals that the user has configured in his profile. Expert Systems AG receives information on the effectiveness of advertisements by tracking user behavior via cookies and similar technologies. Depending on the advertising campaign, the LinkedIn Insight Tag and specific LinkedIn scripts installed on our homepage measure whether a specific product has been added to the shopping cart or purchased. If preferred, the user can limit this in the LinkedIn display settings.

When you visit our pages, the plugin establishes a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Facebook "Like" button while logged into your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our pages on your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to associate the visit to our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or of their use by Facebook.

With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our offer as a target group for the presentation of advertisements, so-called "Facebook ads". Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads we post only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our website. This means that with the help of the Facebook pixel we want to make sure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and are not a nuisance. The Facebook pixel also helps us track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by showing whether users have been redirected to our site after clicking on a Facebook ad.
The Facebook pixel is integrated directly by Facebook when you visit our websites and can store a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook when logged in, the visit to our site will be recorded in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us, so it does not provide us with any information about the identity of the user. However, Facebook stores and processes the data so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible. Facebook processes the data in accordance with Facebook's Data Usage Policy. Accordingly, you can find more information about how the remarketing pixel works and how Facebook ads are displayed in general in the Facebook Data Usage Policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
You can object to the collection by the Facebook pixel and use of your data to display Facebook ads. To do this, you can visit the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions on the settings for usage-based advertising: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads or declare the objection via the US page http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU page http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.

On the contrary, they help us provide more tailored and efficient services to you and are therefore beneficial to all parties. However, you still have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on this basis, as mentioned above.
User and customer data:
We must ensure that our business activities run smoothly, so that we can continue to provide you with our products and services of the usual quality and at a reasonable price. For this reason, we require your data in order to fulfill our contracts with you, to bill you for our services and supply you with our products, to answer your support queries and so that we can provide you with updates and patches for your software. Lastly, we also require your data in order to protect our intellectual property in the form of our software and content from misuse and piracy by using the data stored in your user account.

Evaluator data:
When you submit a review, we collect your personal data to prevent misuse (e.g. through multiple reviews).

2. Agreement
Under certain circumstances, we may need your consent to process your personal data in connection with certain activities. Depending on what exactly your data is needed for, we will either ask for your explicit consent via "opt-in" or silent consent via soft opt-in .
According to Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent (via opt-in) is classed as "any voluntary declaration of intent, in an informed and unequivocal manner, in the form of a declaration or other clear affirmative act, with which the person concerned indicates their consent to the processing of personal data concerning themselves". Put simply, this means that:
you must voluntarily give us your consent without us putting any kind of pressure on you;
you must know what you are granting consent for - we will therefore ensure that we have provided you with sufficient information; and
you must give us your consent in the form of a positive, affirmative act. In most cases, we will provide you with a field that you must mark so that this requirement is clearly and unambiguously fulfilled.
We keep a record of the consent that you have given in this way.
As previously mentioned, in some cases consent by soft opt-in is sufficient. We may advertise products and services that are related to the products we offer (especially our software and the content we offer) and services (for example in the hosting area), provided that you have not actively unsubscribed from these communications.
As previously mentioned, you have the right to revoke your consent to these activities. by contacting our data security officer
3. Assertion, exercise or defence of legal rights
Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data in connection to the pursuit or defence of legal claims. This may occur, for example, if we require legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are legally obliged to retain or disclose certain information in the course of legal proceedings.
