Privacy Statement | MPAC
Privacy Policy
The Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We manage the collection, retention and dissemination of personal and non-personal information in compliance with the requirements of the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Assessment Act and other applicable legislation, regulations and judicial and quasi-judicial rulings.
How MPAC Protects your Privacy
MPAC does not release personal information (i.e., recorded information about an identifiable individual), or any other data that would divulge an individual’s identity, except where required or permitted by law, or by court order. While MPAC may release aggregate information in the form of demographic studies constructed from the analysis of personal information, these studies do not identify individuals. Further, MPAC does not release actual income or expense information except where legally required or permitted to do so, or by court order.
Personal information that is stored and processed on MPAC’s information systems is protected by industry standard security, firewalls, password and user authentication, and encryption technology, as necessary. Only authorized persons may access MPAC’s information systems as required by their job responsibilities and only within the scope of administering legally authorized activities.  MPAC’s web services use high level secure socket layer (SSL) encryption that protects your personal information while in transit. MPAC’s technology safeguards are comparable to those used by leading financial institutions and government agencies. Any violation of MPAC’s privacy or security policies will result in swift and appropriate action, which may include referring violations to law enforcement authorities or the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, or disciplinary action against the individual(s) responsible for the violation.
While delivering services to you, we may contract with third-party service providers that operate either in Canada or in the continental United States.  We will only contract with reputable firms that adhere to strict privacy and security standards. While information may reside with or be processed by third-party service providers, MPAC requires that all service providers have similar levels of privacy and security as would apply to MPAC’s own information systems.
