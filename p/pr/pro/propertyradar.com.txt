Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about how You use our Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other information, including personal information, we collect about You.
Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a computer’s hard drive through a web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for You to navigate our Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track Your activities while using our Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if You prefer, You can edit Your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers provides information about how to prevent a computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify upon receiving a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If You disable cookies, You may be able to browse certain areas of the Services, but some features may not function (e.g., You may not be able to stay logged into Your account).
Clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also referred to as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track Your activities, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to You, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Local Storage Objects. We may use local storage objects (LSOs), such as HTML5 and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about Your use of the Services. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Services or to display advertising based upon Your web browsing activity may also use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information.
Third-Party Services
We use third-party analytics companies, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our Services. We also use third-party companies to enhance our Services, such as providing messaging and communication services. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, or LSOs, to perform their services. They use these tools to help understand use of, and to improve, our Services, performance, and user experiences. You can learn more about Google’s privacy practices in the Google Privacy Policy; in order to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, You can download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe’s private practices in the Stripe Privacy Policy.
Do Not Track Disclosure
Our Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please click here. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in the Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms section above (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Security
We have taken steps to help protect the personal information we collect. However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to Your device and account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping Your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on Your account via unauthorized password activity.
User Choices
Correcting or Deleting Personal Information. You may correct or request deletion of Your personal information by logging into Your account and updating Your information. Please note that we may retain certain information about You as required by law or as permitted by law for legitimate business purposes (e.g., in accordance with our record retention policies or to enforce our User Agreement).
Opting out of Email Communications. We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to You. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email or contacting us at the Contact Us information below. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If You opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may still send You non-promotional emails (e.g., about Your account with us).

Our Services are not targeted to children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems.
