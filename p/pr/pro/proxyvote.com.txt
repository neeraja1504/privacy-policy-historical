This Statement describes the practices that Broadridge will follow with respect to the personal information it collects from users of www.broadridge.com and other Broadridge websites, mobile applications, or hosted websites that link to this Privacy Statement.
What is personal information?
“Personal information” is information that can be used to identify or contact you. Personal information includes your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, as well as information you provide us about your interests and preferences.
In some cases, we operate or host websites owned by our clients, including banks, brokers, mutual funds and corporations or other business entities (the “Business Owner” of the website). On these hosted sites, we may also collect sensitive personal information that you provide, which for some services may include your account number and Social Security number, as well as information you provide when you access your account online or conduct transactions. All personal information and sensitive personal information collected via these hosted sites is considered “Confidential Information.”
How do we collect, use, and disclose personal information?
On Broadridge websites we collect personal information that you provide so that we may provide you or our clients with, or contact you about, products, services and information, to enhance your site visit or follow up with you after your visit.
If you provide personal information to us for our own use, we may use it to provide the products, services or information that you have requested and we may share it with our affiliates. We may also use your personal information for other internal business purposes, such as market research and legal compliance.
If you provide personal information or sensitive personal information to us via a hosted site, we treat that information as confidential and we only use it to perform the services requested by you or the Business Owner of the site. We may share your information with the Business Owner of the site, and also provide the Business Owner with information on your use of the website. If you have any questions regarding the Business Owner’s use of your personal information, please contact the Business Owner directly. Broadridge may use aggregate information or statistics about the use of its sites and the products and services used through its sites, but these statistics would not include personal information.
We may share any personal information, even Confidential Information, with our vendors and other third parties who perform services for us, but we forbid these companies from using your personal information for their own purposes.
Please note that we may always disclose any information as required by law, when necessary for health or safety purposes, or when needed to protect our legal rights, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate in accordance with applicable laws. For example, we may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our business.
Finally, if you are located outside the United States, your personal information will be maintained by us in the U.S. We may transfer your personal information to countries outside your location or the U.S. However, we assure adequate protection for your personal information in compliance with all applicable laws.
