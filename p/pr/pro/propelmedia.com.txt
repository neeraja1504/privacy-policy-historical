Propel Media - Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what information Propel Media, Inc. (“Propel Media”, also referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects from individuals who visit the PropelMedia.com website (the “Site”). The Privacy Policy also explains how Propel Media uses and maintains that information.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify the Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site under the tab “Privacy Policy” or other places on the Site that we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date indicated at the bottom of the Privacy Policy, so please review it frequently.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and not to information collected or obtained from other sources.
Information Collected
We collect two kinds of information through the Site. The first kind of information is Personally Identifiable Information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name and email address (“PII”). We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly (see “Collection of Personally Identifiable Information” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally.
If you do not want your information to be collected and used as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
PII is collected by the Site only when you provide it to us via the “Contact” page or the contact section on the bottom of PropelMedia.com, in which the Site asks for your name and email address so that you can receive a response to any questions you may have.
If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Privacy Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the Site features described above. By providing us with your PII through use of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Privacy Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Privacy Policy that we may publish on the Site.
Social Media Features and Widgets
The Site includes Social Media Features and Widgets (“Features and Widgets”), such as Propel Media profiles on Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin, or other interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These Features and Widgets may collect your PII via a login, IP address, and may set a cookie to enable these functions properly. Features and Widgets are hosted by a third party and therefore, your interactions with these Features and Widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolution of disputes, and enforcement of our agreements. You may update, correct, amend or request to remove your PII from our systems by emailing us at info@PropelMedia.com or by calling us at (866) 394-1786.

We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. We cannot and will not independently verify that all those who use the Site are at least 13 years old, but we will remove from our files any PII of anyone we discover to be under 13 years old.

We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. We may share your PII with our principals, officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, “Related Entities”). Neither we nor our Related Entities contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.
We and our Related Entities may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to comply with a court order, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users or the public.
We and/or our Related Entities may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Entities may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of client information; (b) assist in distributing emails; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; and/or (g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site. We and our Related Entities require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.
In addition, if we or our Related Entities go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the Site of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.
