These offers are provided by our carefully selected clients. It is our duty to always be transparent with you which is why we will always tell you who you are sharing your data with.

Assist with site operation and other communication services, share information with third-parties, including our vendors and contractors.
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data. We rely on your consent, our legitimate interest and at times, our legal obligations.
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent. We collect your consent when applicable law (including but not limited to The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation) requires it.
For example, when you tick a box to receive Product Testing UK email newsletters. Or when you opt-in to receive electronic communications from third parties. Or when you opt-in to receive messages from the ManyChat Bot on Facebook.
When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service and who your data may be passed to. You can withdraw your consent at anytime.
Users of our Site are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorised user. We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If we obtain actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.
For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity.
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of offering our service and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, if you are selected as a product tester, we’ll use your postal or email address to send you your gift card/reward or product to test.
We will also use your data to set you up an account so we can keep track of the offers you have signed up to in case you experience a problem with our site and we need to fix it, or you have a query about our site and we need to answer it. We also monitor our members’ accounts for fraudulent activity, for example, by looking out for duplicate entries/accounts which is against the Terms & Conditions of our site.
If you register your interest with a third party offer on our site that states you will receive a call, we will pass your telephone number (that you used to sign up to our site with) to the third party so one of their representatives can contact you regarding the offer, so long as your phone number is not registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). We will always tell you in the offer that, by registering your interest, you will receive a call.
Product Testing UK contain links to third party websites only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on our Site does not imply endorsement of the linked third party website by us. If you provide any personal information through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on the third party’s website (not the Site) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of that third party.
Product Testing UK holds your data in a UK database and only our highly trained and trusted staff can access your data on a need-to-know basis.
If you wish to contact us regarding your data, please see Section 5.
We only disclose your data to third parties if you have opted in to receive their services or direct marketing. Please be mindful of the fact that we do not accept any liability or responsibility for the marketing offers you sign up to with our clients and therefore we encourage you to read their Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policies that apply. You should be aware that, in some instances, our clients might be based in countries outside the European Union whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal data than that provided under EU Law. In such circumstance Product Testing UK will have in place contractual arrangements which will require your data to be transferred to the same standards as EU Law.
If you choose to sign up to receive emails from Product Testing UK, your name and email address will be passed to our 3rd party email service provider, Get Response. You can read their privacy policy and how they look after your data here **.  **
Except as provided above, under certain circumstances the force of law may require the provision of information to the legal authorities. In order to maintain the integrity of its website and safeguard the interests of its subscribers Product Testing UK will comply with any such legally binding request.
**                Right to Access**
You can access your data processed by us at any time. We will confirm what data is being processed, provide you with a copy of your data in addition to confirming your data rights.
If you wish to access your data, please submit a Subject Access Request (“SAR”) to our Data Protection Officer using reasonable means.

If you request for your data to be erased, then we will confirm whether this can take place and the next steps that we will take. If we cannot erase your data, we will explain why and confirm any actions required to allow us to do so.
Restrict Processing
If you make a restriction request, we will still store a copy of your data but cannot use this. We will inform you if the restriction needs to be lifted. You can make this request by email. If you request for your data to be restricted, we will confirm whether this can take place and the next steps that we will take.

Object to Processing
You can object to the processing of your data at any time. This right will only apply if we are using your data in relation to a legitimate interest. If you object, we will no longer process your data unless we have a compelling and legitimate reason not to do so (e.g. a legal obligation). In this case, you will be informed why we cannot stop processing your data.
Data Portability
You can request for us to transfer your data to another entity or person, where we are processing your data with your consent or in accordance with a contract. This will only apply to information which is processed by automated means (e.g. by a computer). Where feasible, we will send your data directly to another entity or person.
In exercising any of your rights, we will endeavour to act without undue delay but no later than one month. We will need to confirm your identity before completing any action on your behalf and reserve the right to not complete action until we are satisfied that it is you that is making the request. If we cannot complete your request, we will inform you within one month and explain why.
If you are not satisfied with our response or believe we are processing your personal data not in accordance with the law you can make a complaint to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can contact the ICO through their website:https://ico.org.uk/concerns/ or by telephone: 0303 123 1113.

By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies and other storage technologies.
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Other storage technologies you may come across include web beacons and pixels. A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image that is placed on our website or in an email that is used to monitor the behaviour of users visiting our sites or receiving our emails.

When a user visits our website and makes an action (for example, clicking on one of our ads), the Facebook Pixel placed on our website is activated and in turn triggers a cookie to send your action or Event Data to Facebook.
The cookie may also transfer your name, email address, phone number, date of birth or gender in a hashed format to Facebook. Facebook refers to this hashed data as Contact Information. (Hashed data is the processing of data in such a way that it cannot be attributed to a specific individual, usually, without the use of additional information.)
Your Contact Information is matched to the Event Data and is used to create a Custom Audience. A Custom Audience is a list of users that are grouped together by common Event Data.
Facebook will examine numerous data points of the Custom Audience and then build audiences similar to those users called a Look a Like Audience. Those users will then be shown ads that we think will be of interest to them. Your data is not passed on to any third parties other than Facebook.
