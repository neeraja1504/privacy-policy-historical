General
Cookies are small text files that are being saved on your computer when an Online Information is visited. In case you access this Online Information another time, your browser sends the cookies' content back to the respective offeror and, thus, allows the re-identification of the terminal device. Reading the cookies allows us to design our Online Information optimally for you and makes it easier for you to use them.
