Information Collected at Registration

First, we collect this information to validate all of our members. We want to create a positive and educational community which consists of contributing members and not spammers or artificial intelligence. In addition, we need to verify that all our users are 13 or over. We make every effort to protect the privacy of young children. If we discover that someone under the age of 13 has received membership, we will delete his or her account immediately.
Secondly, we collect this information so that we can personalize your experience. With the information we collect, we believe that we can better provide you with content that will better meet your needs.
