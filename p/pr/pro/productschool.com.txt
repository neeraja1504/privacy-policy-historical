What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser as you browse the internet. They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including on Product School Services. Cookies also allow us to remember things about your visits to Product School Services, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use.
We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Product School Services.
Why does Product School use cookies and similar technologies?
We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies when you visit our site and services through a browser. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.
We use cookies for the following purposes:
Authentication and security
·       To log you into Product School Services
·       To protect your security
·       To help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Product School’s agreements
For example, cookies help authenticate your access to Product School Services and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.
Preferences
·       To remember data about your browser and your preferences
·       To remember your settings and other choices you’ve made
For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country you’re in, so we can provide content in your preferred language without asking each time you visit.
Analytics and Research
·       To help us improve and understand how people use Product School Services
For example, cookies help us test different versions of Product School to see which features or content users prefer, web beacons help us determine which email messages are opened, and cookies help us see how you interact with Product School’s Services, like the links you click on.
We also work with analytics partners, including Google Analytics, who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them.
You can opt out of some of these services through tools like the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Advertising
·       To provide you with more relevant advertising
Please note that where advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising on other websites and applications, but it will not be tailored to your interests.To learn more about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html, or if you’re located in the European Union, visit the Your Online Choices site.
When using mobile applications you may also receive tailored in-app advertisements.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies by consulting your browser’s support articles. If you decide to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some interactive features in the Services.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, so your browser’s cookie-management tools may not remove them.
To get information and control cookies used for tailored advertising from participating companies, see the consumer opt-out pages for the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance, or if you’re located in the European Union, visit the Your Online Choices site.
