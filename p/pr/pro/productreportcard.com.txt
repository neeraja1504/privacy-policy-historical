The Third Party Technologies may be written, set, or read in various locations, including, without limitation, our servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and our client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, our client will send your UID and the specific survey, and we will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.
