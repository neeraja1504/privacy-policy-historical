WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?
When you visit our Web Site, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the Web Site. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our Web Site's content or services.
Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide.
We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you request.

HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with testing and related services and the information or content that you have requested, and, in some cases, to contact you about our programs, products, features or services.   If you are a test taker, Prometric will provide your information to the organization that owns the test you are taking (the "Test Sponsor").  Test Sponsor is that organization, who is a client of Prometric, and for who we are administering tests to you as the test taker.  Prometric will send your personal information and test results to that Test Sponsor so that the Test Sponsor may provide you with the accreditation, service, license or credential you seek.
