2. Collection, processing and utilization of personal data
If you use our website or interact with our website (for example fill in and submit the contact form), we collect, process and use personal data.
2.1. Personal Data
Personal data refers to data about the objective or personal affairs of a specified or specifiable natural person. This includes particularly information that allow for conclusions regarding your identity, for example your name, your telephone number, your address or e-mail address. Statistical data that we collect, for example, when you visit our website and which cannot be directly linked to your person, do not come under the concept of the personal date.
2.2. Informative Use
In the case of the mere informative use of the website, we do not collect any personal data, except for the data transmitted by your browser to enable you to visit the website. These are:
•IP address
• Date and time of the request
• Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
• Content of the request (concrete page)
• Access Status / HTTP status code
• The amount of data transferred
• Website from which the request comes
• Browser
• Operating system and its surface
• Language and version of the browser.
The IP addresses of the users are deleted or anonymised after the end of the usage. In the case of anonymization, the IP addresses are changed in such a way that the individual details about personal or objective affairs can no longer, or only with a disproportionate amount of time, costs and labor power, be assigned to a specified or specifiable natural person. The data in the so-called log files are evaluated anonymously by us in order to further improve the Project A website and to make it more user-friendly, as well as to find and correct errors more quickly. In addition, they are used to control the server capacities, in order to be able to provide corresponding data volumes in case of need.
2.3. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
The transfer of the data collected by Project A to third parties only takes place if this is necessary for the purpose of contract processing or settlement, or if you have previously given your consent. The data thus provided may only be used by our service providers to fulfil their task. These were carefully selected by us and commissioned in writing. They are bound by our instructions and regularly checked by us. Any other use of the information is not permitted and is likewise not carried out by any of our service providers.
3. Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your data carrier and store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to your computer. They aim at making the Internet offer more user-friendly and effective.
Basically, two different types of cookies exist, so-called session cookies, which are deleted, as soon as you close your browser (= end of the session) and temporary / permanent cookies, which are stored for an extended period or unlimited on your data carrier. This storage helps us to design our website and makes it easier for you to use it, by storing specific entries so that you do not have to repeat them all the time.
You may delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time and configure your browser settings according to your needs (for example, accepting third party cookies or rejecting all cookies). As a rule, you will be shown how to reject new cookies and delete already received ones in the menu bar of your web browser. However, we would point out that you may not be able to use all the features of our website.
3.1. Cookies at Project A
Most of the cookies we use are session cookies and are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of the browser session. In addition, we use permanent cookies that remain on your hard drive. During a subsequent visit the browser automatically recognizes that you were already with us and also, which inputs and settings you prefer. These cookies will be stored on your hard drive and will be deleted by itself after the specified time.
The cookies used by us are not assigned to any specific person and therefore not assigned to you. When the cookie is activated, an identification number is assigned to it. An assignment of your personal data to this identification number is not possible at any time. It does not store your name or similar data that would allow the allocation of a cookie to you.
4. Web Analysis
4.1. Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze the user behavior on websites. The information generated by cookies about the use of this website is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, your IP address is shortened before the usage statistics are evaluated, so that no conclusions can be drawn about your identity. Hereto, Google Analytics was extended on our website with the code "anonymizeIp" to ensure an anonymous capture of IP addresses.
Google will use the information obtained by the cookies to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activity for the website operators and to provide further services connected with the use of the website and the Internet. Google may also transfer this information to third parties, provided this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.

4.2. Google Tag Manager
To manage our websites and to incorporate cookie-based technologies, we use the service Tag manager, which is offered by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").

The Tag manager itself does not set cookies.

If you are a Facebook member, Facebook can link this information to your Facebook profile, provided that you do not disprove this in the privacy settings of your Facebook account, and use it to target Facebook ads.

When you visit our pages, the plug-in creates a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server.
