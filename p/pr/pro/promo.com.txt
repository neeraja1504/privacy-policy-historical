During your use of the Services, we may collect certain Personal Information delivered by you to us either as part of your registration to the Services or in any other way. This personal information may be updated by you from time to time. As a result of your use of the Services, you may supply us with such personal information as your name, e-mail address, uploaded content and metadata such as the source of that content (collectively, "Personal Information").

We reserve the right to use and share any aggregate and anonymized Information with third parties for any lawful purpose. We may associate your Information with non-Personal Information within our database and we treat all the associated information as your protected Information under this Privacy Policy. However, except as noted below, we do not share this associated your Information with third parties.

Legal Disclosures. In the event we are required to disclose Information and other related information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure.

You thus authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
