Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your browser type, the URL of the previous Web site you visited, the Web pages and advertisements you view or select, and the types of services you use. Non-Personally Identifiable Information also includes "Aggregate Information," which is described below in the section titled "How Do We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information?" We may automatically collect certain types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use the Site. We may also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you that you voluntarily provide (such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey) or post to a public area of the Site (such as a message board or chat room). **HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION?
Cookies.
**A cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your email address. We use cookies solely to keep track of which shopping cart belongs to you when you shop on our site. We use cookies only for the operation of our Site. **
IP Address.
** An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and to compile aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Site). When you visit a particular Web page on the Site, our servers log your IP address. Your IP address is not linked to your Personally Identifiable Information. IP addresses also help us to identify individual users within our live support system. **
Pixels.
** Pixels, also called clear GIFs, are invisible files on Web pages that you visit. If you visit a page on the Site that contains a Pixel, the Pixel communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement. We may use Pixels to serve advertising, enhance site functionality, and track usage of the Site. **HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We may also use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to (a) administer and manage your account, (b) pay commissions to you, (c) include you on our mailing lists and (d) advertise and promote our services. In addition, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that it is required by any applicable law or legal process, or if we believe we need to disclose it to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of our members, users, or other third parties.
