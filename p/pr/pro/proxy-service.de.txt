Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on and through our systems. Our Site is secure to the best of our abilities. We use our best efforts to keep our Site safe from unauthorized access, and to minimize the number of people who have access to sensitive information. We cannot absolutely guarantee the security of our Site, and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
