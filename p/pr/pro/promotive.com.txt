Our sites also uses “cookies” (small data files stored on your computer) and other tracking technologies to collect information about your visit to our sites. The cookies and tracking technologies we use do not capture Personally Identifying Information.

HOW WE USE COLLECTED PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
We may use the Personally Identifying Information we collect for the following purposes:
to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests;
to send you important information regarding our site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies, and/or other administrative information;
to send you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you, which you may opt-out of at any time;
to personalize your experience on our site by presenting content tailored to you;
to allow you to take and keep track of training;
for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our site, improving our services, identifying usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns;
for risk control, to comply with laws and regulations, and to comply with other legal process and law enforcement requirements;
to use information about your activities on the site to communicate your progress to your employers and in some cases to offer you retail discounts;
for other purposes which are disclosed to you and to which you consent.
We may also use information that we receive about you from your employer and data providers who assist us in processing requests, maintaining our data, and optimizing our services.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
We will not disclose your Personally Identifying Information to third parties except as described in this Policy, to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. You agree that we may also disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.
We may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to third party service providers that assist us with carrying out these purposes. For example, we may use a data processing contractor to operate computer systems on our behalf, for administrative, technical support, or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. Whenever any Personally Identifying Information is transferred to a such a third party service provider, that party will be contractually bound to use such Personally Identifying Information only to carry out the services we have requested, to abide by our Policy, and to provide adequate protection for the Personally Identifying Information.
We reserve the right to transfer any Personally Identifying Information we have about you in the event that we merge with or are acquired by a third party. We may disclose your Personally Identifying Information for any other purpose with your consent.
YOUR CHOICES FOR CONTROLLING YOUR INFORMATION
Correcting or Changing Your Information
We are concerned about the accuracy, currency, and completeness of the Personally Identifying Information we collect and take appropriate steps to ensure that the information we have is accurate and up-to-date. In addition to the options provided to you in this Policy, if you wish to review, amend, correct, update, or delete Personally Identifying Information we have collected about you online, or to opt out of receiving our marketing communications, contact us at: +1-866-376-4685 or http://www.3point5.com/action/feedback.

We will respond to your access request within any legally required time period or within 30 days. We reserve the right not to allow access to your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual might be violated.
You may cancel your registration to our sites and/or request the removal of your Personally Identifying Information from our visitor records by sending an email at http://www.3point5.com/feedback.

SECURITY
We use a variety of technologies and processes to protect Personally Identifying Information collected on the sites, including physical, technological, and organizational security measures.

We retain Personally Identifying Information that we collect only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements.
Some or all of the Personally Identifying Information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside of your country, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from those where you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain protections on the Personally Identifying Information that are equivalent to those in your country.

SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
We will not disclose your Personally Identifying Information to third parties except as described in this Policy, to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. You agree that we may also disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.
We may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to third party service providers that assist us with carrying out these purposes. For example, we may use a data processing contractor to operate computer systems on our behalf, for administrative, technical support, or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. Whenever any Personally Identifying Information is transferred to a such a third party service provider, that party will be contractually bound to use such Personally Identifying Information only to carry out the services we have requested, to abide by our Policy, and to provide adequate protection for the Personally Identifying Information.
We reserve the right to transfer any Personally Identifying Information we have about you in the event that we merge with or are acquired by a third party. We may disclose your Personally Identifying Information for any other purpose with your consent.
