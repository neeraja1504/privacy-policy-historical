Registration
When you register with PropertyWorld either as a user or a contributor the information you provide (i) allows us to send messages to you when managing enquiries online (ii) allows us to contact you with assistance, if necessary; (iii) allows us to verify the legitimacy of your entry or advertisement; (iv) enables us to customise the content of our site to meet your specific needs; and (v) enables us to analyse user trends and make product improvements to the Site and services offered.
General Information
The information with which users or contributors provide us, such as which areas are visited most frequently and which services users or contributors access the most is used in analysing the needs of Site visitors in general. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users or contributors and how we can continue to create a better overall user experience. We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand how PropertyWorld users and contributors use our site.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.
