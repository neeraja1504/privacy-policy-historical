Private information about our users, including names, email addresses, contact information, donation amounts, and other personal data are NOT marketed or sold to any outside party or parties, including the government. Unless we are subpoenaed to do otherwise, our customer's private information shall remain private.

We restrict access to personal information to ProCon.org employees and advisors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.
