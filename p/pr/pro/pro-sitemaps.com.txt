We use this email address to send important information related to your account (account activation, password reset, subscription status, notifications when sitemap is updated or expires). Every message has a link to unsubscribe from emails.
When a new website entry is added in your account, we store it's URL and PRO Sitemaps crawler bot starts sending requests to that website, finding all pages in order to create a sitemap.
When this process is completed we store the date and time of the session, the list of URLs and titles of all pages found on the website, the list of possible issues detected (such as broken links, pages skipped due to redirects), the list of links to external websites, the time it took to create the sitemap.
This information is used to provide sitemap files that can be submitted to search engines, and to provide you with detailed information about your website structure. We may use this information to improve our products and services.
When the "Auto Submit" feature is used we store the "token" provided by Google Sitemaps API to be able to submit sitemaps in Google Search Console under your Google account.
When an account is upgraded to a paid PRO subscription, we store the information provided by the payment processor (Paypal or Stripe), including transaction ID, date and time, amount of transaction. The name and address is stored in case it's included with payment information.
