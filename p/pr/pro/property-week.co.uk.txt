COOKIES POLICY
Your use of our web site indicates your consent to the cookies described in this policy.
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
A web cookie, a commonly used data collection technology, is simply a piece of text which can be placed on the browser of your personal computer or mobile device and subsequently read as you visit a web site. A cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular web site and then disappears when you close your browser, or it may be a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a period of time. Information from a cookie may be collected and used in aggregate form. Or data may be collected into an individual profile or record. That individual record may either be unique but anonymous, or the profile can be linked with information that identifies you as an individual.
You can learn more about cookies, generally, at www.allaboutcookies.org
HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?
We may use cookies for a number of purposes:
We may use a limited number of cookies essential to particular services you have requested or for security purposes. A few of our sites use a cookie for a shopping cart function when you purchase services or offerings. In particular, if you have registered for a site or use a customer portal we may use a cookie to authenticate the pc or mobile device that you are using.
We allow third parties to set analytics, or performance, cookies to collect and report aggregate information. These cookies provide reporting to us on an aggregate basis and so, do not identify you at all. We use the aggregate reports to understand how our web sites are used and improve their usefulness to our audiences.
A number of cookies also support how our web sites function, identifying your pc or end device on a unique but anonymous basis. These cookies may, for example, remember your language preferences or recognize an individual’s activity within a single session.
If you register for a site, we use a cookie to associate your presence with a specific user name and password or account. We may use a persistent cookie to recognize you automatically each time you return, but only if you ask us to do so. We may also use cookies to prepopulate your login or forms you fill out on the site with information you have already provided. Finally, we may use certain demographic information to enable third party ad servers (see below) to show you ads based on information about you in your business capacity, for example, your title within a company or the size of that company.
Some of sites may also allow third party ad servers to serve their own cookies to display advertising on our web sites. We do not determine, control or have access to their cookies. In addition, some of the ads they serve may generate their own cookies. We will list all cookies shortly so that you can review their privacy policies for more detail about their practices.

Our sites and services, or parts of them, may not work properly without these cookies.

But if you should wish to revoke that consent, or any part of it, at any time you may control cookies and third party ad targeting in the following ways.

THIRD PARTY
We will only disclose personal information about you internally, which includes any member of the Metropolis Group and to third parties for processing purposes associated with payment processing, the supply of goods and services, for web site administration, or elsewhere when you have consented to such disclosures, or where such disclosures are required or permitted by law. These third parties we contractually bound only to use personal information to perform the services that we hire them to provide. Where you have specifically agreed that we may do so, we may lease or rent your personal information to selected third parties for their postal marketing use.
TRANSFER OF DATA
Third party data processors, advertisers, exhibitors and other such business relationships outside of the EEA, are required to take adequate technical and organisational safeguards to protect personal information.
LEAD GENERATION PRODUCTS
In the case of your use of one of our LEAD GENERATION products, e.g. Directory Sites, Webinars, videos requiring registration etc, we may pass the information you provide to third parties. Generally this will be via a process whereby you, as the user, interact with a third party eg: click on an asset branded and provided by a third party. In some instances, for example, a products listing site, you may reach out directly to a supplier or exhibitor who may contact you in return. In other instances our lead generation products are sponsored and, in such cases the data you provided to us will be given to the sponsor. Generally, we will let you know at the time of collection if a product is sponsored.
If you wish to change your contact preferences with an individual exhibitor/sponsor, please follow their own unsubscribe request details. Unsubscribing to the Metropolis will stop Metropolis from contacting you in the future, but not the individual 3rd parties whom you have interacted with.
We take your contact preferences very seriously. If you would prefer for your details not to be passed to any 3rd parties as laid out in this section, you are advised not to register for the virtual product.
EMAIL CAPTURE
Metropolis may from time to time send updates about this product and other relevant Metropolis products and services. Your email will not be given to 3rd parties unless you have given your explicit consent for us to do so. By providing your email address you consent to being contacted by email for direct marketing purposes by Metropolis. Some of which will contain third party advertising.
MOBILE PHONE CAPTURE
Metropolis may from time to time contact you about this product and other relevant Metropolis products and services. By providing your mobile number you consent to being contacted for direct marketing purposes via voice calls or SMS by Metropolis.

We use administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised uses, access or modifications. Certain areas of our web sites may be password protected. If you are a user of our web sites and have a password, you can help to preserve your privacy by ensuring that you do not share your password with anyone else. Payments made via our web sites or other third party providers are processed in a secure environment.
We take steps to regularly validate the personal information we hold to ensure that the information is accurate and, where necessary, up to date. Information that is no longer required for any valid business purpose, and that we are not required to keep pursuant to any applicable law, will be routinely destroyed by secure means.
MAKING AUTOMATED DECISIONS
We do not ordinarily use personal information for the purposes of automated decision making. However, we may do so in order to fulfil compelling obligations imposed by law, in which case we will inform of any such processing and provide you with an opportunity to object.
