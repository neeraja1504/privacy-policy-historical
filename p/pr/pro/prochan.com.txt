This Privacy Policy, which applies to all websites and services provided under the ProChan names and marks, explains how ProChan treats personal information that we collect and receive. Personal information is information about you, not otherwise publicly available, that personally identifies you; personal information may include your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information.
ProChan has established registration and sign-in procedures which, in conjunction with this Privacy Policy, help ensure the privacy of information provided to ProChan by its visitors and members while using the ProChan website. You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies only to the ProChan website and services, and not to any other websites you may visit before or after the ProChan site.
What Does the ProChan Privacy Policy Cover?
This privacy policy applies to web pages ending in prochan.com that contain a link to this privacy policy at the bottom of the web page. Inclusion of the ProChan logo at the top of a web page does not necessarily mean that this privacy policy applies.
