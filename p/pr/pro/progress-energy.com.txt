At any time, you may opt out of providing such personal information by simply not providing it or by discontinuing your use of our website or mobile website. (Please note: Even if you choose not to have an online account with us, we will still store some of your personal information in our billing system if you are our customer. If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.)

Appended Information
During the Start Service process, Duke Energy supplements/appends the information you provide with additional data received from third-party sources. This supplemental information helps us to verify, update and correct the information our customers provide as well as helps us determine if a deposit will be needed in order to provide you with services.
Automatic Collection of Information
We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our website, mobile website, emails and online advertising to monitor proper functionality, determine areas for continuous improvement and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. We collect information such as the number of visits to our site and mobile website, mobile device identifier and operating system, the amount of time visitors spend on the site and mobile website, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site. This information is gathered automatically and we store it in log files.
Examples include internet protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring websites, exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data, meaning the path you take to navigate through our webpages.
To collect this information, we use tracking technologies like cookies and clear gifs (aka web beacons/web bugs). These technologies may be invisible to you, and we analyze the information collected only in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals. We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in emails that you receive from us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track nonpersonal information about visitors to our site. This information is collected in the aggregate and is used to track usage and volume statistics. The use of cookies by our third-party tracking service is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
These third-party technologies may also be used to collect nonpersonal information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests on this and other websites. These third-party technologies may use cookies or similar tracking technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
We use "cookies" to recognize you as you use or return to our websites or mobile website. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or email may save to your browser and store on your hard drive. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our shopping cart. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. To remove persistent cookies, follow directions provided in the internet browser's "help" file.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our website or mobile website, but your ability to use some areas of our websites or mobile website, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

Links to Non-Duke Energy Sites
**
For the convenience of our users, some pages of our website and mobile website offer you the ability to link to and view pages of websites not operated or controlled by Duke Energy (such as weather and financial information). Often, but not always, you can tell that you have linked to a non-Duke Energy website because a separate browser window will open. If you use such links, you will leave the Duke Energy website. Links by Duke Energy to such external websites do not imply endorsement by Duke Energy of that company, its site or its privacy policy, which may differ from Duke Energy’s practices. Duke Energy and its affiliates do not monitor or control the content or the privacy policies of the external sites, and they are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of linked external websites. When using a link to a non-Duke Energy website, we recommend that you investigate the privacy practices and policies of such external site. Any use of external links is at the sole discretion of the user.

When an update is made, the date at the top of this page changes to reflect the date new content was posted. You may want to visit this website and mobile website periodically to review the current Privacy Policy. Use of our website and mobile website after the posting of a revised privacy policy constitutes your agreement with the revised policy.
