Privacy policy
Dear Customer
Belgacom understands that privacy is very important for you, and we do our best to respect it.
That is why your personal data is only used by the Belgacom group; it is never communicated, without your prior
consent, to third parties for commercial purposes.
At the same time Belgacom commits to always keeping you informed about its special offers and promotions that
are likely to interest you. However, if you do not wish to receive commercial messages from us, you can easily indicate
this anytime you want via one of the many communication channels (email, 0800 number, web), and we will make sure
that your choice is respected.
The sections below detail how Belgacom handles your personal data when you use our services, such as fixed and
mobile telephony, the Internet, Belgacom TV and our other audiovisual services, and when you visit our websites
belgacom.be, belgacom.com, skynet.be and m.skynet.be.

Collection and use of personal data
If you want to use our services, you may be asked for some personal data, such as your first and last name, address,
login, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile number, date of birth, language, and a copy of your identity card. We
may also ask for other data which we need to deliver the service, such as specific preferences and requirements related
to the service concerned.
Personal data can be collected through various channels: e.g. orally in the Belgacom points-of-sale, by telephone via
the customer service, in writing via order forms or via electronic forms on the websites or via SMS. We can collect your
personal data when you place an order, take part in a survey or competition, call the customer service, subscribe to a
newsletter, or ask us for information. Your bill and payment data is also stored.
In addition, we collect data on your use of our services and websites and on the communication traffic that flows
through our network. Communication traffic can include the called fixed-line and mobile numbers, and the date, time
and duration of a call or Internet connection. We can also use socio-demographic data that we buy from specialized
agencies.
The personal data you enter via these different channels is stored in files held by Belgacom SA under public law (27 Bd.
du Roi Albert II, B-1030 Brussels). This data is used to deliver the required service or information, to establish and bill
the connection with the electronic communication networks of other operators, for customer administration, to draw up
and distribute telephone guides and offer directory assistance, to market the telephone numbers and addresses
mentioned in the telephone guides, for dispute management, to combat fraud and infringements committed against
Belgacom, its employees, customers or suppliers, to improve the quality of the services, for the planning and
organization of the telecommunications infrastructure, for market research and customer profiling, and to provide
information about our products, services and offers. All the data we collect can be combined to better adapt our offers
to your personal needs.
If you do not wish to receive any information about our products and services, or if you do have a specific preference
regarding the communication channels we use to inform you, or if you do not want us to adapt our offer to your usage
pattern, you can find out how to prevent this in the "Your wish for privacy" section.
The personal data are stored for up to 10 years after a person has ceased to be a Belgacom customer. Shorter storage
times apply to certain types of data, such as traffic data related to communications and connections, which are only
kept for 12 months.
According to the law, all processing of consumer data has been notified to the Commission for the Protection of Privacy.
Belgacom’s identification number for these notifications is HM 133424. Notification has been filed for several purposes,
such as customer management, direct marketing, market research, customer profiling, litigation management, fraud
combating, telephone directories, trade in personal data and camera surveillance.
Secrecy of telecommunications
The content of the communication traffic that flows through our network as fixed and mobile telephone calls, e-mails,
SMS messages and your surfing behavior on the Internet on other websites than those belonging to Belgacom, is
protected by the laws concerning the secrecy of telecommunications. This means that Belgacom and its employees may
not have any knowledge of such content. Belgacom has taken the necessary security measures and given strict
instructions to its employees to respect the secrecy of telecommunications.
The telephone calls you make to our customer service may be recorded to serve as evidence in case of a dispute about
a commercial transaction. Said telephone calls can also be recorded and listened to by a quality control monitor.
Securing your personal data
We have taken technical and organizational measures to protect the databases in which your data is kept against
unauthorized access, unauthorized use, theft or loss. Our security measures are regularly evaluated and adapted so
that we can continue to provide a high level of protection.
Disclosure of personal data to third parties
Some of our databases may be accessible to third parties working for us or assisting us with the performance of our
tasks, e.g. our partners or call centres who sell Belgacom services in our name and on our behalf. Such third parties
only have access to this data on a need-to-know basis, to enable them to perform their task on our behalf.
Your personal data and the data on the Belgacom products and services you use, can be shared with the subsidiaries of
the Belgacom Group to keep you informed about the products and services of the entire Belgacom Group. In case of
non-payment, we can inform our subsidiaries about your payment habits in order to protect the interests of the
Belgacom Group.
If you agreed to have your fixed-line and/or mobile number listed in the telephone guide and/or in the directory
assistance file, we will pass this data on to Directory Information Services, a Belgacom department which deals with the
telephone guides and the 1405 directory assistance service. You can ask for changes to your listing by calling the toll-
free number 0800 98 022 (NL) or 0800 98 033 (FR) or via an e-mail to gids@1207.be or annuaire@1307.be.
If you submit a complaint via the telecommunications ombudsman's service, for the handling of your complaint, we
may have to pass on your data to the ombudsman's service.
For the rest, we do not give the collected data to third parties, unless we explicitly state that this is required for a
specific action, or unless we are required by law to provide said data, e.g. at the request of the competent legal
authorities in the framework of a judicial enquiry.
