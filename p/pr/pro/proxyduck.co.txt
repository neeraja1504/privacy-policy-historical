Our Commitment – Privacy by Design
We follow the Neustar Privacy Principles, including the principle of Privacy by Design, to design, build, and deliver products and services that respect your privacy.
Personal Information Collection, Use, and Disclosure
We collect Personal Information from you directly and from businesses that use our products and services. We use registration data, including Personal Information, supplied by our online Match Partners to set AdAdvisor Cookies and/or Aggregate Knowledge Cookies, which do not contain or convey Personal Information. Finally, we collect and use Personal Information and other demographic data from a variety of sources such as telephone directories, the US Postal Service, the Census Bureau, and from other third parties. We do not use Sensitive Personal Information without your permission.

Cookies, Advertising IDs and Other Technologies
Neustar may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, javascript, HTML5 local storage, or similar technologies, along with other information described in our Privacy Policy to enhance and personalize your experience on our sites and to manage and enable preferences, transactions and related uses of Neustar services and information. In addition, we use Mobile Advertising IDs, also known as IDFA or IFA, in connection with PlatformOneSM and other marketing services. Third parties with whom we partner may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, javascript, HTML5 local storage, or Flash LSOs to help us understand how visitors interact with our website or to deliver content, such as videos, or to personalize ads you see online based on your visits to our website.

Cookies
You can opt out of the use of AdAdvisor Cookies and AK Cookies for Neustar Marketing Services on the Opt-Out page of our website.
You can also opt out of the use of AdAdvisor Cookies and AK Cookies for Neustar Marketing Services by using the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) tool on the http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ page.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising served by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Choice tool by visiting http://aboutads.info/choices.
Mobile Advertising IDs
Apple’s iOS IDFA can be reset by the user at any time. Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising. You can learn how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device or to reset your IDFA here: IDFA Opt-Out.
Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android devices pass Google Advertising ID, which provides the same type of device-specific, unique, resettable ID for advertising as Apple IDFA or IFA. You can learn more about how identifiers on mobile are used for advertising and receive instruction for how to opt out of mobile advertising on the Google Privacy & Terms webpage.
Please note that opting out does not mean you will block online advertising altogether or see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads that you see will not be personalized for you. Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.
Your choice to opt out from the use of AK and AdAdvisor cookies will not affect ads placed by any other organization.
We comply with opt-out requests by placing an “opt-out cookie” on your computer or device. Consequently, if you clear your cookies on that computer or device, we will not be able to read our “opt-out cookie” and will resume collecting information from that computer or device for purposes of retargeting. Similarly, an opt-out request will not be effective on other browsers, computers, or devices you may use if you have not opted out while using that browser, computer, or device.
Accountability
Neustar is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and adheres to each organization’s Codes and Principles.

For information about the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and to learn more about the Ad Choices icon, visit http://www.aboutads.info/ and http://youradchoices.com/.
