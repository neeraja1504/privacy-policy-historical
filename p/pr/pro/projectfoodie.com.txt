“Cookies” Information :  When you access the Site, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.  Project Foodie may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
“Automatically Collected” Information :  When you access the Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.  This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Site, and the dates and times that you visit the Site.
2.      How Project Foodie Uses Information :
Project Foodie uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Site updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site.
Project Foodie uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Site works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
Project Foodie may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to:  (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Site; (b) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (c) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
