About IP Addresses
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. This address is used to serve the pages that you request to your computer. IP addresses are used by us to count unique visitors, to diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. They are also used to report anonymous aggregate information to third parties. Your IP address is not connected to your personal information and so, when we use IP-related data, we are looking at a logged user session but we do not know who you are.
About Cookies
Cookies are used by many sites including ProFootballWeekly.com to customize your experience on the site. To do this, bits of information called cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive for tracking purposes. You may disable cookies on your computer; however if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features of our site.
Anonymous Aggregate Information
As part of the tracking process, ProFootballWeekly.com will collect anonymous aggregate information and may share it with advertisers and affiliates for the purpose of providing the most beneficial content possible to our visitors. This information includes such items as the number of visitors to the site, access times, referring web site addresses and demographic information (such as age, gender, etc.), all of an anonymous nature.
Personal Information
There are many things that can be done on our site without providing any personal information to us at all. There are also instances where we may offer you the opportunity to register for premium services, complete a survey online or to enter a contest or a sweepstakes. In these situations, we may ask you to provide personal information such as email address, full name, street address, telephone number, hobbies, and preferences. This information will be used to contact you or for internal purposes and will not be shared with any party outside of Pro Football Weekly.
We also may use personal information to display custom, personalized content to our visitors or to send newsletters, emails, promotional materials and other updates on a periodic basis. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information.

Children's privacy
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States does not allow the collection of any personal information from anyone under the age of 13 who resides in the United States. Therefore, children under 13 should not submit any information about themselves via forms. We will not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you submit such personal information, you warrant that you are over the age of 13 and are not subject to COPPA.
