We are committed to maintaining the highest levels of security and protection for our users.

Our website is scanned on a regular basis for potential security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our Site as safe as possible. We use regular Malware Scanning. All transactions are processed through an industry-recognized secure credit card gateway and we do not store any of your financial information on our servers.
Your Personally Identifiable Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all PII you supply to us is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology when transmitted. SSL encrypts your information to avoid the decoding of that information by any unauthorized parties. To check the security of your connection, please see the closed lock in your browser. This means the SSL is active and working.
We take the security of your Personally Identifiable Information seriously and use reasonable electronic, personnel and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration or misuse. However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate risks. We can not guarantee or warrant the security of any Information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify you as necessary and to the extent possible so you can take appropriate protective steps.
Do we use 'cookies'?

We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf. We reserve the right to use cookies for purposes not listed here as needed in the future.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this Personally Identifiable Information confidential. We may also release Personally Identifiable Information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.
However, Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
We reserve the right to transfer or assign all Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected via the Site to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, liquidation, change in control, or other sale of all or a portion of our assets.

Mobile Device Additional Terms
Geo-Locations Informations: Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for company to determine from an IP address the geographical location of your point of connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Push Notifications: We may send you push notifications if you choose to receive them. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications you may turn them off in your device’s settings.
Mobile Analytics: We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device.

Social Media
We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Site to your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Site. When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the Information you have made publically available on the social networking Site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age, locale and any other information you have made public. By connecting your account on the Site to your account on any social networking Site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information posted on that account about you to us. Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on its system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking Site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.
We may use hyperlinks on the Site which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as a Facebook’s "Like" or "Share" button, Twitter’s "Tweet" button or Pinterest’s "Pin" button, that particular social network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers. If you do use these buttons on the Site, the respective social network will possibly receive PII and non-PII, including your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the Site. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within our control.
California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit our Site anonymously.
We will include a link to this privacy policy on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our privacy policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
You will be notified of any privacy policy changes through an adjustment made on our privacy policy page.
You can change or update your Personally Identifiable Information by:
Emailing us at support@promgirl.com.
Calling us at (302) 279-1052.
Logging in to your account.
Chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket.
COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information at our Site from those who we know to be under the age of 13, and we do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
CAN-SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have commercial emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to:
Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.
Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our customers after the original transaction has occurred.
To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:
Not to use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
To identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
To include the physical address of our business or Site headquarters.
We monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
We honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
You may at any time unsubscribe from receiving future emails in the following ways:
Follow the instructions at the bottom of one of our emails and we will promptly remove you from our email list.
Log in to your account on the Site and update your email preferences.
We reserve the right to send you transactional or relationship based emails or notices even if you opt out of all voluntary emails. This includes information about your account, such as information regarding delivery of goods and services you have already agreed to and ordered, service announcements and administrative messages, information about warranty, recall, safety or security information, or notices about changes in terms or features of the Site.
