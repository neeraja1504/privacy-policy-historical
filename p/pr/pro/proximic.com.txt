This Privacy Policy describes Comscore’s practices as they relate to the collection, use, and disclosure of information gathered from visitors to the Website and application that link to this policy. Comscore operates a number of research panels, each of which is governed by the privacy policy that appears on the Website assigned to that research panel.
What information is collected?
Personal Information.  Comscore collects Personal Information about you when you choose to provide such information to us. For example, you may provide us with Personal Information when you submit an online form, apply for a job, communicate with us by e-mail, or access client-specific content. This information may include your name; business or personal contact information, such as your address, email address or phone number; and any information that you provide as part of a job application (collectively, “Personal Information”).
Data Collected Automatically.   We automatically collect certain information about your use of our Website and application. This information may include, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version, your device identifier, information about your computer and operating system, the length of your visit and the pages that you viewed on our Website or application. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect this information. We also use cookies and similar technologies for other purposes such as to ensure authorized access to client-specific content, and to track client access to such content. Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user’s hard drive that contain information about a user. Please note that you may be able to view and delete these cookies using the features of your browser; however, deleting cookies may prevent you from being able to use the full functionality of the Website.

Information Collected by Third Parties.   We may permit third parties to use cookies or other technology to collect information about your online and application usage activities across our Website and application and other websites and applications over time for non-advertising purposes such as to help us analyze how visitors use our Website and application. We may use Google’s analytics products to provide these services. To learn more about how these Google products collect and process data and the choices Google may offer to control these activities, you may visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

Information Collected for Market Research.   This Website may set tags on your browser that collect data for the ScorecardResearch service, a service offered by Full Circle Studies, Inc.

You may control your level of participation in ScorecardResearch’s market research programs by visiting here: http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx. We will continue to count the fact that a browser came to a site, but we will not associate that event with your browser. Additionally, if your mobile device platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in our market research programs with respect to our data collection from applications on that mobile device.
Please note that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out). If you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective.
