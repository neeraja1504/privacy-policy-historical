TL;DR - read a US Secret Service subpoena and our reply.
Summary Without the Legalese!
Our privacy policy is closely aligned with our philosophy on free speech, free press, and the right to anonymity.
We log only amount of bandwidth you use, not URLs, content or anything else about how you use your accounts.
We don't track what you do with your VPN/proxy services. We don't sell your data or personal info, even if you provide it.
We don't advertise.
We don't do affiliates marketing.
If you use one of our free products or services, we don't collect any information about you.
If you use our support system, this systems ask for an email address in order to notify you of replies. You are encouraged to use a disposable email address for this purpose, although we will never share or sell that address, give it to a 3rd party unless required by law, nor send any emails to it except reply notifications.
If you use one of our paid services, we collect the minimum information possible in order only to bill you. For example, we cannot bill a credit card without a name. If we did collect billing information from you, that information (except your email address) is not stored by us. It is stored by our payment provider, Recurly. Their privacy policy is here. We also accept digital currencies (bitcoin, ethereum, etc) if you'd prefer not to divulge any information about yourself. Contact us for wallet addresses since we are not integrated with our payment processor's digital currency system.
If you use one of our paid services, we ask for an email address. You are encouraged to use an anonymous email address. We use this email address only to provide you with account information, and to alert you of changes to your account information.
If we did collect minimal billing information from you during checkout, we will never share or sell it. We will never give it to a 3rd party unless required by law. We will never market to you directly unless you expressly opt-in when making a purchase or when setting the marketing preference in the control panel. Once again, if we did collect billing information from you, that information (except your email address) is not stored by us. It is stored by our payment processor, Recurly.
Automatic renewal of service will only occur if you opt-in when making a purchase or when setting the automatic-renewal preference in the control panel.

We do not log anything on our VPN/proxy servers except amount of bandwidth used by your account (identified by your username only, not email address or IP address). We collect bandwidth usage to properly load-balance our servers. Load-balancing is required to maintain a good level of service for all customers. We do not log anything else , including information about you, the sites you visit, or anything about the way in which you use our servers. You can see example an example log file in our FAQ.
Information We Collect When You Use FoxyDNS (because we can't avoid it)
If you use our FoxyDNS product, we record your IP address. This is done so that FoxyDNS is only available to our paying customers. It is not technically possible to lock down FoxyDNS to a username or email address, only to an IP address. You can avoid us recording your IP address by using your VPN/Proxy Service in conjunction with FoxyDNS. In this case, we collect the IP address of the VPN/Proxy server instead.
