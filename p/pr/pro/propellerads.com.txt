The right to erasure
(The right to be forgotten)
**** |
You can request that we delete your data provided the legal requirements have been met. In accordance with Article 17 the GDPR, this can be the case if:
the data are no longer required for the purposes they were acquired or otherwise processed;
you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
you object to the processing of your data and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing or you object to data processing for the purposes of direct advertising;

The right to data portability
