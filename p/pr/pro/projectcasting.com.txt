Data Use Policy
We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:
Your information
Your information is the information that’s required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.
Registration information
When you sign up for Project Casting, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender. In some cases, you may be able to register using other information, like your telephone number.
Information you choose to share
Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Project Casting, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a friend’s story.
It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Page or a website, add a place to your story, use our contact importers, or indicate you are in a relationship.
Your name, profile pictures, cover photos, gender, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public.
Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements.
Information others share about you
We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a group.
When people use Project Casting, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts.
Other information we receive about you
We also receive other types of information about you:
We receive data about you whenever you interact with Project Casting, such as when you look at another person’s timeline, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, use a Project Casting mobile app, or make other purchases through Project Casting.
When you post things like photos or videos on Project Casting, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access Project Casting, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include your IP address and other information about things like your internet service, location, the type (including identifiers) of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby.
We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Project Casting Platform or visit a site with a Project Casting feature (such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you’re on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Project Casting, your User ID.
Sometimes we get data from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Project Casting better. For example, an advertiser may tell us information about you (like how you responded to an ad on Project Casting or on another site) in order to measure the effectiveness of – and improve the quality of – ads.
We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends. For example, we may put together data about you to determine which friends we should show you in your News Feed or suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you.
When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications.
We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people’s data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
Public information
When we use the phrase “public information” (which we sometimes refer to as “Everyone information”), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.
Information you choose to make public
Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of Project Casting, will be able to see it.
Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, timeline, User ID, username, etc.) even off Project Casting;
can show up when someone does a search on Project Casting or on a public search engine;
will be accessible to the Project Casting-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and
will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs such as our Graph API.
Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you write on a Page’s wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.
When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.
Information that is always publicly available
The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.
Name
This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always delete your account.
Profile Pictures and Cover Photos
These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete it. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.
Network
This helps you see whom you will be sharing information with before you choose “Friends and Networks” as a custom audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network .
Gender
This allows us to refer to you properly.
Username and User ID
These allow you to give out a custom link to your timeline or Page, receive email at your Project Casting email address, and help make Project Casting Platform possible.
Usernames and User IDs
A Username (or Project Casting URL) is a custom link to your timeline that you can give out to people or post on external websites. Usernames appear in the URL on your timeline. We also use your User ID to identify your Project Casting account.
If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the my.projectcasting.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type my.ProjectCasting.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you’ve let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you through our APIs, such as our Graph API. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, language and country.
How we use the information we receive
We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:
as part of our efforts to keep Project Casting products, services and integrations safe and secure;
to protect Project Casting’s or others’ rights or property;
to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;
to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to you;
to make suggestions to you and other users on Project Casting, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and
for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Project Casting as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don’t share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
received your permission;
given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.
Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.
We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices.
We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend’s pictures to information we’ve put together from the other photos you’ve been tagged in. This allows us to make these suggestions.
Deleting and deactivating your account
If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.
Deactivate
Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your timeline, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.
Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated.
Deletion
When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Project Casting. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. You can delete your account by e-mailing info@projectcasting.com
Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on Project Casting aren’t stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.
Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. Pixels are small blocks of code on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage and often are used in connection with cookies.
We use technologies like cookies, pixels, and local storage (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more information) to provide and understand a range of products and services.
We use these technologies to do things like:
make Project Casting easier or faster to use;
enable features and store information about you (including on your device or in your browser cache) and your use of Project Casting;
deliver, understand and improve advertising;
monitor and understand the use of our products and services;
to protect you, others and Project Casting.
For example, we may use them to know you are logged in to Project Casting, to help you use social plugins and share buttons, or to know when you are interacting with our advertising or Platform partners.
We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a cookie, pixel or other similar technology placed by Project Casting or the third party (although we would not share any other information that identifies you with an advertiser).
Most companies on the web use cookies (or other similar technological tools), including our advertising and Platform partners. For example, our Platform partners, advertisers or Page administrators may use cookies or similar technologies when you access their apps, ads, Pages or other content.
Cookies and things like local storage help make Project Casting work, like allowing pages to load faster because certain content is stored on your browser or by helping us authenticate you to deliver personalized content.
Refer to your browser or device’s help material to learn what controls you can often use to remove or block cookies or other similar technologies or block or remove other data stored on your computer or device (such as by using the various settings in your browser). If you do this, it may affect your ability to use Project Casting or other websites and apps.
