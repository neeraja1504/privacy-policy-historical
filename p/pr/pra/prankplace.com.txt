We do have a weekly email newsletter.
We do publish a weekly "fun-letter" which contains new product annoucements, special offers, sales and other prankplace news. When you order from us, we do add your email address to our customer list so you will automatically receive the fun-letter. If you wish not to receive the fun-letter, simply add a comment to your order, requesting to be excluded.
We have an order form.
We require information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and possibly financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). If we have trouble processing an order, we use the information to contact the user. This information is also used:
•for shipping and billing purposes.
•to fill customer´s orders.
•to facilitate our customers' transactions with our third party marketing partners. From time to time we may market certain third party services through our site. Should you choose to accept an offer from a third party, we will pass your relevant personal information, including your name, postal address and your credit/debit card number, to that third party.
We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors of this feature through a pop-up screen on our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.
We publish a newsletter (ezine), and we never sell or share our subscribers' email addresses without their consent.
