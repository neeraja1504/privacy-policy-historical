We have implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its users, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that we will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on our behalf.
NeuroGym has designated responsibility for your personal information to its Senior Director of Operations, who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy. Other NeuroGym individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Senior Director of Operations.

If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us.
4. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information
NeuroGym limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. NeuroGym does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen and have adopted techniques to ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). COPPA and its accompanying regulations under United States federal law protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Our site includes content that may be unsuitable for children under thirteen and which are not necessarily monitored. We encourage all parents to talk to their children about online safety and to monitor their children’s use of the Internet.
5. Information Collected Automatically
NeuroGym uses "cookies" to obtain certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as the Internet Protocol and referring web site addresses, browser type and domain name, when a web browser accesses our site or advertisements and other content served by us or on our behalf on other web sites.

6. Disclosure, Processing and Retention
We do not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to anyone else, except:
(a) to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 3, above);
(b) to NeuroGym' employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, joint venturers, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on our behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;
(c) as necessary if NeuroGym has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with NeuroGym' rights or property, other users of the Website, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and
(d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.
In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that NeuroGym or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

7. Accuracy of Personal Information
We will use reasonable efforts to keep personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate user decisions based on such information.

8. Security Safeguards
NeuroGym will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user's personal information.
9. Access to Personal Information

NeuroGym
PO BOX 5005, #138

If NeuroGym is not able to provide access to some aspect of a user's personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as: that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney-client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.
Users have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate, by contacting NeuroGym at info@myneurogym.com. NeuroGym will promptly correct such personal information.
