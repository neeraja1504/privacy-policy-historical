In the simplest terms, it is our desire to protect your information and only use it as necessary for your ease and benefit as you interact with us.  We have provided you with some a short summary of what that looks like, along with the longer version that provides all the specifics and details.  As always, if you have questions, please contact us.
For your protection, all personal information that we gather from your account is safely stored on our secure server. PraiseCharts does not sell or lend its contact list to any other business.

We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services and/or buy our Products.

However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Products and Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be and how they work:
Account related information is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account information, purchases of Products, information requests, customer service requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.

To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.
3.6 Website analytics. We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as Facebook Analytics, Google Analytics, MOZ, Optimziely, Hotjar, etc to collect information about how you interact with our Site, Products and Services, including what pages you visit, how much time you spend on each page, and IP information. We use the information provided by these tools to improve our Services. These tools place persistent cookies in your browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Site. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the specific service provider (ex: Facebook for Facebook Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside. These services use technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices (in particular device's IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website). They then store this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Though information collected does not include personal information such as name, address, billing information, etc., the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies. You can control the technologies we use by managing your settings through Privacy Settings or the ‘cookie banners” that may be presented when you first visit our webpages, or by utilizing settings in your browser or third-party tools, such as “Disconnect” and others. As well, you can opt-out to the creation of a Hotjar user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about your usage of our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites by following this opt-out link.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this section.

These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing.

10.0'DO NOT TRACK' NOTIFICATIONS
Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a “Do Not Track” signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.
