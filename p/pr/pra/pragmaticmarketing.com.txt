Your California Privacy Rights. California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personal Data has been shared with third parties for use in direct marketing purposes. There is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s Personal Data to third parties for use in direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their Personal Data to third parties for such purposes. We have adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties for direct marketing purposes and thus fall within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the section of this Policy entitled “Choice and Opt-Out”
