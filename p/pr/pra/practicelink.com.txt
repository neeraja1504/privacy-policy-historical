Privacy Policy
Introduction
It is essential that all users of PracticeLink understand how our services work.  Together, our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use agreement do just that. Whether you are one of our Candidates or our Employers seeking new recruits, these are important documents because they affect your rights and responsibilities.  Our Privacy Policy explains, in plain English, what information we collect on our Website, how we use that information, and how we protect it.
Two important things to note at the outset:
This Privacy Policy applies to both Candidates and Employers. Where a portion of the privacy policy applies only to one or the other, but not both, we have clearly noted the difference.
As with our Terms of Use, which directly incorporates this Privacy Policy, you must agree to our entire Privacy Policy in order to use the PracticeLink Website and Services. If you do not agree to any portion of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please stop using our Website and Services immediately. By registering with PracticeLink or using our Services, you are consenting to our practices, as described in this Privacy Policy, regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.  You are also agreeing to comply with the requirements contained herein.
In this Privacy Policy, we tell you about:

PracticeLink does not collect Personal Information while you are browsing anonymously. However, PracticeLink may automatically record certain information sent from a Non-Registered User’s browser, including the IP address from which you access our Website. For more information about our collection of Website access information, please see the section below titled “Log Information.”
In addition, online advertising and marketing networks with whom we partner may place anonymous Cookies (or similar technology) on a Non-Registered User’s device to deliver advertising and marketing materials tailored to your preferences or interests based on your online activities.

Security, Technology, and Amendments to Policies
Security
In accordance with industry standards, we have implemented security safeguards to protect PracticeLink and its users against unauthorized accessing, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information. Some of the safeguards may include:

Restricting access to Personal Information to certain PracticeLink employees, contactors, agents, and operators; and
Requiring PracticeLink employees, contactors, agents, and operators to agree to and comply with strict confidentiality agreements, the violation of which include discipline, termination, and criminal prosecution.
While we are always looking to take reasonable steps to improve our security, the Internet can never be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to PracticeLink. In particular, emails, messages, and other communications between PracticeLink users are not encrypted, and you should never use these communication methods to convey personal information that you wish to keep private. Ultimately, you are responsible for protecting the security of your password and login information.
Data Breach
While PracticeLink employs multiple security measures to maintain data security, data breaches can occasionally happen, even to the most secure of systems.  In the event of such a situation, PracticeLink will, in compliance with any applicable federal and state data breach laws, endeavor to timely notify all users whose Personal Information PracticeLink knows or has clear reason to believe was accessed by an unauthorized person.

By using PracticeLink and providing any Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of data from your country to a country that may have different privacy laws.  For citizens of the United States, your data may leave the territorial boundaries of the USA.
