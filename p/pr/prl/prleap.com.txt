Information Collected Upon Registration.
If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to PRLeap. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.
