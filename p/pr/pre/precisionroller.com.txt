Security & Privacy Policies
Security and privacy go hand-in-hand. A company that provides strong security doesn't protect you well if they share your information freely, and a company that respects your privacy can't protect it without strong security. We work to provide strong security while moving and storing information you entrust to us, and show our respect to you by keeping that information private. Here, we will detail what information we store and what we do to protect it, as well as the limited sharing we do.
Security
Your information needs to be protected both in transit (moving across networks) and when at rest (stored).
To protect data moving between you and us or between our servers, we use 2048-bit encryption with Symantec's Class 3 Extended Validation SSL Certificate (read more on Symantec's site). This certificate is not only one of the strongest available for encryption, qualifying for it required us to complete Symantec's strict business authentication process.
When storing and processing data, we add additional encryption processes for sensitive information. Our backups add further encryption, and your information is never backed up to cloud services to minimize risks of compromise.
Data encryption is only part of the answer to protecting your information, though. The other critical part of information security is making sure the software that handles that data is protected from compromise. We have strict internal security policies and practices when developing our software. All code goes through a review process before being placed in use, access to code is strictly limited, all software patches are kept up-to-date and our website is scanned daily by two separate vulnerability scan services.
Privacy
Privacy is the other important piece of information security. We appreciate your trust, and will honor the trust you place in us by strictly limiting how we share your information. Please read our FAQs below for a detailed discussion.

What does McAfee Secure seal mean to you?
| This site is tested and certified daily to pass the "McAfee Secure" Security Scan. To help address concerns about possible hacker access to your confidential data, and the safety of visiting this site, the "live" McAfee Secure mark appears only when this site passes the daily McAfee Secure tests. McAfee Secure sites are tested daily for more than 15,000 vulnerabilities.

How McAfee Secure Scan Works
McAfee Secure certification is achieved by passing rigorous daily network security audits. The certification process is completed in six steps. The first three steps are the vulnerability audit itself; comprised of Dynamic Port Scanning, Port-level Network Services Vulnerability Testing, and Web Application Vulnerability Testing. The fourth and fifth steps are alerts whenever vulnerabilities are detected and remediation management using our extensive vulnerability management portal. The result is highly effective, pro-active security.
Step 1 - Port discovery scan
Step 2 - Network services vulnerability scan
Step 3 - Web application scan
Step 4 - Alerting
Step 5 - Analysis and remediation
Step 6 - McAfee Secure certification
How is the BBBOnLine Accredited Businesses important to me?
| When you are ready to make a purchase, you want to know that the company you will be doing business with is reputable. The Better Business Bureau has been helping consumers find reputable companies since 1912.
As a member of the Better Business Bureau and BBBOnLine, we have made a commitment to the high levels of ethical business practices and customer satisfaction that the BBB expects in a reputable business. We have a satisfactory record with the Better Business Bureau and we are committed to upholding the Bureau's policies regarding any possible customer concerns that might arise.
BBB Accredited Businesses are businesses and firms which meet tough BBB Accredited Business standards, agree to follow the highest principles of business ethics and voluntary self-regulation, and have accepted an invitation from us to join.
BBB Accredited Businesses are subject to the same scrutiny we give all businesses. Staunchly neutral, we provide reports on a business' general background and consumer complaint history, if any. These reports cover accredited and non-accredited businesses alike.
As a rule, a BBB Accredited Business report will contain:
General Background: Information about the length of time a business has been in business and known to the BBB;
Complaint History: A summary of the business' complaint history and other experience in the marketplace; and/or
Pertinent Information: Information developed through special BBB investigations and relevant government actions.
The Better Business Bureau name is almost universally recognized by online users. Just under 90% of online shoppers say they would feel more confident buying from a site displaying the BBBOnLine Accredited Businesses seal, than from one that does not. The BBBOnLine Accredited Businesses seal is backed by the credibility of the Better Business Bureau system, which brings over 90 years of trust to the newest marketplace — the Internet.

What do I gain from a Safe Shopping Network site?
| People are simply tired of searching the web only to find thousands of irrelevant and often absurd web sites. The SSN is a guide to the tested best shopping websites in the world. High quality web sites earn high scores because they are owned by business people who care about quality. The web sites listed in the Safe Shopping Network have been tested by SSN to help you decide which ones you should shop at. You can see each web site's scores by looking at the bars on the right side of each web site listing. Higher bars mean higher scores and higher scores mean these merchants are working hard to earn your trust. SSN takes the trouble to test and score each web site for you. This provides you with objective information from an objective source: Safe Shopping Network.

What are SSN Safety Ratings?
| Safety ratings indicate how safe it is to shop at a particular website. High quality web sites earn high scores because they are owned by business people who care about quality. Higher bars mean higher scores and higher scores mean these merchants are working hard to earn your trust.
You can see Precision Roller's web site scores to the left.
