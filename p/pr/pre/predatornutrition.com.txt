What personal data we collect and how we use it
When you place an order with us , we collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number and payment details. We need this information to process your order and keep you updated about the progress of it.
We also keep a record of your purchase history, which allows us to improve our products and services and personalise any promotional content, should you opt into receiving it.
We don’t store your card information - it is collected by our third-party payment processors, who specialise in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions.
When you register for an account , we keep a record of your name, your email address and your password, so we can help you log into your account later, if you ever forget your credentials. Having your date of birth would help us improve your shopping experience but this field is fully optional.
Marketing
When you agree to receiving marketing from us using a sign-up page or checking the “Email” or “SMS” box, we will save your contact details (email address and / or phone number) together with your communication preferences and only send you marketing via your chosen channel – email and / or SMS.
