Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.
We strive to provide an environment in which our employees, customers, stockholders, partners and you trust us to handle personal information responsibly. We provide this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to privacy by describing what personal information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and with whom we share it.
Scope of This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors to our corporate website and affiliated websites sponsored by the Corporation. It may also apply to interactions that we have with you where we may collect your personal information, for example, where we collect information from our customers or service providers in order to operate our business.
Some of our websites, such as the LMPeople and Employee Service Center websites that provide employees and retirees access to personnel and benefits information from the Internet, may provide more detailed privacy or disclaimer notices or policies, in which case they take priority over this notice. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available in the footer of every web page where it applies. Employees and others with access to the Lockheed Martin internal Intranet should note that this privacy notice will apply if linked directly from there; otherwise, our internal privacy policies will apply as defined in Corporate Command Media.
