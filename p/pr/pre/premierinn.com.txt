We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information from trusted third parties (including travel agencies, distributors and list rental companies) for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
Where you book accommodation for other people, we may ask you to provide the above information about them (e.g. we will usually ask for the title, first name and surname, e-mail address and nationality of a person for each room that you book for identification purposes). You should only provide us with information about other people if you have their permission to do so.
We may use your information for the following purposes:
Administration and management of room and restaurant bookings and our hotels and restaurants;
Processing transactions;
Administration of our Digital Channels, including in respect of our registered users, who may also store a personal identification number online to easily access and apply room preferences and personal details when booking through our automated telephone service;
Administration and management of our competitions, promotions and prize draws – you should check the applicable terms and conditions of the competition, promotion or prize draw for further information;
Sending you communications about our products and services that we think may be of interest to you. We may also send you service information communications (e.g. reservation/booking confirmation). With your permission, we and other companies in the Whitbread group (see further information) will keep you informed of news and offers from other Whitbread group companies;
Business, website and consumer analysis and reporting; and
Correspondence between us, including where you use our 'Contact us' form.
3. Sharing your personal information with third parties
We may disclose your personal information to (in so far this is in line with applicable local data protection laws):
Other companies in the Whitbread group (see further information) and to service providers for the purposes outlined above;
A buyer in the event that we or any of our assets are acquired by a third party (as your information may be one of the transferring assets); and/or
Any third party where we are under a legal duty to do so, or in order to enforce or protect any of our rights, property or safety (or those of our customers). This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Where personal information is processed on our behalf by third parties (such as for the purposes of processing your room booking), we put measures in place to keep your information secure.
Our Digital Channels contain links to other websites, mobile sites and apps. This privacy policy only applies to our channels. When you link to other websites, mobile sites or apps we are not responsible or liable for them. You should read the privacy policies for those linked sites or apps before you submit any personal information to them.
4. Cookies
Our Digital Channels use cookies, which are small text files that contain small amounts of information that a website can send to, and store on, your computer or device through your browser. Cookies may be used by us to provide you with, for example, customised information from our website to make it more user-friendly.
For further details about the cookies on our Digital Channels, please see our ‘How we use cookies’ statement.
By using our Digital Channels, you agree to our privacy and cookie policies and consent to the use of cookies and similar technologies by us and our carefully selected third party partners as described in these policies. If you do not agree to such use, please see the 'Managing your cookies' section for details on how to adjust your settings.
5. Security
Premier Inn takes the security of any personal information we hold very seriously.
Where necessary, and in common with other websites and apps, we use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to ensure that personal information provided to us is not visible to anybody else when in transit between your computer and our servers. You can tell when SSL is in use by the presence of a small "padlock" symbol in the status bar of your web browser.
In addition, our web servers are housed behind a secure firewall that prevents access to our databases by unauthorised users. All of our servers are housed in a secure environment with high levels of physical security.
However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site: any transmission is at your risk. Once we have received your information, we will handle it in accordance with our usual practices.
Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
6. International transfers
We may transfer your personal information to, and store it at, destinations outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. It may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, for the Whitbread group of companies (see further information) or our service providers. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer.
Premier Inn will take appropriate measures to ensure that, wherever it is located, your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
7. Direct marketing
We would like to keep you informed of Premier Inn news and offers by post, phone, email, text and other electronic means.
We and other companies in the Whitbread group (see further information) would also like to keep you informed of news and offers from other Whitbread brands (including hub by Premier Inn, Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Taybarns and Table Table restaurants and Costa) by post, phone, email, text and other electronic means.
If you have agreed to receive such marketing communications you may opt out or change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us. If you have registered with Premier Inn you can change your preferences in the My Premier Inn section on this site.
8. Access to and amending your personal information
We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove personal information you think is inaccurate by contacting us. If you are registered with Premier Inn you can also update your contact details and other personal information in the My Premier Inn section of this site.
