Vizibility.com - Privacy Policy
Our Commitment to Privacy
Welcome to Vizibility.com (the "Site"), a patent pending service operated by Vizibility Inc. Vizibility provides PreSearch services (our "Services") that make it easy for You to create, share and monitor personalized PreSearches for one or more search engines via our proprietary platform (the "Vizibility Platform"). The terms "Vizibility", "us", "we" or "our" refers to Vizibility Inc., the owner of the Site and Services. The term "You" or "Your" refers to the person accessing or using the Site and Services, or the company or organization on whose behalf that person accesses the Site and Services.
We have created this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of information about You. This privacy policy applies to information that You provide to us when you use our Services or the Vizibility Platform.
Below we provide you with our Privacy Policy, where we intend to be transparent about any information we collect, how we intend to use the information, and what choices you have when you register with us and use our website or Services.
Our Privacy Policy in short:
Your privacy remains under your control
We will only use personal information you provide us according to the terms of this Privacy policy
In order to use certain features of our platform, you will provide a limited amount of personal information
Unless required for delivery of the Services, we will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party without your consent or unless we are required to so by law
You can cancel your Vizibility account at any time
What information do we collect?
During use of the Services and the Vizibility Platform, we collect various types of data, usage statistics, demographic and preference information and other personal information as described below.
When registering on our website or using certain features of Vizibility, we may collect personally identifiable information about you that may include, but is not limited to your username, email address and employment history (the "Personally Identifiable Information").
In order to use the Services, we require that you provide certain Personally Identifiable Information. We may also request additional Personally Identifiable Information from time to time thereafter. Providing such additional Personally Identifiable Information is entirely optional, although some of our Services may not function without such information.
We use your Personally Identifiable Information mainly to provide the Services to you, as applicable, to track and provide analytics, and to administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you with email, newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
Additionally, we capture, store and transmit your IP address to Google and/or any other search engine requiring it, for the sole purpose of enabling the search engine to verify that the search request is valid. Once your IP address has been transmitted to Google and/or any other supported search engine, its specific use by these search engines will be governed by their own terms of service and/or privacy policies.
Vizibility SearchMe™ Button and Link Users
If you are simply using or accessing the Site or the Services by clicking on a Vizibility SearchMe button or link, we collect certain information which cannot be used to personally identify you, and which may be provided to third parties. Such non-personal data ordinarily includes non-identifiable aggregate, summary, usage data, location data, and other behavioral data and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding total users, information regarding types of Internet browsers used by users, and behavioral usage patterns. We also collect non-personal data about each user's IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our website and Services.
Log Data
"Log Data" means information sent by your browser including, but not limited to your computer's IP address, referring HTTP address, current HTTP address, time of the access and other statistics.
We also collect Log Data each time you visit third party websites that use our Services. We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non-Personally Identifiable Information to produce reports and data that are made available to Vizibility customers appropriate for their products or services. We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity.
Minors
If providing personal data, you certify that you are over the age of 13. As such, we do not collect or maintain personal data from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site or the Services are designed to attract people under 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we ever obtain knowledge that that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that customer's personal data from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and Services.
Cookies

We also use cookies when you visit the Site and Services to collect Log Data, as described in the Log Data section above. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting browser cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.
