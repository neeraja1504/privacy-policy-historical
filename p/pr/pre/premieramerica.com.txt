PRIVACY POLICY
Effective January 1, 2014
We have developed the following Privacy Policy to address our collection and disclosure of confidential or personally
identifiable information. This policy applies to all persons and/or businesses who visit our websites as well as those
who do business with us. Premier America Credit Union (and DBA TOP Premium Finance) are committed to
protecting the privacy of our members, customers and website visitors. References to "we," "us," and "our" refer to
Premier America Credit Union. References to "you," "your" and "yours" shall mean the members, customers and
website visitors.
What You Can Do to Help Protect Your Information - We are committed to protecting your privacy. We suggest you
follow these guidelines:
     Protect your account numbers, card numbers, personal identification numbers (PINs), and Passwords. Never
keep your PIN with your debit or credit card which would provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost
or stolen.
     Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc., to other persons. If someone
calls you, explains the call is on behalf of Premier America Credit Union and asks for your account number, you
should beware. Official staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
     It is important that we have your current information so we may reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or
unauthorized activity or use of any account, we will attempt to contact you immediately. If your address, phone
number or email changes, please let us know.
Your Online Privacy
Links to Non-Premier America Websites- Premier America Credit Union offers links to other websites. Such sites
are not within our control and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility standards as ours. We
neither endorse nor guarantee, nor are we responsible for the security, content or availability of their sites. You are
encouraged to review the privacy policies of third parties before providing information on their sites.
Information We Gather Online- You may visit our website to find out about products and services and check rates,
without giving us any personally identifiable information. Our website, internet and mobile banking sites do not honor
the Do Not Track settings available in major internet browsers. We may use software tools and/or "cookies" to track
and gather information about your browsing activities in order to analyze usage, target areas for improvement, and
create marketing programs to benefit our members or potential members. Tracking includes the date and time of
visits, pages viewed, time spent on our site, browser types, Internet service provider, and the site visited just before
and just after our site. We may also track browsing activities of members who have accounts with Premier America
Credit Union and who use online Online Banking services. As part of our security procedures for members using our
Online Banking to conduct account inquiries and transactions, we require personally identifiable information such as a
login identification (login ID) and password. We consider your login in to be your consent to track your activity in order
to provide you with your banking information. We may use a cookie to authenticate your request.
About Cookies -
Cookies are small text files on your system, used to keep track of settings or data for a particular site. Web sites can
use cookies to identify a returning user or to pass information between web pages in a single visit. There are two
types of cookies: temporary and permanent. Temporary cookies are deleted once the browser is shut down.
Permanent cookies are stored on your system and can be accessed again for multiple visits. Permanent cookies
usually have an expiration date and will be automatically deleted from your system at that time. Our online Online
Banking service (OB) never passes personally identifiable information through cookies. Online OB also uses a
temporary session cookie, a non-persistent cookie, or a pre-expired cookie. This cookie is used as part of stringent
online security measures to make sure that each is not cached or saved on your computer (each page must be
retrieved from the web server). This cookie is deleted when a user logs or times out of OB or if the browser window is
closed and ensures that another user on the same computer cannot access the previous user's session or
information. If you use Enhanced Login Security, then OB may place a secure permanent cookie on your computer.
This secure cookie is unique, and when used in combination with your login information, creates a unique way to
identify you to the system. For every login attempt after you add extra security to a computer, this secure cookie is
validated along with the login identification you normally enter. This secure cookie is only used to validate your
identity and does not contain any personal information. Mobile Online Banking and Bill Pay services may use
permanent cookies to speedup identification of device type. This cookie does not contain any personal information.
IP Addresses - If you log on to OB, you pass through a "firewall" used for security purposes and the Internet Protocol
(IP) address associated with the computer you are using may be identified. The IP address does not identify you
personally. In certain instances, it may also obtain other information about your computer to better identify you as an
online user. This information may be retained in case it is needed for security or protection of member information.
How You Can Manage Your Information Online - If you are an OB user, you may access information and update
some of your personal information quickly and easily online (e.g. change or reset your PIN, Password, phone number
or postal address, including email address(es). Service Providers on the Internet - Occasionally you will notice on our
website that services are "Powered by" or "Provided by" content providers or technology service partners. We
contract with these vendors to help serve you better. We are highly selective in choosing these companies, and they
are only allowed to use member information for the purpose of providing the services contracted.
Co-branded and Alliance Relationships - We have established relationships with other parties on the Internet.
These other companies are accessed either through the use of, or by offering "co-branded" sites in which both
Premier America Credit Union and the other company share the same URL, domain name or pages within a domain
name on the Internet and the names or logos of both companies are displayed. Generally, we do not own the co-
branded sites and therefore do not control how those companies use any information supplied to them. It's important
that you review their privacy policy to understand how they manage any information you supply them. However, if you
are providing us with information, we will always adhere to our Privacy Policy
Online Applications and Forms - To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security.
All information sent using an online application or form is encrypted using security certificates issued by VeriSign.
You may communicate with us using secure email forms on the website or within Online Banking.
Email to Premier America Credit Union- If you send an email outside of the website or Online Banking, that email
is not necessarily secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, we ask that you not send
confidential account information through regular email. We will not transmit, through regular email, sensitive or
personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy. When you send an email, your email address
will be used to reply, and for a limited time your email address, your message, and response for quality assurance
purposes may be stored. This may also be done to meet legal and regulatory requirements. If your email address is
collected in this manner, it will not be used to notify you about our products and services unless you have provided
prior permission.
Email from Premier America Credit Union and Your Preferences - Email is sometimes used to inform members
about products, services or product enhancements that may be of interest if you have provided permission. When
you provide your email address online you will have an opportunity to tell us if you do not wish to receive these
messages. You will also have the opportunity to opt out of future messages on each marketing email you receive.
There are some types of email, such as eStatement notifications and important disclosures where opting-out is not
available.
Email from Other Sources We take your email marketing preference seriously and will not send marketing
messages if you tell us you do not want to receive them. Additionally, we will send you email servicing messages only
when necessary or at your initiation to quickly deliver important product enrollment, account or service information
potentially requiring action on your part. Rest assured, when you receive such messages, they will be clearly marked
as coming from us and will not request confidential information.

your Internet Service Provider for support in blocking emails or subscribing to a spam filter.
Account Aggregators - Many companies offer account aggregation services that collect information from your
accounts and consolidate into one site. In order for this to happen, you have to provide the company with sensitive
account information, personal identifiers and an access code, Password or PIN. By giving up your Password or PIN,
you are authorizing that company to access your account. All transactions conducted by the account aggregator
using an access code you provide to them are considered authorized by you.

about your Payees and Billers including addresses and any corresponding account numbers. The Bill Pay service
uses this information to send payments on your behalf to your Payees and Billers for further processing.

that you will need to provide routing and account information of your external financial institutions and investment
brokers. The Funds Transfer service uses this information to send money between your Premier America Credit
Union accounts and your accounts held at other financial institutions or investment brokers. For the Popmoney
service, you may need to provide routing or account information, email addresses or phone numbers of your
contacts. The Popmoney service uses this information to send money on your behalf to your contacts for further
processing.

aware that FinanceWorks includes retrieval and aggregation of outside account information using credentials
provided by you. The product will obtain the account information using your login ID and password for each outside

management.

card transaction activity. The product will obtain the merchant names and products purchased via debit card in order

product from the same, different or similar type of merchant. You may opt-out of Purchase Rewards. To Opt-out from
