6. OTHER WEBSITES OR SERVICES
The Platforms may have links to third-party websites, apps, or services, which may have privacy
policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties.
Any personal information submitted directly to an independent payment transaction provider for
purchase of goods, services and events on our Platforms is governed by the payment provider’s
terms of service and privacy policy. Visitors should consult all third party website privacy
policies as Beasley has no control or responsibility over information that is submitted to, or
collected by these third parties.
7. NOTE FOR PARENTS
Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Platforms to, nor do we
knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of 13. If we learn that a
child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us online, we will use reasonable
efforts to remove such information from our files, unless retaining such information is required
by statute, rule or regulation. For example, we are required by the Federal Communications
Commission to retain any correspondence received from a listener related to our programming
and operations in a public inspection file, and that would include correspondence from a child.
8. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.
Although we take appropriate and reasonable measures to help protect against the loss, misuse,
unauthorized disclosure, or alteration of your information, we cannot guarantee the security of
any information you transmit to us. If we collect sensitive personal information such as credit
card data, we will do so via a secured transmission standard or protocol, or engage a third party
to do so. Despite our best efforts, no security measures are impenetrable, and transmissions or
transactions over the Internet are not 100% secure or error free. You use the Platforms and
provide us with your information at your own risk.
DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFER
Your personal information may be stored and processed on servers in the United States and is
subject to the laws of the United States. The servers and databases in which information may be
stored may be located outside the country from which you accessed the Platforms and in a
country where the data protection and other laws may differ from your country of residence.
Your personal information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from
government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate.
Our operations are conducted, in whole or in part, in the United States. Regardless of where you
live, you consent to have your personal data transferred, processed and stored in the United
States, and allow us to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove information on the
Platforms and/or this Privacy Policy, at any time without prior notice to you. Any changes will
be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Platforms and we
encourage you to check back from time to time. If we change the Privacy Policy in a material
way, we will provide appropriate notice to you.
