What personal information do we collect and why?
We may collect personal information from you (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address etc) when you complete registration or enquiry forms or send emails to us, so that we may provide you with the services and information which you request. Please do not submit your personal information to us if you do not wish us to collect it.
If you login or subscribe to any PA Group service or product, we will use your personal information to provide you with the service or product you select, (e.g. sending you password reminders or notices about the relevant service or product being suspended for emergency or routine maintenance).
If you purchase services and products from us we may also need your name, address and payment information in order to process your transaction.
We may collect information if you choose to post information to the Site in the form of comments or contributions to discussions. In addition, we may collect information from you, for example, in order to reply to any enquiry you make of any PA Group company or notify you of a change to our service. We may also use the information you provide for our own internal statistical purposes.
You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.
Use of your personal information for marketing purposes
We may, with your agreement, give your personal information to other companies within the PA Group, for the purposes of providing products and services you have requested from us and so that those group companies can provide you with information relating to products and services we think may interest you, by letter, email or on your mobile device.

notifying your usual PA Group contact;      or

We will not disclose any personal information you provide to us to any third party organisation outside the PA Group of companies, unless:
we need to do so to provide you with the      products or services you select, for example where we use service      providers to provide certain services in support of the Site;
we are obliged or permitted by law to      disclose it (for example if required by law or a court order );
we sell or buy or reorganise any business      or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the      reorganised entity or the prospective seller or buyer of such business or      assets;
a PA Group company or substantially all      of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data      held by it may be one of the transferred assets;
to protect the rights, property, or      safety of any PA Group company, its customers, employees, or others. This      includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for      the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; or
the information is only in the form of      aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site in order to describe our      services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other      reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes and which contain no      personally identifiable information.
