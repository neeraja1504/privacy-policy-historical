• To provide personalised communications.
• Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service. For example, if you view the sports page, especially football news, first thing each day, we can present this information when you first log in. If you have selected personalised emails through your DCT account (DCT Passport) you will receive specific email content, for example our business newsletter. You can opt out of any email services at any time by logging into your passport account or clicking unsubscribe on any received emails.

What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?
There are a number of ground we process your data under. These are
• Contractual – we need the information to preform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.
• Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a product e.g. a product recall.
• Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in DC Thomson interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals. This may include the notification of lapsed subscriptions.

DCT Passport and other DCT online accounts
DCT Passport is an account management service for the DCT media online brands. This allows you to manage personal information, email subscription/preferences and access Pagesuite paid for content. It currently covers the newspapers and mature magazine titles, our travel sites and the online shops.
Other online accounts that are for a single brand (not part of the DCT passport) will only allow you to impact your interactions with that one brand.
Internal Sharing
As a Beano enthusiast you may have signed up for a Beano comic subscription or to the Beano website or both. The comic is produced by DC Thomson media (our publishing arm) and the website along with other online and offline activities are run by the DC Thomson company known as Beano Studios. To provide you with a seamless experience it may be necessary to share your personal information between these two organisations. We will only share the information needed to provide you with the services you are using and will not routinely share all the data we hold on you.

We may from time to time provide your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing you with competition prizes or our goods and services. These third party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, credit referencing providers, third party sales processor (includes fulfilment services) and service providers who assist us with hosting our marketing campaigns. They do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times.
When transferring any personal information outwith the EEA we only do so under one of the legally recognised transfer mechanisms for ensuring the data is safeguarded. These are:
• The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding.
• The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.
• Binding corporate rules – this is where a large company’s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed-off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data.
• If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
• Appropriate certification schemes
We will not provide your data to other third parties for marketing purposes unless you have specifically consented to this when you first provided your data to us. You are entitled to withhold this consent and opt out from receiving such third party communications at any time by not giving your consent on the form (paper or web) that collects your details or telling the operator when you call. You can also update these options by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, contacting us by email at privacy@dcthomson.co.uk or by post to Information Security Manager, D C Thomson & Co Ltd., Courier Buildings, Albert Square, Dundee DD1 9QJ.
