At some of our sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.  Please click here to view our Terms and Conditions, including information regarding your use of these features.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.
You may be required to provide us with the requested personally identifiable information to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.
How We Use Personally Identifiable Information
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may share your information with our affiliated companies.
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
The information we may collect in connection with online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience.  We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
Mailing Lists
We may launch a mailing list for some or all of the Services and websites, in order to provide subscribers with relevant information: breaking news, or weekly or daily round-ups, for example. In order to sign up to receive regular e-newsletters from a site's mailing list, users must submit information including a valid e-mail address and demographic information such as location and interests. Demographic information will be used in aggregate form only in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services.
Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list will receive regular e-mails from the site. Most of the time, these will be content from the site in question, but we may periodically send out an e-mail from a third party sponsor. Such e-mails do not represent an endorsement by Diamond of any products, services or information advertised therein. Such e-mails will clearly be marked as advertising: please check it out, as we hope you will feel that it is relevant to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails from third party advertisers, please do not sign up for the mailing list.
Discussion Group and Cookies
In order to further enhance the user experience; Diamond runs a commenting service on some or all of the Diamond Sites where users can discuss common topics of interest. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must submit information including a valid e-mail address. Diamond uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use and to pick out topics of interest to discussion board users Diamond will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form.
Some services Diamond offers may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
