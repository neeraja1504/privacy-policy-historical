PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: November 21, 2012.
Welcome to Preply!
This Privacy Policy discloses FindGuru, Inc.’s (“Preply”, “we”, “us” or “our”) privacy practices and
procedures in connection with Preply’s website located at www.preply.com and all related sub-domains,
tools and services (the “Website”). This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by or in
connection with this Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Preply does
not administer, or to individuals that Preply does not employ. We may update this Privacy Policy at any
time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website at www.preply.com. Your access and use of the
Website, including all services available therein, is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate
Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning
assigned to them in the Terms of Service.
Preply is an online auction-based e-marketplace for connecting Users seeking tutoring services and
materials (“Students”) and Users who provide tutoring services and materials (“Tutors”). The Services
provide connections to Tutors who are willing to be engaged by Students and Parents as independent
contractors. As independent contractors, the listed Tutors control the methods, materials and all aspects of
the lessons. The Services allow Tutors to create subject-specific tutoring packages for certain number of
hours that may occur over a number of tutoring sessions (each session individually a “Tutor Session,”
collectively the “Tutor Package”). A Tutor may submit a Tutor Package for posting on the Services by
submitting a listing (“Listing”) consistent with the policies set forth by Preply on the Website from time
to time. The Tutor Packages may include written materials or other learning media (“Tutor Materials”)
as provided by a Tutor to assist Students in the Tutor Sessions. Upon a Tutor’s Listing being posted on
our Services, such Listing will be open to bids from Students and Parents during a set period of time (the
“Bidding Window”). Students and Parents may search and bid on Tutor Packages as offered by Tutors by
entering certain parameters to search the available Tutor Packages.
