Doerr Consulting is the legal owner of StorkNet and is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information in ways that are not disclosed in this statement without your consent. Any breach of this policy by our staff will result in immediate dismissal.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, monitor site usage and help us collect broad demographic information. Such statistics help us identify popular areas so we can improve the visitor experience.
Cookies
The StorkNet message boards (at StorkNotes.com) use cookies so you don't have to re-enter your user name and password each time you visit the boards. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies are not executable pieces of code and cannot do anything to your hard drive. They are merely pieces of "text" stored on your computer. They are easy to delete from your hard drive (and it's not a bad idea to do this once in awhile).
Advertisers
We use outside advertising companues to display some of the ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies on our message boards, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad agencies, and we do not have access to this information. These companies may use information ( not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Message Board Registration
Our Message Boards require registration to post, and the registration form requires users to give us their name and email. Users have the option to make their email address private or public. If a user opts to make their email public, StorkNet is not responsible for any spam or other email received from visitors to our message boards. Our message board software gives users the ability to "opt-out" of administrative mailings regarding the message board.
Public Forums
StorkNet makes message board forums available to its users. Please be aware that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and care should be exercised when deciding to disclose personal information. StorkNet cannot be responsible for the information users post in these public areas including other websites.
Surveys and Contests
From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. This information is not shared with any third party. Survey information is used for purposes of monitoring or improving use and satisfaction of StorkNet and your name is not required.
External Links
This site contains links to other sites. StorkNet is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. When you click on a link that takes you off a StorkNet site, this Privacy Policy no longer applies including e-commerce sites listed in the StorkNet Mall.
Newsletters
If you subscribe to our Before Birth and Beyond newsletter, you will not receive separate email from other companies as a result of subscribing to our newsletter. Subscribed addresses are not shared or sold with other companies. If you decide to unsubscribe, you may do so via the link provided in the newsletter or going to http://www.storknet.com/newsletter.
Send This Page to a Friend Feature
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, the user is asked for the friend's name and email address. StorkNet automatically sends the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. This information is not stored and the friend will never receive another email from StorkNet as a result of this service.
