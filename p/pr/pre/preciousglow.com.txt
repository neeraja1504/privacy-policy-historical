Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. Accordingly, the first thing you should know is that we are Ideal Diamond Solutions, Inc.,(“IDS”) and we operate this website under license from Preciousglow.com (“Retailer”).

We operate a separate website for actual processing of orders (“Order Processing Website”).

We may update this privacy statement periodically to reflect company and customer comments and input. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
