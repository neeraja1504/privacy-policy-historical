ProfitWell
Our lawyers made the below nice and legal (because that's their job). They did let us put together this summary though, which let's us boil down everything you're about to read in a nice, easy to understand context. Do your dilligence on the below though (that's your job). If anything doesn't make sense or you'd like to put together custom terms, email us at product@profitwell.com.. For most companies we're happy to oblige to fulfill your security, compliance, and privacy requirements.
We do not and will not sell your data
To be crystal clear - ProfitWell does not and will not ever sell your data to third parties. Your data is your data. Further, your data is rarely accessed with the only reasons we'd ever look at your data is if there's a QA or security issue, or if you give us permission for the purposes of analysis and helping you with identifying problems/opportunities in your business.
We do study data in aggregate to improve our products, security, and knowledge of the market to help you. If you'd like to opt out of this, you can through signing a custom Terms of Use with us. Just email product@profitwell.com. to get the ball rolling.
How do we make money then? Well, we do this by showing you problems and opportunities in your business through the free metrics and then sell you tools to solve those problems automatically for you. We think that's just a better way of doing business, because selling you graphs (although they're beautiful and insightful) just doesn't feel right.
What about GDPR and EU data protection?
We have you all taken care of on the GDPR front. You can check out more information our GDPR practices on our GDPR and EU specific page, but you can also sign our Data Processing Addendum here. We're also fully certified under the US-EU and US-Swiss Privacy Shield, which you can learn more about below.
How's ProfitWell's security?
When it comes to security we do a lot , from CCTV and personnel trainings to penetration testing and network defenses this is an area that's extremely important to our continued success. There's a full write up here on our security page, but if you'd like our full security risk assessment, send us an email at product@profitwell.com.
