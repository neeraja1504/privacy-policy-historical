Priacta may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age or gender. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future. If you contact us outside of the website (e.g., by phone or email) we will, of course, gather personal and confidential information for use in assessing and advising you and your company.

Priacta collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s), to deliver the information, consultation, coaching, training, and other services you have requested ("Services"), and may use it to customize your experience on the website(s) by presenting the most pertinent information for your needs and interests. Priacta also collects and uses aggregated or NON-personally-identifiable information in the form of aggregated, generalized or anonymized experiences, insights, survey results and situations to improve its expertise and ability to assist all of its clients, to create case studies, and to teach and train.
If you opt in and have not since opted out to a specific mailing list, Priacta may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the specific information you requested or information directly related to it, possibly including products and services from Priacta and its affiliates, and Priacta may also contact you via surveys (which you may similarly opt out of) to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
Priacta may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Priacta.com and its affiliated websites in order to determine what Priacta services are the most popular.

Priacta is a consulting firm that gathers and draws on a wide range of experiences with many firms and individuals worldwide. If you contact us for consulting advice, including outside the website (i.e., phone, email, in person) or use private online tools on Priacta.com, then the survey results, experiences, insights, situations, and other information you choose to share with us will be treated as confidential for the purposes of delivering the information, consultation, and other services you have requested, even if the consultation is free. However, Priacta reserves the right use aggregated, generalized or anonymized, non-personally identifiable, non-trade secret information from these discussions for purposes of studying and teaching leadership and related principles. In these cases, information will be aggregated or all identifying details randomly modified, obscured, or removed.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Priacta.com pages, or register with Priacta.com site or services, a cookie helps Priacta.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Priacta.com website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Priacta.com features that you customized.
