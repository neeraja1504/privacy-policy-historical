We save the details you provide to us in your account profile, including your email address, phone numbers, physical address – you get the idea.

We also collect the following usage statistics at an aggregate level:
- Your IP address

- Complete anonymous traffic analysis, via Google Analytics
- Provide statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data
