The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide such features.
What Analytics, Advertising and Other Third Party Services We Use
Third Party Services and User Information. We may allow third parties to serve advertisements in connection with our Services, to provide analytics services and provide you with other services, such as rewards programs and tournaments. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, Flash Cookies, your account information (that you provide to such third parties) and other technologies to collect information about you on our Services and other websites and online services, such as your internet protocol addresses, the browsers you use to visit our Services, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. These third parties may also share this information with their customers and clients. This information may be used by us, and such other companies and their customers and clients, to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interest and better understand your usage. Some of such third party analytics and advertising services may offer you a choice to opt-out of the collection and/or sharing of this information. Links to the opt-out mechanisms for the third parties that offer such a choice can be found in the following section. This Privacy Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons, Flash Cookies or other tracking technologies.
How We Keep Your Information Safe
We take commercially reasonable security measures to help protect information we collect about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. These security measures may include practices such as transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered while using our Services using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). Unfortunately, however, no security system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that the information we collect from you will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors may compromise the security of user information. Your password is an important component of our security system, and as a result it is your responsibility to protect your password. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should change your password immediately.
Where We Store Your Information
All your information that Asteri Networks collects through the Services is transferred to, and accessed from, jurisdictions, including the United States where Asteri Networks has its headquarters.
Your Consent Declaration
By  accepting this Privacy Policy, you consent to having your information transferred to, and accessed from, any location worldwide, including the United States for the purpose of providing the Services of Asteri Networks. You also consent to having your information processed and maintained in any location worldwide, including the United States for these purposes. You acknowledge that other jurisdictions may have laws that are different than the laws of your home country.
For visitors to our Services who are based within the European Union, this will involve the processing of your information outside of the European Economic Area, (the “EEA”). If you do not wish your information to leave the EEA, or your home country, please do not provide your information via the Services. If you have already provided your information, and you require us to stop processing your information, please contact us at privacy@asteri-networks.com We take the privacy of our users seriously and therefore take steps to safeguard your information, including assuring an adequate level of data protection in accordance with E.U. standards. If you provide your information you are aware that certain governmental authorities may have access to your information stored in the United States in accordance with your consent. The legal protections and other rights available to those affected in the event of such access by governmental authorities may be different compared to the protection provided in the EEA countries and may not entirely reflect standards imposed under European law. This includes the fact that governmental authorities may request access to your information without allowing Asteri Networks to inform you of such access, and that such requests for (and grants of) access may not be subject to equal limitations with regard to necessity and purpose as would be in effect under European law.  Furthermore, governmental authorities may subject your information to further processing and such further processing may not be subject to equal limitations with regard to necessity and purpose as would be in effect under European law. Finally, you are aware that governmental authorities in the United States may not be subject to the same types or degree of public control by other authorities or courts as present under European law.
Our Policies Regarding Children
As set out in our Terms of Service (available at www.asteri-networks.com/terms), you must be at least 18 years old or have the requisite power and authority to access and/or use our Services. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you must obtain the consent of your parent or legal guardian to use the Services. Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use or attempt to use our Services, and if you are under 13, please do not attempt to use our Services or send any information about yourself to Asteri Networks.
In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records. Parents who believe that we might have gathered any information from or about a child under the age of 13 may submit a request to delete such information to privacy@asteri-networks.com or write to our address listed in Section 14 (Contact Us) below.
If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information at one of our Services, we invite you to notify us so that we may delete the information from our records and discontinue any related features or services. We appreciate your cooperation in assisting us to provide a safe and enjoyable online experience for your children.

Cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
Push Notifications. We may send push notifications or “alerts” to your mobile device to provide information regarding our Services, service updates, promotional communications and other related messages. You can deactivate push notifications by changing your notification settings via your device.

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Because consumers are often unaware that their do not track beacons are active, do not track frequently does not reflect the actual preferences of our users. However, we do respond to the federal Do Not Track signal.
