PrintPlanet Privacy Policy
PrintPlanet.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy to users of www.printplanet.com, PrintPlanet discussion forum(s), and other services offered through the PrintPlanet System (the "Services"). The following discloses our information gathering, security, and dissemination practices for PrintPlanet.
Information Collected by Us
The registration process for the Services requires users to give us contact information (such as their name and e-mail address) along with other demographic information. We may also collect and archive information contained in the communications posted on or sent through the Services by you.
How We Use Your Personal Information
PrintPlanet will use your information to improve PrintPlanet's internal marketing and promotional efforts, to send you promotional material, to statistically analyze service usage and trends, to improve the content and offerings available from PrintPlanet, and to customize the Services for the purpose of better meeting users' needs. As described below, users may opt-out of receiving certain promotional materials.PrintPlanet may use your contact information in order to contact you from time to time in connection with your use of the Services. PrintPlanet may also use information collected about you to insure the integrity of the PrintPlanet System and to identify users who may be in breach of the PrintPlanet Terms of Use.
Disclosure to Third Parties
Aggregated usage and demographic information regarding users may be disclosed to third-party advertisers. In such circumstances, no information will be disclosed that could be decompiled to identify you. PrintPlanet does not intend to rent, lease, or sell any of your personally identifiable information to any third party. However, PrintPlanet may transfer such information to a third-party successor to PrintPlanet's business in connection with a merger, sale of assets, consolidation, reorganization, or other similar transaction.
PrintPlanet may disclose information about its users to third-party auditors as necessary to allow such third-party auditors to determine the accuracy of payments made to or received by our business partners. PrintPlanet may periodically employ third parties to perform various functions on its behalf. Such functions may include, for example, Web site hosting, data analysis, marketing research, customer service, and shipment of products. The third parties performing such functions will have access to your information solely as may be necessary for them to perform such functions.
PrintPlanet will disclose information about you as may be requested by law enforcement authorities, in order to protect the rights or property of PrintPlanet or when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to comply with the law or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or the violation of the Terms of Use.
Due to the evolving regulatory environment, PrintPlanet cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other sensitive information will never be disclosed in a manner not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, but not by way of limitation, PrintPlanet may be forced to disclose information about you to governmental agencies; third parties may also unlawfully access such information. While PrintPlanet employs careful security measures, you should not expect that your sensitive information or private communications will always remain private.

Security
This site uses industry-standard methods to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including, but not limited to, password authentication, protocol blocking, and authorized physical access. However, no publicly available computer system should be considered safe from intrusion and we do not guarantee that your information will never be compromised.

Printplanet Web Sites and Cookies
PrintPlanet Web sites may use "cookies" to store member names and passwords. Cookies allow us to both store and retrieve login information through a user's browser. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that we use to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can not read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use PrintPlanet at this time, but that may change without notice in the future.
