Details about our privacy policy are described below. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.
Security
Printroom utilizes technology, security features, and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of our customer information. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server and secure server software (SSL)-based encryption of all information you input.

Printroom uses cookies (small pieces of information that are stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive) to recall your email address and other information stored in your customer profile. For example, our Online Store uses cookies to remember the contents of your shopping cart as you make your selections, and to recall your billing address.

From time to time, you may have the opportunity to enter a contest or fill out a customer survey.
