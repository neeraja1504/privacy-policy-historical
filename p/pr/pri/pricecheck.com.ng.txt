You should not divulge your account password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
If you are a legal entity and not an individual, we will liaise only with your named contact or alternative contact provided by your named contact. It is your responsibility to let us know of any changes to your named contact.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS
We may share your personal information with:
Other divisions or companies within the group of companies to which we belong, being the Silvertree Internet Holdings (Pty) Ltd group of companies which includes companies registered in countries other than Nigeria so as to provide joint content and services like registration, transactions and customer support, to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will only use this information to send you marketing communications if you have requested their services.
Our Merchants, but only in the event and to the extent that you, the User, have expressly authorised such disclosure beforehand. The reason for this is that Merchants sometimes request a User's details in order to follow up with such User as to his/her grievances regarding such Merchant's product/s. Should PriceCheck receive any such request from a Merchant in relation to a User, we will notify the User thereof via email and request his/her permission to such disclosure. Please note that Merchants have their own privacy policies, and PriceCheck will not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices, once a User’s personal information has been given to them, either by us with the User’s prior authorisation in accordance with this clause, or by the User directly when transacting with such Merchants. We similarly will not be liable in any way for the manner in which a User may use or disclose any Merchant-related information provided to him/her directly by such Merchant.
Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations (fraud prevention, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this Policy, you will receive prior notice.)
Law enforcement, government officials, fraud detection agencies or other third parties when (a) we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or (b) we need to do so to comply with any law; or (c) we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement and/or Merchant Agreement.
Other third parties, with your consent or direction to do so.
PriceCheck will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this Policy.
HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You can review and edit any of your personal information at any time by signing in to your User Account or Merchant Account (as the case may be) and clicking the My Account menu in any of the PriceCheck pages.
NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Policy regarding your information, the following information is not regarded as personal information for purposes of this Policy:
1. Permanently de-identified information that does not relate and/or cannot be traced back to you specifically. We may compile, use, share and otherwise process such information as we deem fit.
2. Non-personal statistical information collected and compiled by us. We own and retain all rights in such information
3. Information which you have provided voluntarily in an open, public environment or forum including (without limitation) any blog, chat room, albums, community, classifieds or discussion board. Because the information has been disclosed in a public forum, it is no longer confidential and does not constitute personal information subject to protection under this Policy. Since such public environments are accessible by third parties, it is possible that third parties may collect and collate and use such information for their own purposes and you should accordingly be careful when deciding to share any of your personal information in such public environments
YOU CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
By accepting this Policy, you consent to our collection, storage, processing and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy. Should you terminate your registration with us and close your User Account, you consent to our retention of the information we have already collected from you for record-keeping purposes only.
