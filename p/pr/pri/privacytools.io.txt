Privacy Policy | privacytools.io
This Privacy Policy explains what information privacytoolsIO and its related entities collect about its users, what we do with that information, and how we handle the content you place in our products and services.
Scope of Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of privacytoolsIO's services via a Device or when you otherwise interact with privacytoolsIO's official web services.
privacytoolsIO services include our:
Websites (privacytools.io and subdomains *.privacytools.io)
but does not include:
Products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.
Third Party Products. These are third party products or services that you may discover on our website or other official services we offer. privacytoolsIO cannot guarantee your privacy outside of websites under our control. You should always review the policies of third party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, privacytoolsIO collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. privacytoolsIO's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how its visitors use its website and related services. From time to time, privacytoolsIO may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
privacytoolsIO collects anonymized IP addresses in this form: 192.xxx.xxx.xxx for self-hosted Matomo statistics software. privacytoolsIO does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Opting Out of Website Tracking
privacytoolsIO uses a self-hosted Matomo install to track visitor data. You can opt out entirely using the form below. This form may not function correctly with an ad blocker enabled.
privacytoolsIO respects your Do Not Track setting in your browser. Users with Do Not Track enabled will not be tracked by any of our platforms. You are also free to block stats.privacytools.io using whatever method you prefer with no detrimental effects on your experience using our services.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to privacytoolsIO's websites choose to interact with privacytoolsIO in ways that require privacytoolsIO to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that privacytoolsIO gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our Mastodon service to provide a username and email address. In each case, privacytoolsIO collects such information only as in necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with privacytoolsIO. privacytoolsIO does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Protection of Personally-Identifying Information
privacytoolsIO will never rent, sell, nor give away potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to any third parties.
If you are a registered user of a privacytoolsIO service such as Mastodon or PeerTube, privacytoolsIO may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with the service and the privacytoolsIO organization. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
privacytoolsIO takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Aggregated Statistics
privacytoolsIO may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites, and may reveal generalized statistics related to a variety of our services.
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. privacytoolsIO uses cookies to help privacytoolsIO track visitor statistics, a visitor's usage of the privacytoolsIO website or services, and their services preferences. privacytoolsIO visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using privacytoolsIO's websites, with the drawback that certain features of privacytoolsIO's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, privacytoolsIO may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at privacytoolsIO's sole discretion. privacytoolsIO encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
