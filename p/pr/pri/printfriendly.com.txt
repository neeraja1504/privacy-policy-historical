We use third party services to provide the following important functions.
Web analytics so we can optimize the speed and quality of the service
We monetize the free service using ads and partner with trusted ad networks. Publishers can purchase a pro subscription to remove ads ("legitimate interest").
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by PrintFriendly and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on PrintFriendly.com. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to PrintFriendly.com and other sites on the Internet.
Ad Personalization and Opt Out Information
Google and other third party ad network/exchanges personalize ads to be more relevant. You can opt out of this personalization.
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at google.com/ads/preferences/
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our sites or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at networkadvertising.org.
Protection of Personally-Identifying Information
PrintFriendly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PrintFriendly behalf or to provide services available at PrintFriendly's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PrintFriendly's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PrintFriendly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PrintFriendly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PrintFriendly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PrintFriendly, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of PrintFriendly and have supplied your email address, PrintFriendly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with PrintFriendly and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. PrintFriendly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Business Transfers
If PrintFriendly, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that PrintFriendly goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PrintFriendly may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, PrintFriendly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PrintFriendly's sole discretion. PrintFriendly encourages visitors to check this page for changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
