Welcome to Prisma (“Prisma,” “we,” “us” or “our”). Prisma provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to stylize your photo. Just snap a photo, choose a style to transform the look and feel, and share!
Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Prisma services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. We undertake to build the Service and any of its features in such a way that it respects your privacy and allow you not only to understand what we do with your personal information, but also manage your data effectively.
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to stylize content.
Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect the following types of information.
Information you provide us directly. If you are unregistered user we collect User Content (including your photos and materials with applied styles) that you post through the Service.
Analytics information. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
Cookies and similar technologies. When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Prisma and provide features to you.
We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.
Log file information. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
Device identifiers. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Prisma.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Among others we collect the following device identifiers:
User Device ID
Platform (iOS/Android)
Device OS Version
App Version
First request time

Metadata. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you share a photo) or other data.
Registered users. If you are registered user we may collect more Personal Data about you including the following:
Email/Phone number;
Username (real name is not mandatory, just nickname or username),
User DeviceID (generated by our app),
First user authorization date and time,
Shared Posts :

Post title,

Geo-location of user’s device (Lat/Long),
Date/time of posting event.
Different ID assigned to you when you use the Service (for example, comment ID, post ID, sender ID)
If the information covered by this Section is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, we may use it for any business purpose. To the extent information covered by this Section is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data.” We use pseudonymization for particular types of Personal Data to ensure better security of your Personal Data. Please bear in mind that provisions of Section 3 do not apply to pseudonymized Personal Data.
2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION AND PERSONAL DATA
In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive (including Personal Data) for the following purposes:
to provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing;

For any new purpose of processing we will ask your separate consent. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We also undertake to collect only such amount and types of Persona Data that are strictly required for the purposes mentioned in this Section of the Privacy Policy (“data minimization principle”).

Our Service Providers will be given access to your Personal Data as is reasonably and appropriately necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality and data protection terms.
We may also share certain Personal data and information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

However, Prisma cannot ensure the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Service or an absolute guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Please understand that there is no ideal technology or measure to maintain 100 % security. Among others, we utilize the following information security measures:
Pseudominization of certain categories of your Personal Data;

Systematic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing;
Organizational and legal measures.

Third party (onward) transfers and Privacy Shield compliance.  In the context of an onward transfer, we have responsibility for the processing of Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield or generally from the EU and Swiss residents and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We remain liable under the Principles and GDPR, if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles and GDPR, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For any onward transfer we commit to execute a formal agreement with any receiving party or processor acting on our behalf.
If we receive Personal Data subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
