Your privacy is important to us. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998).
We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.

The type of information we will collect about you includes:
your name

credit/debit card details
We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law and the Safebuy Code of Practice. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first.
We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser.
