PRIVACY POLICY | Prizelogic.com
Privacy Policy
Introduction & Purpose
This Privacy Policy explains how PrizeLogic handles personal information that you share with us. As explained in below, our Privacy Policy is designed to provide notice to individuals regarding how their personal information is being collected and used.
**Information Collection
A. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
In some instances, on behalf of our clients, PrizeLogic may collect PII (e.g., your name, street address, e-mail address, and telephone number). PII collected by PrizeLogic will be used in accordance with that particular client’s Privacy Policy and as set forth herein. An individual’s desire to “opt-out” of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with that particular client’s Privacy Policy.
B. Personal information that is not PII.
On behalf of our clients, PrizeLogic may also collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, “cookies,” and Internet tags and navigational data). “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer’s hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you will find them on most major web sites. PrizeLogic may place and store Internet cookies on a user’s hard drive. The use of cookies provide benefits to you by saving user names, information that are supplied at registration, and other information that may make the use of our promotions easier. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas on a web site may not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.
C. Mobile Devices
PrizeLogic also operates mobile programs on behalf of its clients. We may receive information about your location, your mobile device or any PII submitted in the course of such programs.
D. PrizeLab Players
PrizeLogic may also collect PII and non-personally identifiable information for its own purposes, including but not limited to, PrizeLogic’s PrizeLab sweepstakes. By entering a PrizeLogic sponsored promotion, entrant expressly consents to the Sponsor storing and using the information submitted with his/her entry for the purpose of administering the Sweepstakes and/or providing and personalizing the below noted communications and for other purposes which may include, but are not limited to, sharing your information with third parties. Information may be transferred and stored for these purposes in jurisdictions outside of Canada, including the United States. Sponsor uses the personally identifiable information collected in this Sweepstakes as sales leads and may contact the individual registrants by email, mail, phone, or other contact information provided when entering the Sweepstakes. By participating in the Sweepstakes, entrant hereby agrees to receive email and other notices from Sponsor, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other promotions. Such notices may come from Sponsor itself or from Sponsor on behalf of companies with whom Sponsor has a business relationship. If you want to “opt-out” of being contacted by Sponsor after you have participated in one of its promotions, you may do so by sending an email to privacy@prizelogic.com. Please make sure to include the name of the Sweepstakes in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.
Security, Sharing, Retention, and Storage of Personal Identifiable Information.
Although “guaranteed security” does not exist either on or off the Internet, PrizeLogic endeavors to protect your personal information using physical, electronic, and procedural security measures. These measures include safeguards to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use and modification. PrizeLogic makes commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with its Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations. PrizeLogic may share PII third parties for legitimate business purposes. PrizeLogic stores PII in a secure environment behind its “firewall.” PrizeLogic employees whose job responsibilities require them to use PII are permitted access to such data and are required to sign confidentiality agreements prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of PII. PrizeLogic’s information practices may change occasionally. If material changes to such practices are made, we will update this Privacy Policy on our website.
Special Note about Children
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, PrizeLogic promotions are not available to anyone under the age of thirteen (13). PrizeLogic does, however, operate some promotions on behalf of its clients that collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In each such instance, PrizeLogic complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) when operating the promotion, collecting the information itself, and subsequently using the data collected. PII will not be collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent in compliance with the COPPA guidelines.
California Privacy Rights
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1789.83, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. See paragraph 7 below for PrizeLogic’s contact information.
Accuracy of Personally Identifiable Information.
It is PrizeLogic’s goal to keep all PII that you provide to us accurate. Upon request to PrizeLogic as set forth in paragraph 7 below, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information.
