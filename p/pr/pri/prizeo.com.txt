1. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE SERVICES
1.  _Information that We Automatically Collect:_ Like many web businesses, we use automated mechanisms such as cookies, web beacons and pixels to keep track of users' interactions with the Services. Information we collect using cookies, web beacons and pixels may include your Internet protocol address, referring website address, browser type and the times that your computer accessed the Services. We recognize that you may not be familiar with the italicized terms used in the foregoing sentence, so an explanation of each of these italicized terms is included in a **glossary** section below in this Privacy Policy. We may use data we gather automatically to help us recognize you as a previous visitor to the Site, to serve relevant online advertising to you or to analyze trends and statistics to improve your experience of the Services. You can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. You may also obtain third party software that will allow you to visit the Site without providing the information gathered by cookies. However, if you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use of cookies, some features of the Services may be unavailable or unable to function properly. In addition, if you access the Services through a mobile device, we may also be able to identify the location of your mobile device. You may choose not to share your location details with us by adjusting your mobile device's location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.
2.  _Information that third Parties Automatically Collect:_ We also use third party analytics such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze anonymous user information. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to collect information about your use of the Services. Google may use cookies to collect information about your purchase history, the content you view, what websites you visit immediately prior to and after visiting the Site, and your system information and geographic information. The information generated by the Google cookies about your use of the Services will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information collected by Google allows us to analyze your use of the Services.
3.  _Interest-Based Advertising._ The Services may also include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, may use web beacons, pixels and/or cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who click on the links made available through the Services. These third parties may collect information about you and/or your computer network over time and across different websites to provide targeted or personalized advertising (also referred to sometimes as online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising). We do not have access to or control over web beacons, pixels or cookies that these third parties may use. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites you visit.
Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their information gathering technologies. We only engage third-party advertising companies that have represented to us that they comply with the protocols of the Networking Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which give consumers choices about how their personal information is tracked and used. For more information about the opt-out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, and the DAA by visiting www.aboutads.info (DAA homepage).
