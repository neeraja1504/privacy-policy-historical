Last updated: 17 March 2014
Generally pricerunner.co.uk ("Site" or "we", "our" or "us") does not collect, store, use or disclose any data collected with an intention to identify and/or contact a person such as: name, address, telephone number or e-mail address (hereinafter "PII") except in very specific instances, for example, when you provide PII through registering on the Site or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Whenever we collect such PII, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
This service is provided by PriceRunner Ltd. For us, privacy is a top priority and we provide this Privacy Policy to outline our practices and procedures with respect to information collection and use to enable you to make an informed decision about sharing information with us.
What does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by us.
Please be aware that, as part of the service provided by this Site, we may provide links to websites operated by third parties. Note that for usability reasons PriceRunner’s header may be displayed should you click to such a third party site. We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such third-party Web sites or applications to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.
What information do we collect and how is it used? Do we disclose information to third parties?
We may collect any or all of the following three types of information: (i) traffic or clickstream data, (ii) non-personally identifiable information (for example: IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity) ("Non-PII"), and/or (iii) PII in the instances as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties or subsidiaries or affiliates of PriceRunner. PriceRunner may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and this Site or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by PriceRunner and adhere to the provisions in this privacy policy.
a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ("Clickstream Data").
Clickstream Data consists of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable. We do not supplement or combine Clickstream Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect with subsidiaries or affiliates of PriceRunner Ltd. ("PriceRunner Entities") and with certain selected third parties, but only in anonymous form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third parties or PriceRunner Entities may combine such Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or PriceRunner Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream Data regarding use of our services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) you access. For example, our servers collect information about the site to which you may redirect to in order to enable us to calculate and receive payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream Data to better design our services. Within the company and with respect to online behavioural advertising, certain affiliated companies may use non-personally identifiable information (which may or may not include click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice and/or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org.
(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages that visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes.
