This website makes use of Google Analytics, which stores data for 26 months. You can view the Google Privacy & Terms here and Compliancy Policy here.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

What data breach procedures we have in place
We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.  If we are alerted to a security breech, you will be contacted via email within 48 hours.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Industry regulatory disclosure requirements
California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.  See more here
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously.
Our privacy policy is available from our home page, as well as our about page.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
