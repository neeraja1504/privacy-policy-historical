Collection of Information
Focus on the Family does not collect personal information without your knowledge during your visit to our Web sites. However, Focus on the Family does at times ask that you provide us with personal information while online. The type of information we collect typically, but not always, corresponds directly with the service you request. For instance, you can make donations, when requested you can offer your thoughts, opinions, prayers, concerns, ideas, personal experiences, questions and/or suggestions to our resources, contests, or radio broadcasts, or you can request that a resource be sent to you directly from our Online Resource Center. As a visitor, the personal information you provide may also be used to improve the usability of, and information available on, our sites. In other words, at times we will ask you for more information, beyond just your name and contact information, than is needed to facilitate our response to your specific request. Your provision of such additional information is your acknowledgement that you consent to our use of such information to better serve you, our visitor, and others coming to our sites. We also have a Privacy Policy for Children that parents may be interested in reviewing.
Focus on the Family does not sell, lease or rent your confidential information. However, we may need to disclose personal information as required by law, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request, to enforce our Terms of Service, or site rules; or to protect the safety and security of our visitors and our sites.
