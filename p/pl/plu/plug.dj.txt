Last Updated: April 17, 2014
1. Introduction
plug.dj respects your privacy and the security of your personal information, and we want to do as much as we can to protect it. Because of this, we have created this Privacy Policy to govern how we deal with your personal information. Since our Site is built off of Content that you provide, including shared information from third party sites, it is important that you read and understand their information sharing policies as well. Please check back often, as we will update this Privacy Policy as we grow.
2. Personal Information We Collect
In order for you to sign up for our service, we may ask for personal information from you including your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, photo, username from other social media sites, gender, date of birth, or other relevant information. In addition, we utilize third party API’s like Facebook Connect, Twitter OAuth, and other API’s that allow you to transfer your profile information from those Sites to ours depending on your settings on those Sites. We are not responsible for any information that does not transfer or if any information is inaccurate.
Your use of any of the video or chat features may be recorded or logged by our servers. We may use this data to improve our Site or Platform, or to determine how best to provide marketing opportunities to you.
We use the above referenced information to contact you regarding your account, assist in customer service and support, and to improve our Site and the plug.dj platform. We also use the information we collect to send periodic communications to you regarding updates to our Site, new features, and marketing opportunities that we think you may find interesting.
We may send you periodic emails that concern updates or features. Nobody likes spam, so we make sure to comply with CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 15 U.S.C. 7701 whenever we send you these goodies. If you feel that you are receiving unwanted messages from us (which we hope isn’t the case!) then please use the unsubscribe button or email us at support@plug.dj to remove yourself from our list. Please allow for up to ten (10) business days to process the removal.

We use this information to improve our Site and the plug.dj platform.
4. Cookies
We use tracking cookies to distinguish you from other users to help prevent one user from unwittingly logging into another user’s account on the same computer or network. In conjunction with third party API’s, we also allow you to login using your credentials on those third party sites.

In addition, any time you share Content with others those third party Sites may collect information about people who view or share that Content. You must also read their privacy policies.
We also may use tracking cookies to help ourselves or third party advertisers increase the effectiveness and quality of, and interest in, our marketing programs, or for other advertising or marketing purposes.

As such, you must make sure you do not post anything that you do not have the rights to distribute. Please engage your brain when posting content.
6. Third Party Sites
Since our Site is built off of Content and sharing, you can be sure that you will encounter links to third party sites or Content that is being displayed from a third party site.

As such, you hereby agree that we are not liable for any privacy breaches that may occur as a result of the actions of third parties. In addition, how you interact with our Site may be shared with the third party service that you used to login, which means you are also storing information on their servers, which is governed by their own agreements.
