YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

A. You have the right to inspect and copy your PHI. If you would like to see or copy your PHI that is contained in a designated record set (e.g., medical and billing records), we are required to provide you access to such PHI for inspection and copying within 30 days after receipt of your request (with up to a 30-day extension if needed). We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover duplication, mailing and other costs incurred by us in complying with your request. In addition, there are situations where we may deny your request for access to your PHI. For example, we may deny your request if we believe the disclosure will endanger your life or that of another person. Depending on the circumstances of the denial, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed.
Under California law, we must permit you or your representative to inspect your medical records during business hours within five (5) working days after receipt of a written request by you or your representative.
California law further provides that you or your representative are entitled to copies of all or any portion of your patient records upon presenting a written request specifying the records to be copied, together with a fee to defray the cost of copying, that shall not exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page or fifty cents ($0.50) per page for records that are copied from microfilm and any additional reasonable clerical costs incurred in making the records available. We are required to ensure that the copies are transmitted within fifteen (15) days after receiving the written request.
