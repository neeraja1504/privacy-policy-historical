You should consult the respective privacy policies of these Sponsors and Causes. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Plus 3 reserves the right the add or remove Sponsors and Causes in its discretion and Plus 3 may not at all times list such updated partners in this Privacy Policy.
