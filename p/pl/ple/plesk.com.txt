Sharing of Information
In order for Plesk to execute its business processes in a convenient and optimal manner, it may be necessary for certain data to be processed by trusted 3rd parties. These 3rd parties may process payments, fulfill orders, send email or conduct other activities on behalf of Plesk. However, Plesk only shares such information needed to serve the specific purpose for which the 3rd parties were engaged. Plesk ensures that these 3rd parties are under similar obligations to maintain confidentiality as Pleskâ€™s own employees are and that they will handle your information in the way and to the extend as Plesk itself is permitted to. Plesk does not allow them to use your information for any unauthorized purposes.
Should Plesk merge with or be acquired by another company or Plesk sells product lines, service activities or other assets, it is likely your information will be transferred as is appropriate and relevant.

Information Retention & Destruction
Plesk only maintains your PII for as long as it is required to provide the requested services. When your PII is no longer needed to serve the purpose of its collection, Plesk periodically de-identifies the data, creating aggregated, anonymous records to aid the Plesk research and to improve Plesk products, services, and communications. Plesk employs data destruction techniques designed to completely destroy data and prevent any future recovery.
Cross-Border Disclosure of Data
Plesk will only disclose your information abroad if it is necessary for the intended purpose. All recipients of information are asked to agree by contract that they will observe the then-current internationally-accepted data protection regulations.
