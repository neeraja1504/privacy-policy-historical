Privacy policy | plotly
Last updated: July 24, 2015
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Plotly ( “Plotly” , “we,” or “us” ) and our Website at www.plot.ly (the “Site” ), as well as all related web sites, networks, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Privacy Policy (this “Policy” ) is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service” ). This Policy describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we appropriately use such information, and the steps we take to protect such information. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.
This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Plotly Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Plotly Terms of Use.
The information we collect
User-provided Information
When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called “personally identifiable” information, or “personal information,” which is information that specifically identifies an individual. Examples of personal information include name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal information also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual.
You may provide us with personal information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with personal information when you register for an account, use the Service, post User Content, interact with other users of the Service through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service-related requests. While we are generally responsible for the processing of personal information described in this Privacy Policy, Plotly only acts as steward for the data available through Plotly. Users or data contributors are responsible for any data submitted to or shared between users through Plotly.
Data
Any registered user can share content with other registered users or create content accessible to other users by creating, uploading, editing and analyzing information into shared workspaces stored on Plotly. By doing so, users create a record of their data and content and such Users are identified as the author of such data and content. These interactions reveal a contributor’s chosen user name and possibly other personal information such as posts, comments, research details, as well as contact information.
“Cookies" Information
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
“Automatically Collected" Information
When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
Third-Party Web Beacons and Third-Party Buttons
We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button.
Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and Plotly does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
Integrated Services
You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy.
You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
Information from Other Sources
We may obtain information, including your personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
Our Security Measures
Plotly uses the strictest security measures that are available for our cloud site. Plotly uses https, a protocol for secure network communication and Secure WebSockets to open interactive communication between a browser and a server.
We encrypt data in transmission with industry-standard SSL. Plotly uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our servers and data hosting—which has a robust security policy—so we use the same security measures AWS provides. Amazon’s data center operations have been accredited under: ISO 27001 SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE, 16/ISAE 3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II), PCI Level 1, FISMA Moderate, and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX).
We rely on best practices and extensive testing, both internally and externally--for example, using a Nessus Vulnerability Scan and Tenable Security to monitor vulnerabilities. All development is peer-reviewed and every engineer is trained on the OWASP Top 10.
We perform automated secure code reviews against the entire code base and correct issues prior to our releases. We continually test our applications, and monitor logs for exceptions and errors and remedy any irregularities. We perform a secure architecture design review for the applications provided. Our developers receive software security training (such as OWASP Top 1). Passwords are encrypted with PBKDF2.
The Plotly Cloud product and Plotly Enterprise product allow users to make a plot public, private, or secret. A public plot is accessible to other users on the web. Other users have the ability to fork their own version of a public plot, but cannot modify the original plot. A private plot can only be accessed by a logged-in user with whom the plot is shared. A secret plot has a shared key associated with the plot and plot URL. Only a user with the specific URL can access the plot. Secret plots can be embedded in other apps and websites and will only be accessible to an individual browsing that page. Users can share plots and files with other users to collaborate. Permission to edit and collaborate can also be revoked. For more information on sharing and permissions, see our privacy pages for R, Python, MATLAB, and Plotly Cloud.
An organizational account on Plotly cloud has an administrator who can add and remove users. Plotly Enterprise supports LDAP.

Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of the Service, such as a public profile page, will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users.
We work with third party service providers to provide website or application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your information as part of providing those services for us. Generally, we limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.

We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Service and any facilities or equipment used to make the Service available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.

We also may disclose your information as may be described in a notice to you at the time the information is collected, or in any other manner to which you consent.

Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner.

If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years of age has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at accounts@plot.ly and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our systems.
Data Security
We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.
We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
