Data
When you create content, the generators keep it live on our site for ten minutes. We only long-term store content that you elect to save. All content that’s not explicitly saved will be hidden from view ten minutes after creation and eventually deleted.
Some saved historic content may be deleted if it has not been accessed for a long period of time, so as to free up resources for new customers.
We store email addresses for the purposes of notifications about future developments. We only do this where you explicitly provide your email address for this purpose and click the verification link in a confirmation email.
When you leave comments on the Masterpiece Generator blog or creations themselves, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also your IP address and sometimes browser user agent string to help spam detection.
You have a right to see what data we store about you, and request changes if you wish, including having your data deleted.
