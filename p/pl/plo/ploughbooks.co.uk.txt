Some web browsers may transmit âdo-not-trackâ signals to our Website. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether you intend for these signals to be transmitted. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals.
