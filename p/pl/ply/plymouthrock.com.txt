Protecting Customer Information
The Plymouth Rock Group of Companies is committed to safeguarding your nonpublic personal information.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect such information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
You may have additional concerns about the privacy and security of information collected through our web site. We are committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to our web site, and as noted above maintain a variety of measures to secure your personal information. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, and there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures such as firewalls and encryption technology to protect your information. However, since no security system is absolutely impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet.
Our web site may contain links to other web sites. We have no control over the privacy practices or content of any other web sites we provide links to from our web site. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when linking to other web sites.
Former Customers
We protect information of our former customers in the same way as for our current customers.
Information We Collect
We collect and use information that we receive from your insurance application and through correspondence and communications from you; information about your transactions with us; information that you provide to us on our web site; information from independent insurance agents or brokers; information that we receive from consumer reporting agencies; information from website usage (or traffic); information from customer lists provided by other organizations and marketing data providers; information from governmental agencies and insurance-support organizations; information relating to insurance claims, which may include medical information; information from other third parties as permitted by law; and information that is publicly available from social media and other sources. This information enables us to underwrite policies, process claims, ensure proper billing, service accounts, and develop and sell our products. We also collect customer information from insurance agents who may use this web site to access our Agent Web interface. Agent Web allows insurance agents to make changes to policies, make payments, and inquire about the status of customer accounts.

We share information that we collect only as required or permitted by law to industry regulators, law enforcement agencies or other governmental authorities, anti-fraud organizations, consumer reporting agencies, third parties who assist us in processing transactions and in providing services to us; companies within the Plymouth Rock group; your insurance agent or broker (if applicable); third party financial institutions (such as insurance agents) with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to market products and services that we and they offer; attorneys or other authorized persons in connection with matters in litigation, as required by subpoenas and court rules and orders; our attorneys, accountants, and auditors; and such other parties as are permitted or required by law.
If you are a customer, we do not sell your information without your consent. However, if you have requested an on-line insurance quote from us, we may sell the information you provided us to one of our licensed independent insurance agents so that they may provide you with additional quotes from the companies they represent. As required by law, all agents participating in this program must sign a joint marketing agreement prohibiting the agents from using your information for any other purpose unless you choose to purchase a policy from them and become their customer.
We may use your personal information to respond to your inquiries, questions or comments if you access our web site or if you send us an email with questions or comments. We may save your questions or comments or your e-mail address for future reference.
