Security & Protection of Your Personal Information
We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard all the Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
The Company undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Information, preferences and other information it has collected through this Site and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside the Company other than as described herein.

You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your Company username and any password (if such is provided or enacted) are confidential, and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone.

As a result, while we strive to protect Personal Information that is transmitted to us by you, the Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Thus, any Personal Information transmitted to us is done so at your own risk. Once we receive Personal Information, the Company undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
