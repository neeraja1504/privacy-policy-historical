Itâ€™s advisable that parents should check the sites children visit and spend time online with them so as to make sure they do not engage in any illegal activity. Please, contact our Customer Support Staff 24/7 should you have any doubts with regards to any of our security policies. Our staff will gladly assist you any time you might need it.
