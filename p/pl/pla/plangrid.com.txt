PlanGrid | Privacy Statement
Effective Date: June 21, 2019
Protecting your privacy is important to PlanGrid. This Privacy Statement describes how PlanGrid, Inc. (“PlanGrid”) and its subsidiaries collect, use, and disclose personal data about you in connection with our construction productivity management and collaboration platform, our websites and apps, through related support and professional services, and through various sales and marketing activities.
PlanGrid is part of the Autodesk corporate family. In some cases, we share with and receive personal data from other Autodesk companies, including our subsidiaries, our parent company Autodesk, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, our “affiliates”).
Much of the personal data we collect through the PlanGrid services is processed on behalf of our customers and users. In some circumstances, we also process this personal data for our own purposes, as described below. However, we are not responsible for the data processing or protection practices of our customers, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Statement.
This Privacy Statement also does not apply to the collection of personal data by third-party websites or applications. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the respective third-party websites and applications with which you interact.

What Information Does PlanGrid Collect About You?
“Personal data” is information that identifies or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “personal data” and “personal information” have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.
We obtain personal information in different ways. Some is collected directly from you, such as when you sign up for an account or a newsletter on our website. Other information is automatically collected or generated about you when you use PlanGrid, including information obtained through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. We also obtain certain information about you from third parties, including when you provide your professional contact details and other information about you to those third parties. This Privacy Statement covers our handling of two general categories of personal data:
Personal data we handle for our customers and users in connection with providing PlanGrid services (“Service Data”) – We collect this information from our customers and users through various means, primarily through our construction productivity management and collaboration platform (including through user accounts on plangrid.com and our apps) and through related support and professional services. Because we receive information from or on behalf of our customers, Service Data may contain any type of information that our customers or their users provide. In most cases, this information is professional contact information and information that is linked to those contact details.
Personal data we handle for our own business (“Business Data”) – This includes certain information collected on or through our websites, such as information you submit via newsletter signup forms, information we automatically collect when you visit our websites, and information collected through our sales and marketing-related efforts.
Please note that we may be required by law to collect certain personal data about you, or as a consequence of any contractual relationship we have with you or our customer through whom you use the PlanGrid. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these obligations.
Information you provide us
We collect certain personal data directly from you. These types of information generally include:
Your contact details (e.g., name, email address, phone number, and mailing address)
Professional details (e.g., title and name of company)
Language preferences
Subscription plans
Details about products or services you have purchased or expressed interest in
Training and certification details
Event attendance details
Communication preferences
Your communications with us (e.g., feedback, requests, complaints, content you submit, and comments you post in our forums)
Payment information you provide when making a purchase directly from us
Please note that when you make purchases through the PlanGrid services, we use payment processors (such as Stripe) and do not store credit card or other financial information (other than confirmation that payment in a certain amount has been made). We collect contact information from you that we pass through to the payment processor to facilitate the transaction. For more information you can contact our providers as set forth in their privacy notices.
Information we obtain from your use of PlanGrid
We automatically collect and generate certain personal data about your use of PlanGrid. These types of information generally include:
System information and usage data relating to your use of PlanGrid (e.g., unique device identifiers, operating system, type of device you use, product ID, license information, which sites and applications you use and for how long, your city and country from your IP address, and information about your browser)
Error data (e.g., information relating to technical errors that may occur when you use our applications, if you choose to send the relevant report to us)
Automatic updates (e.g., information that may identify you to our system administrator in connection with the automatic update process, including user login name and computer’s name or description)
Information we generate about your use of PlanGrid (e.g., our understanding of your interests based on your use of our website, features of our services, etc.)
We also use cookies (small text files stored by your web browser when you use websites) and related technologies, such as pixels and beacons, to collect and store information when you use our platform, websites, and apps. For more information about cookies and other automated data collection tools, please see “Cookies and Automated Data Collection” below.
Social networking data – We have pages on social networking platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, where you can visit and communicate with us. The platform also includes buttons, tools, or content that links to another company’s services. We collect information about your use of these features through first- and third-party analytics tools.
If the PlanGrid services that you use contain plugins, information can be transferred directly from your device to the social networking provider. We have no influence on the data collected by the plugin. If you are logged in to the social network, a link can be established between your user account there and the use of the PlanGrid services.
If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking on “Like”, “Follow” or “Share”, or by writing a comment, this information may automatically appear in your profile on the social network. Even if you are not logged in, the plugins may send your IP address to social network providers. Please note this when using the PlanGrid services.
When you connect to a social networking service on a device that is also used by others, these other users are able to see information that is stored or displayed in connection with your profile on the social networking service page.
Information we collect from other parties
We obtain certain types of information from third parties, including Service Data we collect through our platform from our customers and users. We also obtain Business Data from our affiliates and from other third-party sources, such as employers, business partners, business contact databases, enrichment service providers, other third-party data aggregators, and social networking platforms (e.g., LinkedIn). Business Data we obtain from third parties may include contact details (e.g., name, email address, phone number, and mailing address) and professional details (e.g., title and name of company).

How Does PlanGrid Protect Children’s Information?

The PlanGrid services are generally designed for adult users. In some cases, we may offer the PlanGrid services to educational institutions, including high schools and universities.

As always, we urge you to be mindful when deciding to disclose personal data, including on the PlanGrid services. There are various places within our platform, websites, and applications that allow you to post content, including comments.
In some cases, you can limit who can view or access the information and content you post. In other cases, the information and content might be available to registered members of the platform, website, or application, or even to the general public. Your name, user name, profile image, or email address (particularly if this is your user name) may be posted along with any message or other content you post through our platform, websites, or applications.
If you are posting information you do not want to be disclosed publicly, make sure you are using a platform, website, or application that allows you to control who sees information you have posted.
