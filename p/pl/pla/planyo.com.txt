1. Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally
identifiable information may be requested.
2. The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Planyo website. The types of personal
information collected are:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone/mobile number
IP address
[Planyo site admins can request other information on booking page]
3. The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when making a reservation only to complete the reservation
details. We never share this information with outside parties except the administrator of
the resource/site you are reserving.
We use the email address to send you important information related to your
reservations such as reservation notifications and updated reservation
status (configured by the site admin), or, if you are a site admin,
important information related to your Planyo site in general. The email addresses are not
used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties except the administrator of the
resource/site you are reserving.
Some site admins can use your mobile phone number to send SMS messages
related to your reservations.
You can register with our website (with a login and password) if you
would like to be able to easily manage your reservations and to have your
personal information automatically filled out during future reservations.
We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design and promote our website but we would
not disclose anything that could be used to identify any individual.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above.
4. Where Is Information Kept and Who Can Access It
The only entities having access to customers' personal information
are:
- Site administrator and moderators who are obligated by law (e.g. GDPR in the EU) to keep
the personal information safe and used for the clearly defined purposes
- Xtreeme Sagl (creator of Planyo.com) headquartered in Lavertezzo, Switzerland
- Amazon SES (US-East Region)
We have agreements in place between Xtreeme Sagl (Planyo), Amazon SES
and the European Commission which ensure the compliance with the GDPR policies.
5. Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have
put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.
6. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never
collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 16, and
no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 16.
7. How You Can Access, Delete Or Correct Your Information
IF YOU HAVE A PLANYO LOGIN:
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain
by logging into your account and going to the My Account page. We use this procedure to better
safeguard your information. You can delete your account on that page.
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PLANYO LOGIN:
Go to https://www.planyo.com/login/delete-info.php where you can
request the personal information we keep on file to be sent to you for
a review with a possibility to delete all your personal information
from our databases. Note that if you have valid reservations in the
future or with end date less than 60 days ago,
you'll need to contact the site admin to have your personal
information removed OR you simply have to wait at least 60 days after
the rental time and request automatic removal.
You can also correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us
a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and
security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
