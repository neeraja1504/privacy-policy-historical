We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are intended to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Plantronics cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our products or services.

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.
Specifically, our Website servers are located in the U.S. and Australia, Singapore and Ireland, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken legal safeguards, including implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with the European Union data protection law.
