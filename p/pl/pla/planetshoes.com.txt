We receive and may store any information you enter on the Site. For example, we collect information from you when you place an order, create an account, call us with a question, write a review, or use any of our services.

The information we collect from you may also include information you give us about other people, such as the name and address of a gift recipient.
Automatic Information
Like many other websites, we also collect information through automated means. Although our site servers collect information about a user’s internet protocol address, our server is not able to automatically associate that information with a particular user. For example, we may collect non-identifying information associated with that address, such as the time and date of a visit, the originating domain name, the browser type, and the particular pages or products viewed on the site.
PlanetShoes.com may utilize a “cookie.” A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser to decline them. We use cookies on certain pages of our websites, but these cookies are not used to identify anonymous site visitors. Our cookies enable you to proceed smoothly through our sites and enable us to know whether you’ve visited our sites before to eliminate some steps that are directed to new visitors. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide you with advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does not include your personal information.
Image tags work in conjunction with cookies. An image tag, also referred to as a clear GIF or web beacon, is a small image file that may be located on select pages on our websites.
The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personal information about you is collected during this process. The information is anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. If you would like more information and want to explore the option of not having this information collected by third-party advertisers click here.
At this time, PlanetShoes.com has contracted with Google to collect information about how website users navigate our websites. This information will be used only to generate anonymous visitor profiles, which do not contain personally identifiable information. The anonymous profiles are used to provide website users content specifically tailored to them. To opt out of Google’s collection of information about how you navigate our websites, please go to http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
There are unrelated, third party web sites, such as third party online retailers, advertisers, or unrelated sites that we may link to, or that link to our website, these third parties may collect personal information directly from you. The information policies and practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties even if we provide hyperlinks or other access to their web sites. We are not responsible or liable for their independent policies and practices. Please review their privacy policies and practices.

Information Security
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable.
