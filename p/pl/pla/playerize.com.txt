Also, if you provide Personal Information in order to obtain access to the SuperRewards Services, we will use your Personal Information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.  For example, if you provide demographic data and contact information when you sign up to use our survey system, we will use that information you provide to provide services to you and for other purposes identified in this policy.

Cookies are files that can contain specific user information, such as User ID, or they can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). SuperRewards uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, to diagnose problems on our servers and administer the SUPERREWARDS Services.

Security Limits.  Despite the security measures described above, SuperRewards strongly recommends that its customers take measures to ensure the security of their data across any Internet connection. Like any high-speed service, including DSL and cable, the SuperRewards Services are not inherently secure. We recommend the active use of security solutions such as personal firewalls, anti-virus software, virtual private networks and encryption, though we do not provide these solutions for our users and cannot guarantee their effectiveness. It is the user's responsibility to evaluate their personal needs and workplace requirements, and obtain and properly configure appropriate security measures.
Tracking Unlawful Use of SuperRewards Services.  On occasion, it may be necessary to record and trace individual usage and/or personal or technical information in order to maintain the integrity and security of the SuperRewards Services.

Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your device by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers.  For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).
