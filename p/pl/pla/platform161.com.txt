Details about the ad serving technology
Platform161 offers ad serving technology which enables its clients to engage in online advertising. Our clients are all kinds of businesses engaged in online advertising: advertisers, ad networks, media agencies, and publishers. These clients buy online ad space. When ad space is sold to a client of Platform161, Platform161’s technology fulfils this transaction by delivering the ad of an advertiser (on behalf of the client) on that site.
In practice, you come into contact with Platform161 when you by means of e.g. your computer, tablet or smart phone – view an ad that has been served by Platform161 on website.
The ads sent by Platform161 are sent from the domain ads.creativeserving.com and/or ads.p161.net.
Platform161’s Technology
Introduction
The ad serving technology offered by Platform161 delivers an ad on a website. The technology uses information collected from several sources to decide the best and most relevant ad to display to you.
Tracking technologies used, data collected and purposes
This section of the policy describes the technologies used to help deliver the most relevant ad to you:
Cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored within a browser.
Platform 161 drops cookies through every ad it serves for the following purposes:
1. For Targeting and Optimisation:
(a)    to recognize a user ID visiting a website (user matching);
(b)    as part of the (targeted) ad serving process;
(c)    to collect information about the user’s online interaction (over multiple websites) and use that information to build user profiles;
(d)    to maintain a list of ads previously delivered by the technology of Platform161;
(e)    to remember the number of times the same ad was delivered to a user;
2. For Reporting and Attribution:
(f)    to collect the number of times a user clicked on an ad served by Platform161 (on behalf of a client) and
(g)    to track and assess the number of times a user engages in a business transaction (i.e. makes purchases) on the site of an advertiser.
(h)   to determine, count and attribute conversions. For example: a user clicks on an ad served by Platform161 on a website. Once on the website the ad links to, the user makes a purchase on that website. This purchase is counted by means of cookies.
Platform161 uses the following types of cookies:
Next to the data that are being gathered by Platform161 through dropping our own cookies, third party data can also be used to optimize our campaigns. These third party data come from third party data providers that live up to current law and industry standards.
Platform161’s cookies will be stored for 2 years after being dropped on a device.
*  Ad tags. Platform161’s technology responds to requests from ‘ad tags’ placed on the website you are visiting. Ad tags provide Platform161 with information and enable Platform161 to determine the correct size and location of an ad.
*  Pixel tags. Platform161 also uses pixel tags (also known as javascript or 1×1 pixels) to drop cookies. A pixel tag is a tiny graphic or script placed on a website that is not visible to the user. These pixel tags communicate with the technology of Platform161 and enable Platform161 to recognize a user by means of its UUID, or in the event that no UUID has been assigned to a user, to drop a cookie on the user’s equipment and assign a UUID to the user. The use of pixel tags allows Platform161 to measure campaign effectiveness, to optimize campaign performance and to provide more relevant advertising.  Pixel tags furthermore allow Platform161 to create and identify consumer segments and to select the appropriate ad based on the consumer segment.
Transparency, Choice and Opt-In:
Platform161’s technology uses cookies for ad selection in order to enhance ad effectiveness. Platform161 believes that the tracking technologies used by Platform161 and described above enhance your web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant ads delivered to you. However, you may not want, for example, cookies to be stored on your equipment or information to be collected by using these cookies. We will therefore only drop a cookie on your computer if you have consented or opted-in for this.
We also provide you with the possibility to no longer accept Platform161’s cookies. To enable our cookies please click ‘opt-out’.

Data Controller, Data Collected, Purpose:
Besides the data collected when a cookie is dropped, the Platform161 technology also collects the following possible personal data: such as the date and time of ad delivery to a user, the IP-address, postal code, region and country of a user, language setting, the type of browser, operating system used and connection speed, status of a user (unknown, accepting or not accepting cookies), the web page address(es) where the ad has been delivered, and administered clicks on ads. This information helps our technology to decide the best and most relevant ad to display to a user.
Platform161’s technology collects and stores aggregated ad delivery reporting data. This data is used to provide our clients with campaign reporting and used for billing purposes. A typical report includes information about the ads delivered, including the date and time of ad delivery, the websites on which the ads were shown, and statistics on user response. A report also includes statistics about browser types, date and time of ad delivery, and inferred geography.
Finally, the information collected (by means of cookies and/or other tracking methods) is processed for internal purposes  only : i.e. to possibly build user profiles that enable Platform161 to optimize and personalize advertiser campaigns.
To the extent that the data referred to above constitutes personal data within the meaning of the Dutch Data Protection Act, Platform161 will act as a data controller within the meaning of the Dutch Data Protection Act with respect to the processing of such data.
3rd party syncing :
Platform161 performs cookie syncing (aka: user synching, user matching or cookie matching) which is one of the generic methods used in the online advertising space to recognize user IDs across technology vendors like DSP’s, SSP’s and DMP’s.
In some countries Platform161 clients are obliged by regulation to inform users about the cookies on their site and the data that is collected, with which means and with what purpose.
When working with Platform161, it is only necessary to inform and get approval for Platform161 technology. In approving usage of Platform161 technology, a user also approves any other technology that is used in the Platform161 space that is needed to perform their technical operations.
Still, it is advised to mention in the privacy policy or ad notice that other technologies’ cookies are potentially used through Platform161. You can refer to this Privacy page to give users the possibility to see which technologies are used.
