Privacy Policy | Dauntless
Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.
REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
Any personal information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective. This Privacy Policy applies to all of Phoenix Labs’ operating divisions and affiliates.
COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION – WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We collect your personal information in the following ways:
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE DIRECTLY TO US
Third-Party Application Information. If you access our Services through a third-party application, such as the Epic Platform on Playstation 4 or Xbox One, we may collect information about you from that third-party application that you have made available via your account settings. This may include your third-party application username and email address.
Account Information.  If you create an Account directly with the Services, we’ll collect information that we associate with your Account, including your username, email address, and date of birth.
Your Information Requests.  If you ask for information about the Services or notification as to when certain Services will be available, you may provide information about yourself that will enable us to respond to your request. We will use this information to respond to your request and will not transfer it to third parties.
Customer Service. If you contact customer service, we may use the information you provide to us to look up your information in the relevant customer service database and fulfill your request.
Posting on the Services.  We may offer interactive features such as publicly accessible forums or blogs where you may post content. You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself in these forums, all such content will be public. Phoenix Labs and other individuals who use our Services may collect the information you submit or make available through these interactive features.
Surveys.  From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information that could identify you. We may use such information to improve our Sites and/or Services.
Transaction Information.  When making purchases through the Services, our third-party payment processor will collect personal information such as your name, postal address, country, phone number, and credit card number. We do not store this information, and our payment processor will not share this information with us.
Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests.  Occasionally, we may run sweepstakes and contests in which we ask participants to provide contact information (e.g., an e-mail address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.
INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT
Information Related to Use of the Services.  Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, location information (including inferred location based off your IP address), assumed language, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, in-game actions and behavior, and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services. We analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to market and promote the Services and to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
Game Play Data.  We automatically collect and store Users’ game play history and their progression through the games we offer. We use this data to administer, improve, and provide the Services to Users.
Cheat Data. We and our third-party service providers may collect, analyze and publish information about your game play and your device to detect and deter cheating
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.  Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies, Web Beacons, and other similar technologies to collect certain information.
“Cookies”  are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies (including the use of Google Analytics Cookies) to monitor usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.

Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.
“Web Beacons”  (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags, including third party pixel tags, or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the User’s device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third party websites within their networks.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.  We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
