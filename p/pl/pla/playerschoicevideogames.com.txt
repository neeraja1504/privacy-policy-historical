1) This store does collect demographic data and personal data to provide you a better internet experience.
2) Your personal details will remain private and confidential. We will never sell, rent, barter or share your personal details in any way with any other company. All data collected is for our internal use only.
3) We hate spam as much as you do. Actually, I think we hate it more since we get something like 100-odd junk e-mails each day. So, we will NEVER send you any unsolicited e-mail. If you choose to subscribe to our free weekly newsletter, you will receive your newsletter once every week. Clear unsubscribe details are always shown on the newsletter.
4) If you choose not to receive our free weekly newsletter, we will only contact you to answer your queries and/or send you your order confirmation. We will not contact you anytime else.
5) We may from time to time, send you pertinent information on special offers, giveaways or special discounts should you choose to subscribe to it. In any case, you will receive no more than one (1) of such e-mail every week.
6) This site does use cookies. However, we do not keep any of your personal details on cookies. We simply store your Customer ID (just a number) in cookie format. This Customer ID does not correlate to any of your personal information. We also store your first name on cookie format to personalise this website. This cookie is only present if you have not registered as a member of our site. If you are a member, then the only cookie that we use is the Customer ID cookie.
7) We may from time to time post up surveys to measure your response to certain new additions to the website. As a rule, you are never forced to fill in these surveys. Furthermore, should you choose to fill in the surveys, you can choose to remain anonymous.
