CHILDREN
If you are under 16, you will need the permission of your parent or guardian before registering on any ECB Website and we may require your parent or guardian to confirm that they have given permission. We may ask for their contact details so that we can check that they have done so and may carry out checks to confirm that the details you have given us are correct.
We normally only send newsletters and offers and opportunities to those under 16 where their parent or guardian has given consent to them being sent. Parents or guardians of those under 16 can change their mind at any time (see ‘Newsletters, Offers and Opportunities’ below).
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
In order to provide you with the services you require, the ECB will obtain personal information about you (and your parent or guardian if you are under 16) from ECB Websites, telephone conversations, emails and written and verbal communications. These will include, for example, your name, address, email address, phone number and details that are relevant to the service(s) in which you are interested. Occasionally we may ask for date of birth, for example, where the service you require has age related restrictions or ethnicity information to enable us to monitor and ensure compliance with anti-discrimination policies.
We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as Cricketing Organisations and ECB Partners.

If you provide information to us about any person other than yourself, you must ensure that they understand how their information will be used and that you are authorised to disclose it to us, and to consent to its use on their behalf, before doing so.

Disclosing your personal information
