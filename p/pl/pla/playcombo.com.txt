Privacy Policy Playcombo Games ("Playcombo") is committed to ensuring our websites (www.playcombo.com; www.playcombo.; www..playcombo.*) and any published apps (under the publisher name: Playcombo or Playcombo Games) are fun and safe environments. Playcombo does not actively run a user registration system, forum, chat or instant messaging function and thereby does not directly collect any personally identifiable information about our users unless they directly contact us or respond to a feedback survey and provide such information.
Some games featured or hosted on Playcombo that are managed by third-party publishers may contain features such as user registration systems, forums, chat rooms and so forth; which are not managed by Playcombo and are dictated by the privacy policy of the game's publisher.
Playcombo does however collect some basic browsing related data for advertising and analytics purposes. Please consult the below privacy policy which contains further details:
Cookies and data collected:
Playcombo collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website through the use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s).
