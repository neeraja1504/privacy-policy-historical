INTRODUCTION
The following presents important information relating to Playpen's comprehensive Privacy Policy. By using our sites, you signify your agreement to the privacy policies described herein. If you do not agree with our privacy policies, please do not use our site or service. Because protecting your privacy is very important to Playpen, we have established a privacy policy that safeguards your personal information, and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection and use of personal information, or Individual Information (as defined below), to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. There are a limited number of situations where we may disclose your personal information to others without first receiving your consent: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm the property or rights of Playpen or those of Playpen customers or chat hosts, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of Playpen, its employees, users or the general public, (5) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our companyâ€™s assets or the sale of an entire web site or business division or (6) in order to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.
Types of Individual Information
Individual Information is any information, data or records that relate to your Playpen membership or use of Playpen and identifies you or your individual Member account. The four types of Individual Information are;
"Identity and billing information," such as your name, street address, telephone number, billing information, and any screen names associated with your account;
"Navigational and transactional information," such as information about where you go or what you buy through Playpen;
"Private communications," such as the contents of email, IM, or private chat room communications.
"Public communications," such as the contents of comments, ratings, or chat.
MEMBER IDENTITY AND BILLING INFORMATION
Collection and Storage
We may maintain the following types of identity and billing information: your name, street address, telephone number(s), length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep information on your communications with our Customer Service department and Models, and general account history, such as accumulated usage credits or written complaints relating to your account. We safeguard Individual Information from unauthorized access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted access to Members' Individual Information. Employees who violate Playpen privacy policies are subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate. We may use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage, processing, and other limited functions on Playpen's behalf.
Use
We use identity and billing information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed and offer you opportunities (e.g. advertisements or email) that may be of interest.
Disclosure
We do not release Members' telephone numbers, credit or debit card numbers, or checking account or other bank account numbers (or other Individual Information, such as navigational or transactional information or private communications content). Our policy is not to disclose identity information to third parties that would link a Members screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required to do so by law or legal process served on Playpen (e.g. a subpoena). Playpen, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances on a case-by-case basis. When feasible, we do allow our Members to access and verify their Member Identity and Billing Information. We also allow our Members to request corrections to this Information. Playpen intends to abide by applicable laws governing the disclosure to governmental entities of Individual Information and other records. If we are under a legal obligation to disclose Individual Information to a private citizen or entity, we may make efforts under the circumstances to notify the affected Member(s) in advance of releasing it in order to provide the Member(s) an opportunity to pursue any available legal protection.
Compelling Obligation
Although Playpen will take reasonable measures not to disclose information about you or the contents of your communications, we may be compelled to do so in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce these terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (e) to protect the interests of Playpen or others.
