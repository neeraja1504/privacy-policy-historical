Information We Collect.
Online: You may visit our Website anonymously. We collect your Internet Protocol address, but
this information generally does not reveal your identity. The data that we regularly collect about
visitors to our Website (e.g., browser type, pages accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not enable
us to identify you. We use "cookies," small files that are sent to your browser and stored on your
hard drive, to identify you as a unique user on our Website. Our use of cookies is explained in
more detail below. We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you
voluntarily provide it to us by requesting information, products or services from us.

customer relationship with Company or to consider you for a job with Company. Once an

purchasing and payment history. If you are hired by Company, we may collect information about
your salary and benefits, qualifications and performance.

you find the nearest branch to your current location; and (b) If you choose to provide a photo for

Online: When you visit our Website, you may provide personally identifiable information in
order to purchase products or take advantage of services or job opportunities offered through our
Website. For example, you might provide your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and

services we offer on our Website.
Offline: When you sign up for an account or otherwise do business with Company, you may
provide personally identifiable information of yourself, if an individual or sole proprietor, or the
company officers or contact persons, in addition to company information, if a company. We may
use that information to obtain a credit, D&B or similar report or otherwise evaluate your
eligibility for an account. When you apply for a job, you may provide personally identifiable
information, such as name, address, telephone number, email address, birthdate and SSN. We
may use that information to obtain a credit report, do a background or reference check or
otherwise evaluate your suitability for the job.
Information from Other Sources. From time to time we may purchase or otherwise acquire
information about you from other sources and add it to our database, including without limitation
updated delivery and address information.
How We Use Information. If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information,
we will use that information to respond to your inquiry or process your order or application. We
may provide this information to third parties if we believe in our discretion it would be helpful in
responding to you, or if this information is necessary for the third party to do their job (see
"Third Party Service Providers," below). If, in the future, we merge with or are acquired by
another company, or change our structure, we may transfer your personally identifiable
information to the surviving or acquiring entity. We will also disclose your personally
identifiable information if we believe in good faith we are required to do so (a) by law or to

activities and any information you disclose while visiting that Third Party Website. Third Party

binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. If any claim, dispute or controversy is not subject to binding arbitration, you agree
that the exclusive jurisdiction for that claim, dispute or controversy will be the state and federal
courts located in Dallas, Texas, that you will not file any action or proceeding in any other
jurisdiction; and that you waive any argument that Dallas, Texas is an inconvenient forum.

CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR PHYSICAL/EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL REXEL'S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES
EXCEED $50.
