Protecting Children
Playfuls.com is committed to protecting children from any content inappropriate for them to view or from anything which their parents do not want them to see. To this end all our forums are moderated and staff members are trained to watch for any inappropriate behavior. We also endeavor to stop children under 13 from accessing certain parts of the site by requiring confirmation of age.
The site is aimed at a general audience and has a strict policy against obscenity, racism, bigotry or sexism. However, it does review media and arts which cover a broad spectrum of subjects and have a variety of ratings. So we feel there is some content not appropriate for children under 13 years old.
We cannot accept any responsibility for persons accessing parts of the site against the wishes of their parents where we have been given false information. If you are concerned about anything you see on the site please do not hesitate to contact us. We can also provide some limited advice on protecting your children from inappropriate content.
