2. Information on the Types of Data Processed and Their Origin

a. Types of Data That We Automatically Collect
When you visit our website, you submit technical information to our servers. In any case, this data is recorded every time you visit our website:
Each time a page is accessed, access data is stored in a file, the so-called server log. The following data is stored:
The time, the status of your website visit (status means in this case whether the visit of the website was successful or not) as well as the request that your browser has made to the server to open the page, the amount of data transferred and the website from which you came to the requested page (referrer), and the product and version information of the browser used (user agent).
We also use cookies to process this data. Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your device that store the above information about you when you use our Service. If you want to know more about how cookies work, which cookies we use and how you can disable them, see the information in 4c below..
b. Types of Data You Transmit to Us
In addition to the data we receive from all website visitors, we also process additional data if user make this available, depending on how they use the Service. For instance, if you make use of a commenting functionality or when sending a message via a contact form, this type of data will then also be processed. When you contact Customer Service, written communications between you and our service team staff and notes on such transactions are stored so that we can provide uninterrupted customer service when the communication thread is followed up by other members of our service team.
3. Processing Purposes & Legal Bases
We process your data exclusively for the following defined purposes:
**
* To allow you and other users to use the Service and to ensure its functionality
* To continuously improve the service offer and to correct errors
* To detect and prevent fraud attempts
* To disclose your personal data to third parties if we are legally obliged to do so
* To assert legal claims and to defend against legal disputes
* To ensure IT security and operation of our systems
**
In doing so, we rely on various legal bases in accordance with the so-called General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union legal framework for the standardisation of data protection law (“GDPR” for short). We refer in detail to the following legal bases:
Your consent
When you visit the website, you agree to our cookie guidelines and to the processing of your IP address in a cookie bar. If you have given your consent to the processing of personal data for specific purposes, this consent ensures the legality of such processing.
Accordingly, if we process your data, it is because you expressly allowed us to do so. Your consent is therefore the most important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by us. If you provide us with information about your sexual orientation or preferences, we will process this data principally on the basis of your consent.
Safeguarding legitimate interests
By registering to use the Services, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. That is why we process your data, in principle, because you have allowed us to do so. However, there are some cases in which we would be entitled to process your data without your consent because it is necessary to protect our legitimate interests (or the interests of third parties). In this respect, the purposes for which we process your data also represent legitimate interests. We pursue legitimate interests, for example, if we check images or texts for content relevant under criminal law or if we take measures to secure virtual domiciliary rights. In these cases, we will not ask you in advance whether you agree to this processing, as processing is otherwise permitted.
Legal requirements or public interest
In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution in individual cases upon request.
4. To Whom do we Transmit Your Data?
We treat your personal data with care and confidentiality and will only pass them on to third parties to the extent described below and not beyond.

c. To Third Parties & Cookies
In addition, we transmit data to external service providers that enable us to provide the Services. These include hosting providers and providers of analytics platforms.
