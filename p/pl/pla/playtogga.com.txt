It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Website. As used in this document, "Personal Information," means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, employment information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile device, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information and the page you request. This information is not deemed by Togga to constitute Personal Information and while Togga will not use it in a way that associates such information with you, we may aggregate and use such information. Togga owns this information and may use it in any manner it deems appropriate.

Your web browser may allow you to opt-out of our collection of this information by selecting a “do not track” (or similar) setting. However, we do not currently have processes to address those settings or other “do not track” requests, and consequently, cannot guarantee that it will honor such requests. If you do not want us to collect this information, do not use the Website.
