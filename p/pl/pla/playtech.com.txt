(c) it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
Where we have a legal basis to use your personal information without consent (as we have described above), this policy fulfils our duty to process personal data fairly and lawfully and in a manner that you would expect given the nature of our relationship with you, by giving you appropriate notice and explanation of the way in which your personal information will be used.
Where consent is required for our use of your personal information, by ticking the appropriate consent box or otherwise communicating your consent (for example, by email or providing non mandatory information), you consent to our use of that personal information for the purposes covered by the specific consent that you have given.  For example, we will only process your personal information for marketing purposes if we have your consent to do so.
Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.
5. If you fail to provide personal information
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to progress any of your recruitment applications, or provide you with access to our Portal.
6. Change of purpose
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

8. Transferring information outside the EU
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to the USA which is outside the EU in order for the functioning of the Portal and to allow your use of it. There is not an adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of the USA. This means that the transfers to the USA of your personal information are not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
However, to ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection we have put in place the appropriate measures (such as contractual agreements to meet EU-approved data protection obligations or having signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield) to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection. If you would like to find out more about this or obtain a copy of the relevant approved contract, please contact our DPO (whose role we have explained in more detail in paragraph 12) by email at privacy@playtech.com.

All information you provide to us is stored on secure severs. We will use technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the * Portal * and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
10. Data retention
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
Once you are no longer a user of the Portal or, if appropriate, an employee, worker or contractor of the company we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
