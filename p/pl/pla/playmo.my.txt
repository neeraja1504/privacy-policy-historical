PlayMo employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information. PlayMo may share your personally identifiable information with outside contractors or agents who help manage our information activities (i.e., administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide PlayMo with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
PlayMo may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows PlayMo to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on PlayMo's website(s). Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities on PlayMo's website(s) may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with PlayMo’s advertisers and business partners. Such information may include:
Visitors’ IP address
