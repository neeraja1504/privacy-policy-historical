How does Plastiq secure Personal Data?
Credit and debit card data is stored and managed in compliance with strict Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. Plastiq utilizes tokenization, a payments industry-standard procedure, to limit exposure of sensitive cardholder data. Your credit and/or debit card information is sent directly to our secure, encrypted data vault, which generates a random, cryptographically secure token that is used by our payment application to submit payments on your card. Once information is deposited into the vault, it cannot be directly retrieved by our payment application or any third parties.
Although no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure and error free, Plastiq takes great care to protect Personal Data collected via this Website from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, in both transit and at rest. Access to user data is limited (via username/password authentication and 2-factor verification, among other safeguards) only to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. Connections to this Website are secured with an Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificate with 256-bit encryption, and our data centers, located in the United States, boast enterprise-level security with top-level industry certifications and fault-tolerant, distributed systems. Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, encrypted vault storage for sensitive data, strict hardware firewalls, and limited physical access to buildings, servers, and files.
As our data centers are located in Canada, your Personal Data may be available to the Canadian government or its agencies under a lawful order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Data.
We at Plastiq do our best to secure your data, and we ask that you take reasonable precautions as well. Ensure your personal computing device has up-to-date security and anti-virus software, and please consider carefully what information you choose to send anyone via the Internet and log of your account when you are finished using the Services and do not share your password with anyone.
