Updated: Friday 25th May, 2018
This policy covers the following Foxit Software Web site:
Planet PDF - http://www.planetpdf.com
As our user community--including visitors to any of our family of Web sites, discussion forum members, newsletter subscribers and customers--is our most valued asset, we will strictly adhere to the policy statement detailed below. Please take a few minutes to read the entire document so you understand when and why we request certain kinds of information, and what options you have for controlling your personal information.
Our Pledge to You
In short, we will make every effort to safeguard any information you may share with us through any of a variety of possible online exchanges and transactions. We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our sites unless you choose to provide such information to us.
We do not sell, rent, swap or otherwise disclose any personal information -- except in the specific case of sales or demo downloads of commercial software products. This exception is explained in Section D below.
A. Requesting Your Personal Information
While most information at the sites is freely available, at times we request certain personal information from users wishing to take advantage of specific opportunities. Providing identifying information is optional in some cases, required in others (e.g. PDF Store purchases {now defunct}).
We request your personal information -- which may include such things as email address, name, address, telephone number, etc. -- in exchange for certain activities, including:
one-time Planet PDF forum access registration (or use Read-Only guest access)
Planet PDF Newsletter subscriptions
Product demo downloads
Periodic surveys and/or contests
Other interactive components we may add to our sites
In order to activate your Planet PDF newsletter subscriptions you must fill out a one-time registration page which requires your email address and various demographic data about yourself. The registration must use a valid email address which must be confirmed via the confirmation email that is sent to the account. If your account is not confirmed through the email we will then discard the address and all information associated with it. We will not sell, rent, swap or otherwise disclose the information you used to register with.
B. Use of "cookies"
The sites make use of so-called "cookies," snippets of information that are transferred to the hard drives of users for various purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard and occurs at most major websites.
Planet PDF makes use of "per-session cookies" (to monitor traffic patterns), which is deleted when the user leaves the site. This cookie in no way identifies the user; its sole purpose being to monitor traffic patterns. Users can disallow this cookie by configuring their Web browser's preferences.
The discussion forum areas of each site require the use of a cookie to enable users to navigate between pages and participate in discussions. Choosing not to accept this cookie will mean the Planet PDF Forum will not function correctly.
C. Use of collected information
The Web sites use the information they gather for:
developing enhancements to its family of Web sites
restricting anonymous, inappropriate use of the discussion forums
delivering its free newsletter to subscribers
internal marketing and promotional purposes
In addition, we routinely track site traffic by analyzing our Web server logs, but nothing in that data reveals your personal identity. We use the log information (for example, length of session, pages viewed, etc.) to help determine overall traffic patterns, to determine user interests and to continue improving the site to better serve our user community.
From time to time, we may directly contact a user about a specific question, problem, comment or idea that he or she has posted -- we are always looking for user experiences to share with the rest of the community.
Our newsletter contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, we may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. This personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller.
E. Security
Our sites utilize state-of-the-art security technology to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of such information. Nonetheless, we are not responsible for any breach of its security or for the actions of any third parties that may obtain any personal information.
