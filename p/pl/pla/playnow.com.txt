BCLC's Three Pillars of Privacy
As a public body, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ("FIPPA") applies to BCLC. FIPPA directs how BCLC can use your personal information. BCLC's commitment to privacy is based upon three pillarsâ€“fairness, accountability and accessibility. These three pillars are designed to help BCLC meet its obligations under FIPPA.
BCLC strives to use fair information practices. This means:
1. Fairness
We provide you with clear and adequate notice when we collect your personal information (a "Privacy Notice") as required by the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ("FIPPA"). Note that in some situations, e.g. law enforcement, FIPPA does not require the provision of a Privacy Notice.
In every Privacy Notice, we state the purposes for which we will use your information and we obtain your explicit or implicit consent to allow us to use your personal information in accordance with the stated purposes.
We take steps to minimize the collection of sensitive personal information.
If we use your personal information to make a decision that directly affects you we make every reasonable effort to ensure that your personal information is accurate and complete.
We will not send you advertising or marketing information without your consent.
We will not sell your personal information to third parties. In some cases, we share your personal information with other companies that provide services on our behalf. In those cases, we only provide them with the information needed to perform those services and we also require them not to share your information with anyone else.
2. Accountability
BCLC is accountable for the ways in which we deal with your personal information. We do this by:
Developing and providing privacy training to all of our employees and key service providers so that each person who may handle your personal information understands how to protect that information.
Conducting regular reviews to make sure that our employees and key service providers have completed the training.
Using appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the personal information we collect.
Having an established chain for reporting and responding to privacy issues.
3. Accessibility
BCLC aims to be accessible. This means we will provide you with information about the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information, and provide you with access to that information upon request.
To review records containing your personal information, please submit a formal request under FIPPA by following the steps on the Freedom of Information Requests page.
Registration
In order to use PlayNow.com, you must first complete the registration form and create a user account. During registration you are required to provide personal information (such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address and credit card information). We use this information to verify your identity (BC Resident over age 19) and register you for our Site.
Deposit of Funds
Once registered for an account, you will need to deposit funds to use our Site and services. You must provide financial information, such as credit card number and expiry date. We use this information solely for the purpose of processing a deposit into your account. If there is difficulty processing the deposit, you will receive notification on your screen and will be prompted to contact your card issuer or BCLC Customer Support.
Withdrawal of Funds
In the event that you wish to withdraw funds from your account, we will collect your bank account information (transit #, institution #, account #). This information is used to facilitate the transfer of funds from your PlayNow.com wallet into your bank account, and is only accessed upon your request.
Surveys or Contests
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Sites. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose any personal information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, email address, and phone number), and demographic information (such as postal code and age group).
We use this information to track and target the interests of our users so that we can enhance the experience of users on our Sites. In the case of contests, this information is used to contact the winners to award their prize.
We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests and that company is prohibited from using our players' personal information for any other purpose.
Communications from the Sites
Upon registration, you are given a choice to subscribe to receive promotional communications about our products and services. You are able to change this subscription at any time by logging in and accessing the Edit Profile tab.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by:
following the "unsubscribe" link included in each email communication
selecting "No" to contact under Edit Profile on your My Account page
calling PlayNow.com Customer Support at 1-877-706-6789; or
completing the Contact Form on PlayNow.com
Please note, even if you unsubscribe from promotional communications, you will continue to receive important information about your account, including security information, transaction information and responses to your requests.
Identity Verification
To determine if you qualify to participate on our Sites, we use your name, address, date of birth and credit card information to verify that you meet our age (19+) and residency (B.C. residents only) requirements. A soft check against your credit file is performed as part of the verification process. This check will not affect your credit rating or credit score. Any personal information you provide will also be used to prove your identity if you contact BCLC Customer Support.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Personal information
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as credit card processors and email services providers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
We may also disclose your personal information:
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; and
to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
Agents/Service Providers
We use other third parties such as an email or text messaging service provider to send emails and SMS (text messages) on our behalf, a mobile vendor to develop and host our webapp and a credit card processing company to bill you for services. We will share your name, email address, and financial information as necessary for the third party to provide these services.
Tracking Technologies
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts (e.g. Google Analytics) are used by BCLC and our marketing, advertising and analytics service providers. These technologies are used to analyze trends, understand user behaviour, gauge effectiveness of our campaigns, enhance the efficiency of our operations, make our Sites easier to use, and to administer the Sites.
We may gather information including clickstream data (which is data that tracks users' movements around the Sites), number of visitors to the Sites, number of visitors to a page by the hour, visitors' activities (such as commencing the registration process), browser type, operating system and demographic information about our user base as a whole. We access reports based on the use of these technologies from companies we use to compile this information. All this information is collected anonymously and in aggregate.
We use cookies to remember users' settings, to deliver more relevant advertising and to modify the frequency and content of our advertising. You may control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited.
If you'd like to opt out of having your information tracked by Google Analytics, download an add-on for your browser here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. If you'd like to opt out of information tracked by mouseflow, turn on the 'do not track' option in your browser or visit https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/ and click on "Disable".
Log Files
We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, location coordinates, operating system, date/time stamp, device make and model, player ID and transaction activities and winnings . This information is only used to monitor activity on our systems for security and fraud investigation purposes and to comply with applicable laws. We do not use or combine this information with other identifiable information we collect about you without your consent.
Location Information
We acquire location information (i.e. IP addresses and location coordinates) when you login and periodically while you are logged in to ensure players are accessing their account from within British Columbia and where necessary, to assist in security and fraud investigations. This information may also be collected in aggregate format for analytical purposes.
In order to access your account (e.g. to view your transactions, play games or purchase lottery tickets), location services on your device must be turned on. You also have the option to turn off location services on your device or deny the permission request for location when logging in. This will result in you not being able to access your account but you will still be able to view the Sites.
We do not use or combine this information with other identifiable information we collect about you without your consent unless required for security and fraud investigations and to comply with applicable laws.
Behavioural Targeting
We partner with third party marketing and advertising organizations to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other websites.

If you do wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.
Flash LSO's
We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash to store content information and preferences.
