When Planbox acts as the data controller, you have the right to review and change your personal information that you have provided us. We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested us to remove in order to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests .
As a data subject whose personal data is processed by Planbox for the Purposes mentioned above, in applicable circumstances you have the right to access your Personal Information, request a copy of (e.g. for transfer to another IT environment), and request to update or correct, your personal data held by Planbox. To the extent that the processing of Personal Information by Planbox occurs on the basis of your consent (such as your right to prevent your Personal Information to be used for direct marketing) you have the right to withdraw such consent. Such withdrawal will however not restrict Planbox in continuing to process Personal Information if the justification therefore does not rely on your consent and is still necessary for any of the mentioned Purposes. You also have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information by Planbox , to request that Planbox restrict the processing of your Personal Information or request that Planbox erase your personal data, all on the grounds mentioned in the Regulations. Planbox will respond to all such requests in accordance with the Regulations.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent personal data protection authority if you believe that the processing of your Personal Information is not in compliance with Regulations, or if Planbox does not respond to your requests in timely and/or appropriate manner, or if they are not answered at all.
Data retention
When Planbox acts as the data processor, a separately executed Master Service Agreement or Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) between Planbox and the Customer defines Planbox retention policy and data processing obligations.
When Planbox acts as the data controller, Planbox will only store your personal data for the duration necessary and in a manner permitted by the Regulations or other applicable laws. We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
When Planbox acts as the data controller, you have the right to exercise your Right To Be Forgotten via a request sent to privacy@planbox.com.
