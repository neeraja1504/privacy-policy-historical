If you linked to the City of Plano website from another website, the address of that website.
We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.
Links to Non-City of Plano Sites
The City of Plano website and all its related departmental websites have links to many other governmental agencies and organizations, both public and private.
