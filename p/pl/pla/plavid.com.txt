By default , almost all web browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. Visitors/Users can still change the default configuration, as best illustrated below in this very same Policy.
Some cookies are necessary for the proper provision of the Web sites or Platforms, useful for their personalized fruition; in this case, their inhibition could compromise some functionalities of the website.

This type of cookie avoids the use of other technologies that could compromise the privacy of the navigation of the users;
