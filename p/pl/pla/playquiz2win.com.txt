What is a Web Beacon?
Web beacons are small strings of HTML code that are placed in a Web page.

DoubleClick uses Web beacons in connection with its products and services, including ad serving and paid search listings (“DART Search”).

It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.
