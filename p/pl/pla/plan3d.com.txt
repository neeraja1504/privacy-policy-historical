We may collect certain personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink) and information about your hardware settings (e.g., the type of 3D video card, CPU speed, amount of memory and so on) to provide you with technical support and to allow plan3D to operate correctly on your computer.
REGISTRATION: In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  During registration you are also required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.   This information may be used to send you information about your membership such as newsletters, upgrade information, renewal notices, etc.

You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
Owner of Information Collected
Plan3D, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on the plan3D web site (we don't share ownership with other companies). Plan3D collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
How We Use This Information
We may use information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you - although we will never give your information to other people or companies outside plan3D without your explicit permission.
We may use this information to communicate with you, when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
We sometimes use the personally identifiable information that we collect about your computer hardware to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience and to provide technical support. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services from time to time.
Employees and contractors of Plan3D who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Plan3D.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
Finally, Plan3D sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.
We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
Information Shared During Order Processing
We use other third parties to provide online order processing on our site.  When you sign up for plan3D, we will share your name, address and credit card information with Verisign corporation, PayPal, and E-Merchants Bank as necessary for them to process the credit card order so we can provide the plan3D service to you.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to confirm that you are authorized to use the credit card, process the financial transaction for plan3D.
Collection of Information by Third Party Sites
Plan3D sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Plan3D has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. Plan3D will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.
Use of Cookies
To enhance your experience at Plan3D, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
Security Practices
The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at support@plan3D.com

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
