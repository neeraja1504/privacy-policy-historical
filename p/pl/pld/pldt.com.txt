Privacy Policy | Official PLDT Website
**
Our Privacy Commitment
The PLDT Group of Companies respects our customers’ fundamental right to privacy, and we commit to take great care in safeguarding your personal data. The PLDT Group has developed a Privacy Policy that aims to ensure that all PLDT Group Companies and Subsidiaries adopt and observe appropriate standards for personal data protection in compliance with Republic Act No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and its implementing rules and regulations.  While the PLDT Group Privacy Policy sets out the general principles that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of our customers’ personal information, we have also developed this Privacy Commitment to inform you more specifically about our privacy practices. **
**Why we collect your personal information  **
If you are a customer of a PLDT Group Company or Subsidiary, we collect and maintain some basic information about you. We do so only for the following purposes:
To create and nurture a relationship with you, so that we can continuously provide you with our services. For example, when you apply for any of our services, we collect personal information about you that will allow us to validate your identity and credit history for purposes of billing and collection of fees for the products and services that you avail from us.
To improve our products and services. We collect, use, process, and analyze how you use our products and services so that we can understand how to improve them for your benefit.
To understand your needs and preferences so that we can serve you better. Maintaining a record of the products and services that you avail from us allows us to gain a better insight of the kinds of offers that would be relevant to your preferences. From time to time, we may send you product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.
To continuously improve our business and operations. For example, we analyze customer usage of our network and facilities to help us manage your account, provide customer care activities, monitor the quality and security of the network, train our staff, and plan for future growth.
To assist the Government. We generate statistical insights based on your usage of our network and facilities to assist the Government in planning for healthcare, disaster management, and other similar initiatives.  When we can, we aggregate and anonymize this information such that you are never identified as an individual. [Aggregating simply means presenting information in segments or categories like age groups; anonymizing means removing personally identifiable information from the data].
To comply with the Credit Information System Act. We run credit scoring programs and initiatives, including but not limited to, providing information to the Credit Information Corporation in accordance to Republic Act No. 9501.
To meet legal and regulatory requirements. We perform such other processing or disclosure that may be required under pertinent laws, rules, or regulations.

We will never share, rent or sell your personal information to third parties outside of the PLDT Group of Companies except in special circumstances where you may have given your specific consent for, and as noted in this policy.
In some instances, we may be required to disclose your personal information to our agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and other third party agencies as part of our regular business operations and for the provision of our products and services.  This means we might share your information with:
Our partner companies, organizations, or agencies including their sub-contractors or prospective business partners that act as our service providers, contractors, professional advisers who help us provide our products and services.  For example:  our couriers for bill delivery and our customer contact centers for our pre- and post-sales hotline operations;

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, law enforcement and government agencies; and
Other companies whom you have also given consent to share your information.

That’s why we strictly enforce our Privacy Policy within the PLDT Group and have implemented technical, organizational and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from destruction, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, fraudulent misuse and/or any other unlawful processing, as well as other natural and human dangers.
We also put in effect safeguards such as:
We keep and protect your information using a secured server behind a firewall, encryption and security controls;
We keep your information only for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the information was obtained or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or for legitimate business purposes, or as provided by law;
We restrict access to your information only to qualified and authorized personnel who handle your information with strict confidentiality.

We promptly notify you and the National Privacy Commission, when sensitive personal information that may, under the circumstances, be used to enable identity fraud are reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person;
We let you update your information securely to keep our records accurate.
The PLDT Group of Companies will not collect, use, or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than those identified in this Commitment, your Service Agreement or our Terms of Service, and any other purpose that you may have given your consent for.
For greater clarity, unless you provide specific consent, we will not:
Share your personal information with or sell it to our business partners and third-party service providers; or
Use your personal information to enable third-party targeted advertisements.
What your choices are
You are afforded certain rights in relation to your personal data under the Data Privacy Act. We would like to ensure that we have your consent to continue to collect, use, and disclose your personal information for the purposes that we have identified. At the same time, we want you to know that you do have choices and can object or withdraw your consent and/or edit your consent preferences at any time:
If you wish to have access to your personal information in our records; or you think that such personal information we have of you is incomplete, not up-to-date, or otherwise inaccurate, you may get in touch with the PLDT Group Data Privacy Officer through the contact details provided below.  In some instances, we may request for supporting documents or proof before we effect any requested changes to your personal information.

You will always be provided notice if these changes are significant and, if we are required by law, we will ensure to obtain your updated consent.
