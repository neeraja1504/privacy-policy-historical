If you do not agree to the policy, please do not use the Sites.
We suggest you review this Privacy Policy periodically, as it may be updated from time to time. We will post a current version on the Sites.

Social Media and User-Generated Content
Peet’s website allows you to share product reviews with us. Please use this feature responsibly. We monitor reviews to make sure that only appropriate content is shared through our Sites. Please review our Terms and Conditions of Use for additional information about your responsibilities when posting product reviews.
We also maintain a social media presence, such as a Peet’s Facebook page and Peet’s Twitter feed. You can interact with us through social media, such as by entering our contests, posting content, sharing material from Peet’s websites, and using our social media plug-ins. When you interact with us using social media we may receive information such as your user ID, your profile picture, photos you post, and similar information, which is often determined by your privacy settings at social media sites. We may use the information for the same types of purposes we describe throughout this Privacy Policy. Your use of social media sites is primarily governed by the site operators’ privacy policies and terms of service, and the information you share with us and with others is largely controlled by the privacy settings you have established at those sites.
Automated Collection and Use of Information
As referenced above, we receive or collect some information automatically when you visit our Sites or engage with other online content we provide. For example, we receive the IP address or other identifier for the computer or other device you use to access our Sites, which may reveal your general geographic location. We collect or receive other information using technology features such as:
Cookies. A cookie is a file saved to your computer or device that may be used to recognize our users when they return to our Sites, collect usage information, remember user’s preferences, and provide customized versions of our Sites. We use this information to evaluate our web traffic, enhance our communications, understand the effectiveness of our ad or promotional campaigns, and improve our website and services, including providing you with interest-based ads. For more information on our advertising, see below: “Interest-Based Advertising.” For more information on your choices regarding cookies, see the “Your Choices” section below.
Web Beacons. Our Sites may use web beacons, pixels, javascript, or other electronic markers that monitor some types of use. These beacons may provide us with information such as the IP address of the computer or other device you used to access our Sites. We use this information to understand patterns of activity on our Sites, to improve features, and to customize our presentation of content to our users, including our advertising. We may work with service providers that help us track, collect and analyze this information.
Interest-Based Advertising. We provide interest-based advertising about our products and services on other parties’ websites. We may use third-party advertising companies that use tracking technologies to serve our advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Sites and other websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. These advertising companies serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites, and some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information collected about your visits to this Sites and elsewhere over time. Other companies may also use such technology to advertise on our Sites. You have the choice to tell us not to collect and use this information, and in some jurisdictions, we will only engage in interest-based advertising if you opt-in.

Peet’s may develop content and advertising based on the analytics and user information developed from cookies or similar technology. For more information on your choices regarding advertising, see the “Your Choices” section below.
Referrer Headers. We may record referrer headers when you follow links to our Sites, which may be sent to us automatically by your web browser. In these cases, we may receive information such as the URL of the website that referred you to our Sites, or search queries you used to find our Sites. We use this information to understand our web traffic, to improve our services, to increase their accessibility to search engines and others, and to monitor our advertising campaigns.
How We Share Your Information
We may share personal information with trusted parties, such as service providers who assist us in our business and who are only permitted to use your information in ways we have authorized or to comply with legal requirements. These trusted parties include:
Our subsidiaries and affiliates;
Trusted business partners, such as companies we partner with for joint projects or promotions, and service providers, to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us;
When reasonably requested or required by law enforcement authorities or other government officials;
When required by law or in response to legal process;
When we believe disclosure is appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss;
When reasonably necessary to an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
As necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of the Sites’ Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; and
We may also disclose your personal information with your express consent.
Please note that if you voluntarily submit any personal information for posting on the Sites, such as a review or a blog post, the information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others, so you should use care before posting information about yourself online.
Your Choices
We offer you certain choices about the information we collect, how we use and share information, and how we communicate with you. To help protect your privacy, when you exercise these choices we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password.
By contacting us as shown in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy, you may opt-out of receiving communications from us, such as newsletters and surveys. You also have the following specific opt-out choices:
Marketing communications. You may opt-out of specific communications (such as marketing emails, rewards program emails, and customer satisfaction surveys) by following the opt-out instructions contained in the footer of each communication or contacting Customer Service as provided below. In certain jurisdictions, we will market to you only with your express consent.
Cookies. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, rejecting cookies may affect your user experience, and you may not be able to access or use certain features of our Sites. In addition, disabling cookies may invalidate opt-outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt-outs. Because Peet’s does not own or control browser tools, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness.
Mobile devices and geographic location. When you use our website on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your location with us by adjusting the device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your plan provider or device manufacturer. For more information on opting out on mobile devices, you may also visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.

Access, Correction, & Deletion
We respect your right to access and correct your personal information. You may access your personal information by signing into your account. From there, you can correct or modify your information. You may also exercise your rights, subject to applicable laws, to request that we delete or restrict access to your personal data. We may need to retain it for legally permitted purposes and this will be explained to you if necessary.
If you need assistance correcting or updating your personal information, or would like to request that we delete your personal information, please contact us using the contact information detailed in the “Contact Us” section below.
Retention of Personal Information
We retain personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so. Our retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we will refer to the following criteria in order to determine retention period:
Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.
Whether the data is necessary to provide our products, services or programs.
Whether our visitors have the ability to access and delete the data within their accounts.
Whether our visitors would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until their Peet’s Coffee accounts are closed or terminated.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible..
Children’s Privacy
Peet’s Sites are not directed at children under the age of 13 and Peet’s does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If Peet’s learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to us without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and/or to not use such information for any purpose (except as necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personal information we have collected from a child under 13, please contact us.

If you are visiting the Sites from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country.

Do Not Track Disclosure
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Peet’s does not recognize DNT. For more information regarding your choices regarding tracking, see the “Your Choices” section, above.
Information Security
The nature of our business requires us to collect and maintain certain personal information, and we understand that we have a responsibility to protect it. To do so, we maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to safeguard your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Your Peet’s account is protected by your log-in credentials, which you must keep secure and confidential. We also use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications protocol in many areas of the site where we ask users to submit information.
We communicate our privacy and security guidelines and standards to Peet’s employees who access personal information for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and we enforce these requirements within the company. We also require that our service providers protect your personal information and use it only in the ways we have authorized.
Peet’s endeavors to maintain accurate information and provide you with options to update your information. You can log into your account and modify your information using your log-in credentials. You also may request that we update your information by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy.
