You must, however, register and provide personally identifiable information in order to access certain portions or use some or all of the features of certain Peavey Electronics Properties, receive Peavey Electronics communications, and to enter contests and other promotions.
Peavey Electronics may use content you provide us through emails, responses to polls, contests or sweepstakes or any other promotional activity. Please be advised that your submissions become the property of Peavey Electronics and may be used by Peavey Electronics for marketing emails, targeted advertising on social media, or internal user analysis. You grant Peavey Electronics permission to use the content of your submission in marketing whether now known or invented in the future, with or without attribution, including publication online, trade media, and advertising into perpetuity without limitation. You agree that any content you send us will not violate any rights of any third-party and that you will only send us content for which you own the rights.
B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Peavey Electronics also collects other information that is not personally identifiable to you, but results solely from your visit to Peavey Electronics Properties. We use web beacons, cookies, and a Facebook pixel, which are placed on your computer when you access Peavey Electronics Properties.
a. IP Addresses
Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. By collecting your IP address, Peavey Electronics’s server records the referring page that linked you to the Peavey Electronics Property (e.g., another website or a search engine). If you’re coming from another website, then the pages you visit on this website, the website you visit after this website, the ads you see or click on, other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using, any search terms you have entered on the Peavey Electronics Property or a referral website, and other usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Peavey Electronics may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic and geographic information, and administer our Peavey Electronics Properties. Peavey Electronics may also link this information with your personally identifiable information when Peavey Electronics feels that it is necessary to enforce compliance with its rules and policies, terms of service, or to protect its Peavey Electronics Properties, customers or others.
b. Web Beacons
Web beacons are Internet tools, such as transparent images on a website or in e-mails that we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, the number of visitors to a Peavey Electronics Property, whether a page has been viewed or an e-mail opened, or to collect other related information, and this information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or IP address. For example, when you ask us to send you information on a promotion or newsletter, we may use web beacons to determine how many of the e-mails we sent were actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad, can contain a web beacon.

When you use Peavey Electronics Properties, we may place one or more cookies on your computer or other electronic device.

6. SECURITY
Peavey Electronics limits third party access such as Mailchimp and Facebook to personally identifiable information collected on Peavey Electronics Properties. Peavey Electronics Properties have security measures in place that we believe are reasonable to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Peavey Electronics’s control. While Peavey Electronics cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, Peavey Electronics uses industry standards, such as Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) technology, to help safeguard against such occurrences. In certain instances, the information passed between your browser or device and the Peavey Electronics system is encrypted with SSL technology to create a protected connection between you and Peavey Electronics Properties to ensure confidentiality. In the event that a breach into the Peavey Electronics security systems occurs and there is a possibility that an unauthorized person acquired your personal information, Peavey Electronics will notify you of the breach under applicable law. No transmission of information via the Internet can be entirely secure, however, so please always use caution when submitting personal information.
7. ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you wish to have access to your personally identifiable information, please contact us with your request at the address below. You may also request that Peavey Electronics update your personal information or correct any factual errors that you believe may exist regarding this information. In the event of a change in control of Peavey Electronics or sale by Peavey Electronics of substantially all of its assets, any information owned by or in the control of Peavey Electronics may be transferred to such Peavey Electronics successor, who will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
8. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
Peavey Electronics Properties are not linked to other websites or applications not maintained by or related to Peavey Electronics.
