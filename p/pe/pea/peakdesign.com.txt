WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT & RETAIN?
ORDER FULFILLMENT INFORMATION
When you purchase products through our website, we collect your name and shipping address, as well as phone number and email address. All of these pieces of information are necessary to ship your order. We do not share any of your contact information with anybody other than our third party order fulfillment vendors. We retain your shipping details and order history to enable us to provide you with future customer services like returns and warranty replacements. If you create a peakdesign.com account we store your account password, which you can reset or change at any time. Your password is only accessible by you and never by Peak Design employees or third parties.
CREDIT CARD PROCESSING
Peak Design does not collect or store credit card information provided when making a purchase on our website. All credit card transactions are handled by our third party payment gateways and merchant services.
WEBSITE ANALYTICS
We use Google Analytics to track the volume and type of traffic that comes to our website. When you access this website Google may collect information such as cookies, IP address, search keywords, session length, browser type, page views and number of visits. None of this information is personally identifiable, and is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of our Google Analytics by opting out in your Ads Control Panel or in the global ad network privacy. You can also install the Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on in your browser.
DIGITAL MARKETING & RETARGETING
We use a few different digital marketing services to create and display online ads for our products. As you browse peakdesign.com, these services use cookies to remember what products you viewed and clicked on. Our advertising partners then enable us us to present you with advertising based on your previous interaction with peakdesign.com. You might see Peak Design ads on other websites, on Facebook and Instagram, or while watching videos on Youtube or other platforms. This practice is called “retargeting.” We don’t collect any personally identifiable information about you (like name or email) until you make a purchase. We also don’t directly retain your digital marketing information—instead, that data is retained by our third party marketing services. You can opt out of having your data retained by these services here.
CART ABANDONMENT EMAILS
We work with a third party cart abandonment marketing service. After you've added products to your cart and started the checkout process, we allow that service to collect some of the information that you type into those checkout fields. They collect and retain your email address and what was in your cart. They do not collect any of your payment information. The information collected is used to send an automated email if you do not complete the checkout process. This email contains a link for you to contact us in case there is anything we can help you with. You can opt out of having your data collected and retained by our cart abandonment service here.
CUSTOMER SUPPORT
We use a third party service to host and manage our Support Center and Contact Us form. When you fill out the Contact Us form or email info@peakdesign.com, our support service retains all of the information you provided, including your name and email. This information enables our support team to see a history of your support inquiries and provide you with the best possible service. Your customer service history is only accessible by the Peak Design Customer Service team.
PEAK DESIGN NEWSLETTER
If you sign up or opt in to the Peak Design Newsletter we will collect your name and email address for the purposes of sending you occasional updates about our company. We will never share or sell this information to anybody without your consent, and you can unsubscribe at any time.
WEBSITE A/B TESTING
We’re always trying to make our website a better experience for customers. To do this, we use third party tools to run A/B tests. During an A/B test, we split our website visitors into 2 groups and show each group a different page design. We then analytical tools to determine which group of customers was best able to accomplish their goals on our site. The winning page design is then implemented for 100% of website visitors. Our A/B testing and analytical tools do not collect or retain personally identifiable information. Instead, they collect and retain pages you visit on our website, things you click on, mouse movements, and how far down you scroll. You can opt out of having your data collected and retained by these services here.
How does Google Analytics work?
Google Analytics is Google’s web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how their visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics collects information anonymously, and much like examining footprints in sand, it reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. The cookie is used to store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. A different cookie is used for each website, and visitors are not tracked across multiple sites. Analytics requires that all websites that use it must update their privacy policy to include a notice that fully discloses the use of Analytics. To disable this type of cookie, some browsers will indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis. In addition to declining cookies, you can also install the Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on in your browser, which prevents Google Analytics from collecting information about your website visits.
HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
Peak Design takes security seriously and cares about the integrity of your personal information. We use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological methods to transmit and store your data in a secure, encrypted manner. However, Peak Design cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
