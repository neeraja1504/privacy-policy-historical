QUESTIONS
If you have questions, please contact your Privacy Officer.
Use and Disclosure of Your Health Information
The following categories describe different ways we use and disclose health information. Not every
use or disclosure in a category will be listed. Generally, except as allowed by law, we restrict access
to your information, including nonpublic financial information, to those workforce members who need
to know that information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your
information.
Use and Disclosure of Your Health Information for Treatment, Payment
and Operations:
Treatment: We may use and disclose your health information to give you care and to coordinate
and manage your treatment or other services. For example, we also may disclose your health
information to other health care providers who are not employed by PeaceHealth who are seeing you
in his or her office.
Payment: We may use and disclose your health information to bill and collect payment from you or
your health plan for services you received. For example, we may give information about your surgery
to your health plan so your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment.
Health Care Operations: We may use and disclose your health information for our operations.
For example, our quality improvement teams may use your health information to assess the care and
outcomes in your case and others like it.
Uses and Disclosures That We May Make Unless You Object:
Directory: Unless you object, the PeaceHealth inpatient/acute care directory may list certain limited
information about you, including your name, location in a facility, and your general condition (fair,
stable, etc.). Directory information may be disclosed to people who ask for you by name and to
members of the clergy, whether or not they ask for you by name. This is so family, friends and clergy
may visit you and generally know how you are doing. If you wish to opt out of the directory, please
notify the Admitting or Patient Registration Department. If you opt out, then we will not tell callers or
visitors that you are a patient, and we may return letters and deliveries (such as flowers) addressed
to you at PeaceHealth.
Individuals Involved in Your Care or for Notification: We may disclose to a family member,
close personal friend, or other person you identify certain health information that is needed for that
person’s involvement in your care or payment for your care. Except in limited situations, such as an
emergency, we will ask you or determine if you object. We may use professional judgment and
experience when allowing a person to pick up prescriptions, medical supplies, x-rays, or other similar
health information on your behalf. We also may disclose your health information, directly or through a
disaster relief entity, to find and tell those close to you of your location or condition.
Uses and Disclosures We May Make Without Your Authorization:
As Required by Law: We will disclose your health information when required to do so by federal,
state or local law.

Fundraising: We may use, or disclose to a foundation related to PeaceHealth or to a business
associate, limited health information about you to raise money for PeaceHealth. They may tell you
about PeaceHealth as well as sending you fundraising materials. The fundraising materials will tell
you how to opt-out of receiving future materials.
Business Associates: We may disclose your health information to “business associates” with which
we contract to perform services on our behalf.
Public Health Activities: We may disclose your health information for public health activities,
including: to a public health authority authorized by law to collect information to prevent or control
disease, injury, or disability; to report actual or suspected child abuse or neglect; for certain federal
Food and Drug Administration activities; to a person who may have been exposed to a
communicable disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition, as
authorized by law; and to an employer about an employee, in certain situations.
Victims of Abuse, Neglect, or Domestic Violence: As allowed or required by law, we may
disclose health information about an individual we reasonably believe to be the victim of abuse,
neglect, or domestic violence to a government authority authorized to receive such reports.
Health Oversight: We may disclose your health information to a health oversight agency for
activities authorized by law, such as audits, investigations, inspections and licensure.
Lawsuits and Disputes: We may disclose your health information in response to a court or
administrative order, subpoena, discovery request or other lawful process, as allowed or required by
law.
Law Enforcement Activities: We may disclose your health information if asked to do so by a law
enforcement official: as required by laws that mandate certain types of reporting; in response to court
orders, subpoenas, warrants, summons, grand jury subpoenas, certain administrative requests, or
similar processes; to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person (but we
will give only limited information); about the victim of a crime in certain circumstances; about a death
we believe may be the result of criminal conduct; about criminal conduct on our premises; and, in
emergencies, to report a crime, the location of the crime or victims, or the identity, description, or
location of the person who committed the crime.
Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors: We may disclose your health
information to a medical examiner or coroner as necessary or required to identify a deceased person
or determine the cause of death. We also may disclose your health information to funeral directors so
they can perform their duties.
Organ and Tissue Donations: We may disclose health information to authorized organizations
as required or needed for organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplants.
Research: Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose your health information for
research purposes. Most of the time, the provider conducting the research or PeaceHealth will ask
for your authorization.
To Avert a Serious or Imminent Threat to Health or Safety: We may use and disclose your
health information when we reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent a serious or imminent
threat to the health and safety of you, the public or another person. The disclosure would only be to
someone who is likely to help prevent the threat such as law enforcement.

similar programs.

National Security, Intelligence Activities, Protective Services and Military Personnel:
We may disclose your health information to authorized federal officials for intelligence,
counterintelligence, special investigations, and other national security activities authorized by law or
to protect the President or other authorized persons. If you are a member of the armed forces, we
may disclose health information about you as required by your military command authorities.
Inmates: We may disclose health information about an individual who is an inmate or is in custody
to a correctional institution or law enforcement official.
Organized Health Care Arrangement: Solely for purposes of complying with federal privacy
laws, PeaceHealth and its medical staffs characterize themselves as an “organized health care
arrangement” and have agreed to follow this Notice for services by, at or through PeaceHealth.
These providers may share health information with each other for treatment, payment, and the health
care operations of the organized health care arrangement and as described in this Notice.
PeaceHealth is not responsible for actions by independent medical staff members.
Affiliated Covered Entities: We may share health information with providers who are “affiliated
covered entities” of PeaceHealth. These are entities with which PeaceHealth has common ownership
or control.
Incidental Disclosures: Certain incidental disclosures of your health information may occur as a
by-product of permitted uses and disclosures. For example, a roommate may inadvertently overhear
a discussion about your care if you share a room.
De-identified Information and Limited Data Sets: We may use and disclose your health
information that has been “de-identified” by removing certain identifiers (such as name and address)
making it unlikely that you could be identified. We also may disclose limited health information,
contained in a “limited data set,” as allowed by law.
Personal Representatives: Minors and incapacitated adults may have “personal representatives.”
These personal representatives may be able to act on the individual’s behalf and exercise the
individual’s privacy rights.
Uses and Disclosures We May Make with Authorization:
Your Authorization: Other uses and disclosures of your health information not covered by this
Notice or permitted by law will be made only with your written authorization. These types of uses and
disclosures include psychotherapy notes, or uses or disclosures for the purposes of marketing or for
the sale of your health information. You may revoke your authorization, in writing, at any time,
(unless you are told otherwise at the time you sign the authorization). If you revoke your
authorization, then we will no longer use or disclose your health information for the reasons covered
by your authorization, except to the extent that we already have relied on your authorization. We are
unable to take back any disclosures we already have made based on your authorization, and we are
required to retain our records of the care that we provided to you.
Specially Protected Health Information: Unless otherwise required or permitted by law, we
may need your authorization to disclose your health information regarding treatment for
AIDS/HIV/ARC, mental health, drug addiction, alcoholism, and other substance abuse treatment,
developmental disabilities, and/or genetic information or records.
