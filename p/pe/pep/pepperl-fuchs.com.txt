Data protection information regarding use of the Pepperl+Fuchs website
For the purpose of pursuing our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our website in line with article 6, paragraph 1, clause F of the GDPR), we use a number of different methods to analyze your usage patterns. All methods have in common that data will only be collected, processed, and used in an anonymous or pseudonymous manner. While anonymous data is impossible to match with a specific person, pseudonymous data could theoretically be matched to you personally with some effort. Regardless of this, no procedure will assign any data to a specific person or combine that data with other data held by Pepperl+Fuchs without your explicit consent. More detailed information on the analytical services we employ and your options for revoking consent for them can be found below:
