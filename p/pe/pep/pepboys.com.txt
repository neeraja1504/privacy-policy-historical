Customer Care Policies | Privacy Policy| Pep Boys
Pep Boys is serious about the privacy and security of the information with which you entrust us. This privacy statement explains how we use any information collected from you if you browse our Web site, shop at our online store or retail or service locations (“Locations”) or participate in our contests. We may change this policy so we recommend that you review the terms periodically. Your continued use of our Locations constitutes acceptance of the revisions. If you are a member of our Rewards or Varsity programs, please see the applicable program documents for additional information that may apply. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected with respect to our Pep Boys branded credit cards. If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, please contact us at contactus@pepboys.com or call 1-800-PEP-BOYS (737-2697).
Registration: In order to get the most out of our Web site, guests are encouraged to first complete a Pep Boys online account registration form. During registration, a visitor is required to provide his or her contact information, such as name and e-mail address, shipping and billing information if placing an order, and vehicle information. This information is used to create a personal account for the visitor and to contact the online account holder regarding Pep Boys' products and services. Pep Boys online account holders receive updates via e-mail or text messages regarding the status of their orders, as they flow through the delivery process or the status of their vehicle during the service process. If you choose to check out as a guest the information you enter will be used for the purposes of that order, but will not be saved on our Web site and you will have to re-enter it every time you use guest checkout.
Order: We request information from the guest on our online order form and at our Locations when providing services. A guest must provide contact information, such as name, shipping and billing address and e-mail address and for billing purposes, financial information, such as credit/charge card number, expiration date and card verification code. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the guest. We may also use your phone number to identify your order and/or return in our system or on the return mailing label. You may create an online account during the ordering process, but you are not required to do so. We communicate with the guest to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.
Security: We want our guests to feel confident when they use our Web site and trust us with their personal information. We take every commercially reasonable precaution to protect our guests’ personal information both online and offline. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information provided to us and guests do so at their own risk.
Guests may choose to create a user name and password in order to complete the Pep Boys online registration process, or make an appointment or purchase. Please keep this information confidential.
When our registration/order form asks guests to enter sensitive information, such as credit/charge card number, that information is encrypted using standards-based Web technologies called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). While on a secure, encrypted page, such as our checkout pages, the padlock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari will change from unlocked to locked.
If you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us at contactus@pepboys.com or call 1-800-PEP-BOYS (737-2697).

For example, we use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and one or more processing companies to collect credit card information and bill guests for goods and services, and to monitor for fraud. We also partner with other third-parties to provide specific services. For example, our Web site is hosted by a third–party, so it may also receive certain information about you. We may share names, credit card information or other personally identifiable information that is necessary for the third party to provide those services. We do not authorize those third-parties or shipping companies to use personally identifiable information, except for the purpose of providing services to us.

We may share your information with our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates or in the event of a corporate merger, acquisition, sale, dissolution or similar event. If we believe we are required by a valid law, rule, regulation or court order to share information about our guests, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the safety or rights of Pep Boys, its associates, customers or third parties, we may do so. We may share non-personal information about your vehicle's service history with our partners.
