Privacy Policy | PeopleVerified.com
Welcome to PeopleVerified.com, a website designed to help you find information available in public records. This privacy policy is for visitors (“you”) of PeopleVerified.com (the “service” or “the site”), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. (“we” or “our”).
This policy discusses what information these sites collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances we may share it in.
What is covered by this privacy policy?
PeopleVerified.com is a tool designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others. This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Visit GoodHire.com for all your employment screening needs.
What isn’t covered by this privacy policy?
This privacy policy only applies to information collected by this website, which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. This policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains you visit because you click a link on this site, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.
If you want to submit an opt-out request to remove yourself from the search results of this and other people search sites we operate, please click here. We will try our best to honor it.
If you choose to opt out of search results, that choice will affect the visibility of the relevant information on our entire network of sites, which includes this website, Peoplesmart.com, Identity.com, and other affiliated properties. We try our best to honor your request, but our opt-out system is not perfect and it may miss records that don’t perfectly match the information you submit.
Your Public Records Exist Elsewhere In The World – We Do Not Control Them
This site displays public records that are available in the real world, such as criminal history records from law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy records from courts. Original copies of public records can only be changed by those entities. Inflection obtains its public records through third party sources. Please note that exercising the opt-out option will not actually delete or change the original copies of such records.
Note: If you consent to the release of your information via another Inflection product (e.g., a background report on GoodHire.com), your public records will be shared for the purpose you specify.
Your safety and privacy are very important to us
We want to minimize the risk of harm resulting from the use of public records information. Please contact us if you are particularly at risk for certain types of harm as a result of your public records being available on this site. Inflection will work with you on mitigating the risk any potential harm, including physical harm, threats to public officials such as law enforcement, and issues related to identity theft. Please send your request to our Privacy Department at privacy@peoplesmart.com along with appropriate documentation.
We Collect Information Necessary for Payments and Other Products
If you choose to purchase a report or subscription on this site, your purchase will be made through PeopleSmart.com and covered under its privacy policy, available here. PeopleSmart.com is owned by our parent company, Inflection.com, Inc.
When you make a purchase, PeopleSmart.com may collect information to complete it and prevent fraud, which may include your credit card information, name, email address, and physical address. For processing payments, PeopleSmart uses systems that are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). All payment and transaction-related information is safely stored according to PCI DSS requirements.
Information We Collect From All Visitors

Activity Information
When you visit this site, we collect information about which pages you visit, who what you search for, and the products you buy.
Information collected by cookies and in the background
This site makes use of tools such as cookies to collect various types of information about your activity and computer while your use the website. We only use information collected in the background to deliver and market our services — information collected by cookies and other tools is not used to augment our search results.
Content and preference cookies. We use different types of cookies (both temporary and persistent) to make it easier for you to help you navigate the site, track usage of our site to improve your experience, and remember your preferences. Disabling cookies may limit your ability to use some areas of our site.
Technical and analytics data. We use services such as Google Analytics to learn about how people discover, use, and interact with the site.
Advertising information. We use third party advertisers to show you ads for Inflection products on other websites. Showing you these ads involves placement of a cookie on your computer. If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices for opting out, please visit the Google opt out page to opt-out of Google cookies, or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt out system. We do not control the cookies and/or trackers used by the third-party resources and links provided on this site. However, we can provide visibility into the cookies and trackers used when you follow links or paths from this site to our partner site, PeopleSmart.com. For a closer look into the third-party advertising and tracking cookies involved, you can consult the About Our Cookies page on PeopleSmart.com. This privacy resource provides useful information and options for opting out of these cookies.
How We Use The Information We Collect
Your information is only used to provide and market this service to you, which includes operating the website, conducting in-house research, preventing fraud or abuse, marketing you products or services offered by us, and to communicate with you and address your concerns.
We Only Share Your Information in the Following Situations
With Your Consent: We may share your information when you give us permission.
With Our Parent Company: Inflection.com, Inc. owns a variety of services in addition to this site, including Identity.com, PeopleSmart.com, GoodHire.com, and other people search sites. Data collected under this privacy policy is shared with Inflection and stored alongside data from those other services. Your choices on one service may affect another service – for instance, opting out on PeopleSmart.com may mean that your records will not be available on Identity.com.
With Service Providers: We use certain trusted third parties to provide services for us such as payments processing. We only share the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the service. In addition, any third-party service provider we use is required to give your information the same protections that are outlined here in this Privacy Policy.
Deidentified and Aggregated Data: We may share or disclose information we collect after deidentifying and aggregating it so it cannot be linked back to an individual person. We contractually require third parties to respect this practice.
Business Transfers: In the event that Inflection is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. However, the new entity will be bound by this privacy policy after the sale or transfer.
Legal Process and Emergency Circumstances: We may disclose or preserve for future disclosure your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect Inflection’s rights or property or to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process, or to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
If you are a law enforcement officer seeking information from Inflection about one of our users, please reference our Law Enforcement Guidelines for further information.
Unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will do our best to provide subjects of law enforcement requests with advance notice before we disclose their information to law enforcement, if we have contact information for that person. We reserve the right to withhold advance notice where it would impede an investigation of identity theft, or in situations involving imminent physical harm or harm to minors.
How We Retain And Protect Your Information
We retain all of the information we collect or that you submit for purposes including fraud prevention, legal compliance, and to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. If you choose to opt out of public record searches, we retain that information in order to limit the future search visibility of records relating to you on our websites.
Your information is stored on secure servers in Northern California. While we use acceptable industry-standard practices to protect your information, we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will be absolutely secure.
Fraud and Abuse Prevention
We partner with certain third party vendors to prevent fraud and abuse. To do this, we may use information that includes your IP address, browser, and operating systems to identify suspected fraudulent activity and block it.
