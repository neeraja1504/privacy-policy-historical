Information We Collect
We may collect certain personal information on our own behalf on the Sites as described in this Privacy Policy.

A visitor to our Sites who is not seeking employment and not expressing an interest in purchasing products or services from us, is not required to reveal any personal information such as name, address or telephone number, provided that the Cookie section below does in such case apply. A visitor of our Sites who is seeking direct employment with us will be required to include certain personal information, including CV or resume, date of birth, name and contact details. In processing such data we use our own PeopleFluent Recruitment Management System, which is managed and accessible by our human resources team and subject to stringent security measures.

We use such data only as authorized in our subscription agreements with such customers and in accordance with applicable law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security of their own user logins. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service and that we believe offer a secure solution that improves our service delivery.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies
In maintaining and administering our Sites, PeopleFluent and our marketing partners, affiliates, and/or PeopleFluent-authorized service providers use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends, track users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We also use cookies similar to the cookies listed below as part of our application systems to our customers to enhance and enable service levels and service delivery.
A cookie is a small data file placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires when you end your session (i.e. close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on your hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A "web beacon" is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image, a redirect URL or JavaScript and is used in conjunction with a cookie.
Our Sites, application services and related marketing emails may use session and persistent cookies. The cookies placed by our server are readable only by us, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on your computer. We may use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of our Sites and interaction with emails from us. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to our Sites, in order to improve our Sites and email communications.
Our Sites may contain links to other websites including share and/or "like" buttons. These other websites, services and applications may set their own cookies on users’ computers, collect data or solicit personal information. You should refer to their privacy policies to understand how your information may be collected and/or used by them.
Preference Cookies:
We use preference cookies to collect information about your choices and preferences on our Sites and application services, and to allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize our Sites and application services accordingly.
Analytical Cookies:
We also use analytics cookies to collect information about your use of our Sites and our application services, and to enable us to improve the way our Sites work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our Sites and application services, help us record any difficulties you have with our Sites and application services, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on our Sites and application services, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information.
Marketing Cookies:
We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the internet.
We, and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our Sites. Remarketing cookies used by us expire after 30 days. To opt out of Remarketing or to control your ad preferences, please click here and follow the guidance provided by Google.
Controlling Cookies:
Most web browsers have a "help" menu where you can review how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have your browser alert you when you receive a new cookie or how to fully disable cookies on your browser. You can learn more about cookies at sites like www.aboutcookies.org. If you use your browser settings to block all cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of our Sites.

Where we store your personal data and how long for
Our Sites are hosted on servers located in the United Kingdom, and our applications are being hosted in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Support for our Sites is being provided by Leo Learning Limited, Leo Learning Inc. and PeopleFluent staff based in the United Kingdom, the United States and Hong Kong. Support for our applications is being provided by PeopleFluent affiliates in the United Kingdom, the United States, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Any personal information that we collect from you through the Sites for our marketing purposes is input directly into our Salesforce database, which is hosted and supported in the EEA, and our Pardot and Marketo databases, which are hosted and supported in the US. For data subjects based in the European Economic Area (EEA), this means that the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored outside the EEA. It may also be accessed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us. We have put in place lawful transfer mechanisms allowing for transfers of personal data outside the EEA, in accordance with applicable EU data protection legislation.
We may keep records of any personal information obtained from you on or through our Sites, or otherwise, for as long as we believe is reasonably required, or such longer period as may be required for legal, audit and compliance purposes. This does not affect your right to opt out from receiving marketing communications, as outlined above and in the section “Your Rights” below. We also keep records of any personal information processed by us through our application services in accordance with our relevant agreement in place with our customers.
Security
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we have adopted appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information collected by and/or submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Information maintained by us is protected by computer security mechanisms that may include firewalls, encryption, monitoring software, data and network segmentation, and passwords. When you enter your credit card number and your login information through our Sites, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and any transmission and supply of personal information to us is therefore at your own risk. If you have any questions about our security practices, you can email us at Data.Privacy@PeopleFluent.com.
Disclosure of your information
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We may disclose your personal information as necessary or appropriate in connection with any of the purposes for which we use personal information (as outlined below), including to subcontractors or service providers that help host or support the relevant sites or application services, or otherwise provide technical assistance to us.
We may also use third party service providers to provide credit card processing on our Sites, as outlined above. Transfers to subsequent third parties as part of our application services are covered by the service agreements with our customers. We do reserve the right to disclose personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of our business. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law and or in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, bankruptcy or similar legal process. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional or other purposes. If this practice should change in the future we will update this policy to identify those third parties and indicate how individuals can opt out of non-agent data sharing.
In addition, we may disclose your personal information to any member of the Learning Technologies Group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, provided however that we shall remain responsible for the treatment of such group members of your personal information in accordance with this policy. We may also share your personal data with any of our authorized local resellers, where we in our reasonable opinion believe that our relevant local reseller will be better placed to provide you with suitable PeopleFluent offerings, as outlined above. Where we share your personal data with such local partner, such local partner may contact you directly with PeopleFluent related offerings, to which you consent by acceptance of these terms, and in such case such local partner shall act as a data controller and direct marketer in relation to you.
Where we use third party service providers as outlined above, we choose parties which we believe offer a secure service and help us enhance our services or practices, and follow any legal requirements that may apply.
