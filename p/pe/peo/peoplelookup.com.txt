PeopleLookup.com Privacy Policy
Effective January 15, 2016
PeopleLookup.com respects your right to privacy and we are committed to protecting it. This policy discloses our information practices, including what type of personal information we gather and track, how we use this personal information, with whom we share the personal information, the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information, and how you can access and update this information. Please keep in mind that this Policy applies to all PeopleLookup.com brands, products and services that do not have a separate privacy policy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact us at privacy@peoplelookup.com.
Personal Information
In general, you can visit us without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name and address, phone number or e-mail address so we may correspond with you, process an order, or provide you with a subscription or service. You may give us your credit card details to buy a product or service from us, or provide us a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at PeopleLookup.com for which you wish to be considered. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you of how we will use your information, before you provide it. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information in this manner or to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or associate, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.
How to Remove your Information from the PeopleLookup.com Public Records Databases
Public records are available from the official public records custodian or repository to anyone who requests them. In addition to public records, personal information may be publicly or commercially available. Publicly available information consists of online and offline information that is generally available but is not maintained by a government agency, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals and businesses, professional licensing and trade organization information, press releases and newspaper articles and content from blogs or social networking sites. Commercial records consist of information that is maintained by enterprises and is available for purchase, such as marketing and telemarketing lists, phone connect and disconnect information, and business profile data.
As a courtesy we enable you to opt out your personal information from our databases. What this means is that your name as it appears in a particular record and the associated identifying information such as your address and phone number will be suppressed if you request this in the manner described below. However, please note that any time your identifying information appears in a public record or in a publicly or commercially available manner, in a way that is different from the particular record you opted out, it may again appear in our databases. For example, if your address or area code changes, your new information -- including other associated identifying information may again appear unless you opt out the new record. Similarly, if the way in which your name or address appears in a record differs from a record you opted out (e.g., "Michael" instead of "Mike," or "1212 Second AVE NE" instead of "1212-2nd Avenue Northeast"), we may include the differing record. Please also note that there may be more than one record in our databases associated with your personal information. Opting out one particular record will not opt out other record(s). An opt-out will apply from processing date forward; any report purchased prior to your opt-out will still be available to the purchaser thereof in accordance with the terms of our service. In addition to PeopleLookup.com, there are many other companies offering public records search services, and your request that we opt out your information from our databases will not prevent your information from appearing on these other services.
You can submit an opt-out request via fax or postal mail. Regardless of which method you choose, in order for us to suppress your personal information from appearing in our databases, we need to verify your identity. To do this, we need proof of identity, consisting of either:
a copy of a government-issued ID with any photo or ID number crossed out. Examples: driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. military ID card, state-issued ID card, or employee ID card from a state agency, or
a notarized Identity Verification Form
We will only use this information to process your opt out request.
In addition to your proof of identity, please include the following so we can accurately identify your records:
Name
Date of Birth
Address
Here is the contact information for submitting your request:
Fax | (425) 974-6194
---|---
Mail | P.O. Box 4145
Bellevue, WA 98009-4145
Your information will be removed from our database in approximately 7-14 days. Opt-out requests must be submitted to us individually by the subject of a particular record. Bulk opt-out requests will not be fulfilled.
How we Use and Share Personal Information
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how we may use the personal information you provide to us and with whom we may share it.
Fulfilling your Transaction Request. If you request something from us, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request.

Data Retention and Disclosures Required By Law
