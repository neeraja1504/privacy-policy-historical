If you have logged in using Facebook then we will show your Facebook profile picture next to your name in the signatures page and we link from your name to your Facebook profile page.
After you sign a petition, we send a message to your email address to make sure that the email address is valid and belongs to you.

How is this information shared?
The author of a petition will receive the information you provide in the signature form when you sign her/his petition.
We might need to share some information with a police to prevent or solve a crime. Normally we ask a police to contact Finnish Police because our company is located in Finland.
How do you keep my information safe?
We use Security Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt all the data before it travels over the internet.
We store your information on secure computers or at data centers. Only authorized personnel can access the information on these computers.
Our servers are located in France and our head office is located in Finland.
Passwords are not saved in clear text. We calculate hash sums of the passwords and use salts.
How can I view, edit and remove my information?
To manage petitions you have created, then log in using the email address you used when you created the petition.
You can manage your signatures through page "Manage signatures". If you have signed a petition without providing an email address or your email doesn't anymore work, then contact the author of the petition or send us a message using our contact form.
To access other information, please send us a message using our contact form. Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected or your information removed completely.
