At Peter Glenn, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use information about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Peter Glenn over the Internet without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you.
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet, we or our business partners may use it to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription to our mailing list. It is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
We have implemented these practices for the Peter Glenn website and also continually instruct all of our employees and business partners to honor your privacy with the utmost confidentiality.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
When you sign up on our mailing list page, we need only an e-mail address. We use this to send you news about the store and special promotions.
In the future we may personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about the apparel you wear and other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage such as clicks, hits and at time which other domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics to help us develop future design layouts and features of the store. Once this information has been analyzed, we discard it.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality change to the Web site, new Peter Glenn services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access using a combination of firewalls, system authorization and the security of industry-leading relational databases such as SQL Server and Oracle.
