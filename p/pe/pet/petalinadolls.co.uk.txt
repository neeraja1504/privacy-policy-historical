Privacy Policy - Petalina
When you complete an order with Petalina, your name, address, telephone number and email address will only be used for the purpose of processing and delivering your order to you. We may contact you by email or telephone should there be a problem with the stock you have selected. Your details may also be passed onto Interlink Express or other businesses involved in delivery. However, your details will NOT be passed onto any other business for marketing purposes.
Your name, address and telephone number, as part of your order information, are held on a secure server managed by 2Dmedia. 2Dmedia are the business that Petalina has chosen to build, host and support our website. Petalina therefore has a record of all your purchases, which can be very useful when trying to remember which doll you purchased and therefore which dolls clothes to buy!
Your email address will be used to send you details of any promotions, sales and new products from time to time, but only if you sign up to receive our newsletter. Again, your email address will not be passed onto anyone else.

Facebook don't have a way of removing yourself from all advertising because it is the income from advertising that keeps Facebook free of charge.
