The Data Sources of the Collected Data
The collected data is either received directly from the user or determined from the data given by the user. The exact data sources of the collected data are described in the following sections.
The Data Collected by the petrikainulainen.net Website
This section describes the data that is collected by the petrikainulainen.net website. If you want take a look at a specific subsection of this section, you can use the following links:
Access Log
Blocked IP Addresses
Comments
Live Traffic
Login Attempts
Opt-In Forms
Access Log
We use the Apache HTTP server that logs all requests processed by the server. These requests are written to a so called access log. The access log contains the following data:
The timestamp of the HTTP request
The IP address of the client
The value of the User-Agent HTTP request header
The value of the Referer HTTP request header
The requested resource
The request method
The used HTTP protocol
The returned HTTP status code
The size of the returned HTTP response
The collected data is extracted mainly from the incoming HTTP request. Also, before the Apache HTTP server returns the response to the client, it will extract the returned HTTP status code and the size of the returned response, and write this information to the access log.
We collect this data because we have a legitimate interest to prevent abuse.
We store old access logs for one month.
Blocked IP Addresses
The Wordfence WordPress plugin provides additional protection for the petrikainulainen.net website. This plugin identifies malicious traffic and blocks IP addresses that send this traffic to this website. We can also block IP addresses manually by creating so called block rules.
A block rule contains the following information:
The IP address
The country of the IP address
A reason that explains why the IP address is blocked
The creation time of the rule
The expiration time of the rule
The timestamp of the last request send to this website
This data is extracted from the malicious HTTP request or given manually by an administrator. The country of the IP address is determined by using an IP location finder.
We collect this data because have a legitimate interest to prevent abuse.
If the block rule is created automatically by Wordfence, it is stored for five days (120 hours). If the block rule is created manually, it will be stored indefinitely.
Because this website is basically a blog, readers can leave comments to blog posts published on this site.
A comment contains the following information:
The IP address of the reader
The name or alias of the reader.
The comment text.
This data is given by the reader when he/she submits the comment form, and we use this data for helping our readers to solve their problems. In other words, we collect this data because we have a legitimate interest to make our website as useful as possible.
All comments are stored indefinitely.
Live Traffic
The Wordfence WordPress plugin provides additional protection for the petrikainulainen.net website. This plugin has a firewall that keeps track of the HTTP requests send to this website and blocks malicious HTTP requests.
Wordfence collects the following information:
The timestamp of the HTTP address
The IP address of the client
The host name of the IP address
The geolocation of the IP address (city and country)
The value of the User-Agent HTTP request header
The type of the HTTP request (human, bot, warning, blocked)
The requested resource
The returned HTTP status code
This data is extracted mainly from the incoming HTTP request. The city and country of the IP address are determined by using an IP location finder. Also, the returned HTTP status code is extracted from the returned HTTP response.
We collect this data because we have a legitimate interest to identify and block malicious traffic.
This data is stored for one week.
Login Attempts

Wordfence collects the following data:
Timestamp
The IP address of the client
Username
A boolean which is true if the user is an existing user and false otherwise.
The outcome of the login attempt (success, failed).
This data is extracted mainly from the HTTP request which is send to the petrikainulainen.net website when a user submits the login form. The outcome of the login attempt and the boolean flag (existing user) is determined from the result of the login attempt.
We collect this data because we have a legitimate interest to prevent abuse.
We store this data for three months.
Opt-In Forms
We have implemented our opt-in forms by using the Thrive Leads WordPress plugin. This plugin gathers statistics about the conversation rates of our opt-in forms and stores the email address of every person who subscribes our email newsletter.
Thrive Leads collects the following data when the user submits an opt-in form.
Timestamp
Email address
The lead group / short code which displayed the opt-in form
The type of the opt-in form
The referrer URL
The email address is given by the reader of our website when he/she subscribes our email newsletter. The lead group / short code and the type of the opt-in form is determined by Thrive Leads. The referrer URL is extracted from the incoming HTTP request.
We collect this data because we have a legal obligation (Article 7 of EU GDPR) to prove that a person has given us his/her consent to send email to him/her.
This data is stored as long as the subscriber has confirmed his/her subscription by clicking the opt-in link found from the confirmation email. However, because it would take too much time to delete this information one row at the time, we clear the content of this database table once a week.
Regular Transfer of Data
This section identifies the information that is transferred to third parties. If you want take a look at a specific subsection of this section, you can use the following links:
Attack Data
Tracking and Analytics
Email List
Attack Data
The Wordfence WordPress plugin provides additional protection for the petrikainulainen.net website. This plugin has a firewall that keeps track of the HTTP requests send to this website and blocks malicious HTTP requests. When the HTTP request contains malicious activity or suspicious behavior (such as a failed login), Wordfence sends the following data to Defiant (the company behind Wordfence):
The IP address of client
The request time of the HTTP request
The referrer (when available)
The browser user-agent string
The metadata stored on the device (such as other HTTP headers that might indicate preferred language)
Defiant extracts the following information from the collected data:
The IP address of the client
The location of the client
The search queries done by the client
The date and time of the HTTP request
The referral URL
The device make
The device model
The device OS
The mobile network info
The ISP used by the client
The browser type
The preferred language
We transfer this data to Defiant because we have a legitimate interest to identify and block malicious traffic, and Wordfence helps us to do it.
Typically the collected data is deleted after 90 days because it is no longer needed. However, if the IP address continues to be involved in malicious activity, it might be added to the Defiant’s blacklist. If this happens, the data will kept as long as the IP address will be kept on the blacklist.
Tracking and Analytics
This section identifies the information that is collected by third parties which we use to gather information from the users of this website. Before we describe the data that is collected by our analytics partner, we will identify three things which we don’t do:
We don’t use Facebook advertising and we don’t load the Facebook tracking pixel.
We don’t use the advertising features of Google Analytics. In other words, we don’t see the demographics and interest reports.
We don’t use Google AdWords.
Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics for gathering information from the anonymous users of this website. The tracking script of Google Analytics is run on every page load. Google Analytics identifies the user by using cookies and the gathered information is send to Google’s servers which can be located in the United States. Google will use this information for providing us different reports from our visitors. These reports are used to compile visitor statistics and improve our service.
By the way, we honor the Do Not Track (DNT) header. If a visitor of this website signals that he/she doesn’t want to be tracked, this website doesn’t load the Google Analytics tracking script.
Google Analytics tracks the incoming traffic and collects information from the website usage. It also gathers data about the user’s computer / mobile device. The collected information information include:
The anonymized IP address (not shown on the UI)
The cookie(s) which identifies the user
The requested page
The used browser
The used operating system
The used mobile device
The used internet service provider
The screen resolution of the computer / mobile device
The requested page
The referrer of the request
The Google Analytics campaign parameters
Events. We use events for measuring the conversion rate of our landing pages.
The landing page / exit page
The demographics and interest information of the user. Google can gather this information if the user has visited other websites which belong to the Google Display Network. The gathered data is anonymized and Google doesn’t gather data about actual website visits or individual visitors.
This information is either extracted from the incoming HTTP request or determined from it.
We use this data for two purposes:
It helps us to measure the effectiveness of our content marketing efforts.
It helps us to identify topics which are useful to our readers. This means that Google Analytics helps us to provide useful content to our readers.
In other words, we collect this data because we have a legitimate interest to measure the effectiveness of our content marketing efforts and provide useful content to our readers.
This information is stored indefinitely.

Email List
We have an email list that allows us to keep in touch with the regular readers of this blog. We use an email marketing tool called Drip for this purpose.
Drip collects the following data:
The email address of the subscriber.
The time zone of the subscriber.
The method that was used to subscribe the newsletter.
The tags which are used to segment subscribers to different groups. For example, when a user subscribes our email newsletter he/she can specify what kind of emails he/she want to get it. These email preferences are saved by using tags. Also, if the person has purchased my Test With Spring course, he/she will have tags which identify him/her as a person who has purchased this course.
A list of emails send to the subscriber.
A list of emails which were opened by the subscriber.
A list of emails which contained a link that was clicked by the subscriber.
A list of trigger links clicked by the subscriber.
A list of subscribed email campaigns.
Notes about the customer.
Drip collects its data by using these data sources:
The subscriber. The email address and email preferences (tags) are provided by the subscriber. Also, when a subscriber opens our email or clicks a link found from our email, Drip updates the open and click statistics of the email in question.
Drip. A list of emails send to the student is updated by Drip when we send a new email to the subscribers of our newsletter.
An administrator. When a person subscribes our newsletter and he/she has purchased my Test With Spring course, an administrator will add to the correct tags to the subscriber.
We use the collected data for four different purposes:
First , we send useful content to our subscribers. This means that every time when we publish a new blog post, we send an email to our subscribers.
Second , we send relevant marketing emails to our subscribers. These emails market either our own products or the products of our business partners.
Third , we segment our subscribers to different groups because this allows us to send relevant information to our subscribers. For example, if the subscriber has told us that he/she wants to get only testing related information, we won’t send him/her an email when we release a blog post that doesn’t talk about testing.
Fourth , we use the open and click rates for improving our communication. We want to provide useful information to our readers and these two statistics help us to achieve this goal.
We collect this data because the subscriber has given us his/her consent to do so. When a person subscribes our email newsletter, he/she has to confirm his/her subscription by clicking the confirm link found from the confirmation email.
This data is stored as long as the subscriber is subscribed to the newsletter. When a subscriber cancels his/her subscription, we store this data for 30 days before it is deleted permanently.
