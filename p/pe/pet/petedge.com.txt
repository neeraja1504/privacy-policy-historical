Security
PetEdge.com guarantees your security. Every time an order is placed or account information is accessed, it is done through a secure server that encrypts all information.
Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access and use at all times. The secure server software we utilize incorporates a state-of-the-art security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is used to encode all information, including credit card numbers, passwords, names, etc. This highly secure encryption makes it virtually impossible for anyone to ever see your information.
Trust is vital to e-commerce. To confidently communicate and transact business on the Internet, businesses and individuals must be able to identify who they are dealing with, and assure themselves that information exchanged online is safe from interception and alteration. In order to achieve this level of security, PetEdge.com also employs the use of digital certificates. Our Certificate Authority, VeriSign Inc., helps to establish the trust needed to make e-commerce work for every transaction, every communication, every time.
