The Petro-Points section of the Petro-Canada Web site uses session cookies to enable us to better serve Petro-Points members. You must enable cookies for this section of the Web site to function correctly. Petro-Canada does not use cookies to track any personal information about you, nor to collect any marketing data.

|  Automatic Logging of Session Data
To help us serve you better, we continuously and automatically collect generic, non-personal information about visits to our Web site. The following points describe the nature of the information collected in our Web server logs:
We do not collect personal information such as names, ages, phone numbers, addresses or e-mail addresses from visitors to our Web site. We do not collect individual profile information for visitors across multiple sites and do not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites.
We collect anonymous visitor information like IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet Explorer or Netscape), return visits from past guests, referring pages, pages visited along with the order in which they were visited, time spent on the Web site, and the referrer and transaction information for e-commerce pages. We collect such non-personally identifiable information for the following purposes: (1) to obtain anonymous statistical analysis of Web page traffic patterns for our Web site (2) to administer our Web site and servers, (3) to allow for auditing of our services by third parties, and (4) to improve our services.
As mentioned above, we use cookies only for more accurate anonymous traffic analysis As we do not build a database of individual visitors, the data that we do collect is never stored in any individual user profile; the data collected serves only to update aggregate counts allowing us to monitor traffic on our Web site.
We make use of customized JavaScript tracking code to track anonymous information about visitors' activity. This code contacts our suppliers’ servers, receives a cookie in response, and loads an image to the page. This 1 x 1 image is called a clear gif or Web bug. This JavaScript tracking code does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number, mailing address or credit card numbers from visitors to our Web site. Visitors may elect to opt out of receiving tracking cookies used to collect information for our Web server logs. Note: the opt out option requires one cookie to function.
We do not create individual profiles of visitors. We do not have a database of individual profiles of each visitor. We collect data in aggregate form and data is not recorded or stored about individual visitors.
We may use the aggregate data to inform third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their Web sites.
Petro-Canada reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
