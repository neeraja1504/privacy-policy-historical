Privacy Policy Effective February 12, 2009
Your privacy and security are our top concerns. We understand how valuable your personal information is to you, and we assure you that it is just as valuable to us. We will never share your information with anyone else without your prior consent. From time to time, we may market certain third party services through our site. Should you choose to accept an offer from a third party, we will pass your relevant personal information, including your name, postal address, credit/debit card number and any other required billing information to that specific third party.
Security
Protecting the information you give us is our greatest priority. Your personal data is protected against unauthorized use. You do not have to worry about the security of your credit card information. We protect your online order information using the most up to date Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
Communications Preferences
From time to time, PetCareRx may contact you with special offers and discounts, and information we think may be of interest to you and your pets. You can manage your email and mailing preferences in the ‘My Account’ section of our website. We let you decide if you want to hear from us. Click here to access your communications preferences. Notwithstanding that you may have previously opted out, if you subsequently accept a third party’s marketing offer on our Site, we will share your contact information (and your billing information) with that specific third party.
