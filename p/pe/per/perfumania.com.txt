EU Citizens Only:   Our Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
We respect and safeguard the data privacy rights of all of our website visitors and customers.  The European Union (“EU”) has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which requires additional protections for the Personal Information of EU citizens.  The definition of Personal Information for EU citizens is broader than the definition set forth in this Privacy Policy – it can also include IP addresses, responses to surveys, social media identifiers and photographs posted to social media.  EU citizens also enjoy additional protections under the GDPR.  For this reason, we have amended our Privacy Policy as it applies to EU citizens, effective May 25, 2018.  Below we set forth how we are satisfying the GDPR requirements for our EU citizen users.
1. Rights of EU Citizens under GDPR
Under the GDPR, EU citizens have the right to request the following information from us:
-What Personal Information we hold about you, and for what purpose.
-Access to the Personal Information we hold about you.
-The right to correct Personal Information we hold about you.
-The right to withdraw consent for any use of your Personal Information by us.
-The right to object to any use of your Personal Information by us.
-The right to have your Personal Information deleted from our database.
-The right to ask for Personal Information to be transferred either back to you or to another data controller.
Any GDPR request must be made sending an email to dataprivacy@perfumania.com.   ** **
2.  Transparency of Personal Information
We only share your Personal Information with our business partners for the lawful purpose of digital marketing, and we ensure any third parties receiving your Personal Information comply with the requirements of the GDPR.  If you provide us with social media details, we may obtain publicly available information about you from these social media platforms.  We will obtain consent from you for any uses of your Personal Information that fall outside the purpose described in this Privacy Policy.  We do not collect sensitive information about you.
3.  Retention of Personal Information
Your Personal Information will be retained by us for no longer than is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or as if required by law.  When your Personal Information is deleted, it shall be deleted across all of our platforms and no longer shared with our business partners.
Changes to the Privacy Policy?
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.  However, we will not use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than promised at the time it was collected without your consent.  To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.
