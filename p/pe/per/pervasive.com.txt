Actian shares customer information across Actian-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf, but only as described above in “How we use your information.” For instance, if you download an evaluation product, we may share your information with an authorized Actian reseller in your territory. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

Actian contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers such as credit card processing companies, marketing campaign management companies, SaaS software providers, email service providers or third party customer service companies to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described in “How we use your information.” Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Actian and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Actian. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. In certain situations, Actian may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Actian will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, subpoena, or local law, or in our sole discretion, to law enforcement agencies to assist in any investigation, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or unlawful conduct or respond to a government request.
Certain Actian services are linked with those from unrelated third-party companies, some of which offer you the option to share with both Actian and the third party personal data you provide. Examples include the ability to register software products from multiple vendors from a single Actian Web page, to request communications from Actian marketing or solution partners, or to enable order completion through a reseller.
Actian or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired, including some or all of your personal information. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
