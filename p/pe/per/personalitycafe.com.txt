We may also share a hashed or encrypted version of your email address or telephone number with advertising partners so that you may be served with tailored advertising on our websites or other third party websites. These advertising partners are not permitted to use your hashed or encrypted email address for any other purpose.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.
