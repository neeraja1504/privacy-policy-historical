HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
To Provide Products, Services, and Information
As described above, we collect information from you so that we can offer, sell and ship products to you and to provide you with information and support that you request from us. We use your information to register and service your online account, process orders for products, process payments, and fulfill your orders. We use your Personal Data to contact you about your orders and requests. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may use your information to send newsletters, advertisements, or other promotional communications about our Site, products, and services. We may also administer surveys, sweepstakes, promotions, and contests using your information. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us maintain, fulfill, and deliver our Site and our products and services. We may use your information to notify you about changes to our Site or any products or services we offer or provide though them. In addition, we may use your information in any other way we may describe when you provide the information, for any purpose in which you provide it, and for any other purpose with your consent.
We may use third parties (including our subsidiaries and affiliates) to help host our Site; operate our online catalog, store and shopping experience; send out email updates about the Site; provide marketing and advertising services for us; remove repetitive information from our user lists; and provide and administer the Site, our products, and our services. These third party service providers will have access to your Personal Data in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. We use demographic information to better understand our customers, and improve our products and services.
Advertising
We may use information we collect from you (through our Site or through third party service providers) about how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for Pelican’s products and services. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by Pelican. If you wish to consent to such use, you can check the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your Personal Data or otherwise seek such consent. If you wish to change your choice, you may do so at any time by logging into the Site and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to communication@pelican.com.
You can learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on its website (www.networkadvertising.org) and from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance on its website (www.aboutads.info). We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the NAI on its website.
We belong to ad networks or use marketing companies that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to see ads on our Site, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.
Our Site does not respond to “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish us to collect information about your online activity or receive interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (www.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org).

In addition to sharing for reasons as described elsewhere in this Policy, we will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of the Pelican when we have your consent to do so.
Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm

Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Pelican, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your Personal Data to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.
ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Data you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with control over your Personal Data:
Reviewing Your Personal Data. You can review and change your Personal Data by logging into the Site and visiting your “My Account” page.

We may also not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising. We will only share your Personal Data with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for promotional purposes with your express consent. If you wish to consent to such use, you can check the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your Personal Data or otherwise seek such consent.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
In order to help protect your Personal Data, access to your data on our Site is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as a social security number) is protected by encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and our Site. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Site are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
