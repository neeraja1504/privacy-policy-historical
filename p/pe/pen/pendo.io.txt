PRIVACY SHIELD
Pendo complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (Privacy Shield) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland, as applicable to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. Pendo has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Pendo remains responsible for any of your Personal Data that is shared under the onward transfer principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the “DOES PENDO SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?” section below.
In compliance with the Principles, Pendo commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. If you are a resident of the European Union or Switzerland with inquiries or complaints regarding your personal data within the scope of Privacy Shield, you should contact Pendo’s Data Protection/Compliance Officer at gdpr@pendo.io. Under Privacy Shield, organizations must respond to individuals within 45 days of receiving a complaint. Pendo will endeavor to respond to your inquiry promptly.
If we are unable to resolve any complaint related to Privacy Shield or if we fail to acknowledge your complaint in a timely fashion you may refer a complaint to your local data protection authority. Pendo has committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU or Switzerland. We will work with them to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to you. In certain circumstances, Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Principles.
Pendo’s Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. We may be required to disclose Personal Data that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We collect the following types of information:
A. Personal Data You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

In order to provide the Service to you, you must provide us with a unique identifier for each of Your Customers. We encourage you to use a unique identifier that does not include Your Customers’ Personal Data; however, your information with respect to the Service will consist of any information, including any of Your Customers’ Personal Data, you choose to provide to us.

DOES PENDO SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We share customer information only as described below:
A. Third-Party Service Providers: We provide personal information to a limited number of third-party providers (“Providers”) to process it for us or to perform functions on our behalf, based on our instructions, and pursuant to the Onward Transfer Principle of Privacy Shield. Our Providers perform their services for us in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We enter into contracts with our Providers which limit data processing to processing only for specified purposes and require our Providers to provide the same level of confidentiality protection as Pendo. We may have liability under Privacy Shield if both (i) the provider processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
B. Third-Party Business Partners: Pendo partners with a variety of businesses and works closely with them to market or sell products or services (“Partners”). We may disclose Personal Data to our Partners for the purposes described above. Some of our Partners may co-sponsor events and other offerings with Pendo. We may share Personal Data you provide to us when you sign up for events or other offering with these Partners so they can send you marketing communications and information that may interest you, as permitted under applicable law. You will be notified, prior to sharing any Personal Data, that the event for which you are signing up is co-sponsored and that our Partner may use the information shared to communicate with you or market to you. At such time, you may elect not to provide your Personal Data to us or to our Partner for such purposes.

Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.
D. Legal Reasons: We may share Personal Data outside of Pendo if reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process or enforceable governmental requests; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Pendo, our customers, or the public as permitted by law.
E. With Consent: Pendo does not sell your information and will not use customer data for any reason beyond those described in this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.
WHERE DOES PENDO STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Data submitted to Pendo and Pendo’s application are hosted and stored in a secure, multi-tenant environment provided by Google’s Cloud Platform.
