**Privacy Policy
Gisele and T respect each individual's right to personal privacy. We collect and use information through our site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.
We collect no personal information about primary visitors. We do collect e-mail addresses and other voluntarily divulged information from forum users and donors. We do not release this information to anyone, keep it in password-protected databases and use it only to offer donors free giveaways and to contact forum users about the site or forum.
We do not actively market to children, and we never knowingly ask a child under 13 to divulge personal information.
We collect general, non-personal data via Google Analytics, eXtreme Tracker, Project Wonderful and other sources about visitor numbers, pageviews, referring sites, IP locations, and bounce rates to track our progress, sell advertising more effectively and better understand our audience. The information we collect is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with third parties.
We employ cookies only on our forums. A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on a user's computer hard drive to be a unique identifier. Our cookies collect IP addresses we can use to identify and, if necessary, ban forum members. Please be advised that information posted on forums becomes public knowledge.
We offer links to other Web sites. When you click on links to other Web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.
If our policy on information collection or uses changes, we will advise you by e-mail where possible.
