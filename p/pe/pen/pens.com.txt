Privacy Policy - National Pen
National Pen respects your privacy
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
What information does National Pen collect?
If you choose to use our services, we require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms on our site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password only once during a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you cannot log in and cannot place orders on our site.
Security
We keep the information you give us secure using "Secure Socket Layers" ("SSL"), an industry standard encryption technology. SSL encrypts all ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be read in transit.
As required by law under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card issuer must limit your liability to $50 in the extremely rare case of confirmed credit card fraud. When you place an order on pens.com, a Federally Insured and Accredited Banking Institution manages the credit card processing.
