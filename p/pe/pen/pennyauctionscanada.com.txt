However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information within our corporate family and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law.

When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share personal information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: fulfilling online orders, processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have provided to us, delivering products, and providing customer support services. Penny Auctions Canada has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our Web Site.

To learn more about Phishing and email fraud, please read below:
Learn about E-mail Fraud
Phishing (also referred to as brand spoofing) is a type of scheme that uses fraudulent e-mail and web pages to gather personal, financial and sensitive information for the purpose of identity theft. Most commonly, users receive spam e-mail (mass e-mail messaging) and pop-up windows that appear to come from legitimate businesses. People have been tricked by these deceptive solicitations into sharing passwords and credit card, social security and bank account numbers. As an online user, you should always continue to take precautions including querying the origination of e-mails, the URLs that those e-mails purport to take you to, and paying close attention to the secure padlock icon on your Internet Browser. Additionally, you should always navigate the web using authentic Internet security software. The ONLY time Penny Auctions Canada collects your credit card information is when you are making an online purchase on our secure web site. If you think you were the recipient of a phishing e-mail where you provided some information, please contact your credit card company immediately to determine what recourse you have available to you. Penny Auctions Canada is committed to protecting and ensuring your personal information remains private. If you have any questions for Penny Auctions Canada, please contact us at privacy@pennyauctionscanada.com.
