SALE OF BUSINESS ASSETS
In the unlikely event of a sale of HITACHI, a HITACHI business unit, or a HITACHI affiliate, personal information held by HITACHI may be made available to a buyer or prospective buyers in order for them to evaluate any such purchase or to operate any parts of HITACHI's business.
MODIFICATIONS
Subject to the legal requirements of your jurisdiction of residence for notice and consent, HITACHI reserves the right to modify or amend this Policy at any time in order to adjust to applicable laws or regulations, or changes in HITACHI's practices or procedures. Where conflicts exist between the terms and conditions of this Policy and applicable national data protection laws, the latter will take precedence. This Policy is not intended to, and does not, provide rights beyond those that are prescribed by applicable national laws. The implementation date will be displayed at the bottom of this Policy.
HITACHI CONTENT PLATFORM ANYWHERE ANDROID APPLICATION
Hitachi Content Platform (hereinafter, "HCP") Anywhere is deployed by enterprises to mobilize, manage, and protect data. The data on the HCP Anywhere mobile application is stored and managed by the particular enterprise that deployed the HCP Anywhere sever, not HITACHI. In these cases, any data subjects who wish to exercise their rights should direct their query to our customers who act as "Data Controllers".
When installed on a device, the HCP Anywhere mobile application has access to several permissions which allows it to enforce security policies on the device based on the enterprise's HCP Anywhere settings. Mainly, the application can enforce:
Password requirements, such as length and alphanumeric requirements
Maximum inactivity time
Storage area encryption
The HCP Anywhere mobile application enforces these policies using Device Administration. Although the HCP Anywhere mobile application can enforce certain policies on the device, it does not collect or process any personal information (e.g. Your device password).

Please let us know if a person under the age of thirteen has provided HITACHI with personal information by contacting privacy@hitachivantara.com.
