Use of any information gathered from or about our customers through the Penske internet websites (the "Sites") shall be governed by the Sites' Terms of Use (www.pensketruckrental.com/terms-and-conditions/) and this Privacy Policy. Penske encourages you to read this Privacy Policy in full to learn how Penske treats personal information obtained while visiting our Sites, and we encourage you to check back regularly for any updates. Use of the Sites indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Sites' Terms of Use, and Penske's use of your information as described below.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, or our Sites, please contact a Penske representative at 1-888-234-4201 or via email at privacy@penske.com, or via mail to Chief Compliance Officer, Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., 2675 Morgantown Road, Reading, PA 19607.
Collection of personal information
We collect personal information in various ways to better serve you. Such information may be used to allow you to order or schedule services, to receive support for the services we provide, to allow us to contact you to provide those services, to complete delivery of products and services, and to protect Penske from fraudulent transactions. We also use the information we collect to tailor and improve your experience while using the Sites.
Once you access the Sites and/or transact business with Penske, we may collect personally identifiable information about you. Such personally identifiable information may include e-mail addresses, domain names, addresses and routing information; your name and phone number; your mailing and/or billing addresses; and other relevant data that will better allow us to provide information and/or services related to your needs. We may also receive information from consumer credit reporting agencies, credit references, employers and insurance agencies such as your credit history, credit worthiness, and information obtained to verify employment history or current insurance coverage. We collect information from cookies (see below) and other technology to track your website usage with us and to provide you with customized content, among other things. Penske will not rent or sell your name, address, credit card information, or other personal information to any third party.
Collection of aggregate information
In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, we also collect aggregate information from many users about use of the Sites, such as number of visits and pages visited, and the overall duration of time spent on the Sites. The information we collect depends in large part upon the needs of your account and what services and features you use on the Sites. We do not disclose this information to third parties.
Cookie and tracking technology
When you enter information or otherwise navigate through the Sites, the Sites use temporary "cookies" or other tracking methods to recognize you and your access privileges on the Sites, to facilitate the interaction between you and the Sites, and to track Site usage. A "cookie" is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser for storage by your hard drive that allows us to provide you with tailored information and services by recognizing your hard drive when you return to the Sites. If you choose to do so, you may opt out of the use of cookies through your browser's options. If you refuse cookies, you may find that some services do not function properly or may be considerably slower.
Advertising/online tracking
Penske uses online advertising programs (including but not limited to Google Adwords Remarketing) to serve ads on third-party websites. These programs use cookies and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of ads for their clients, and to display relevant ads tailored to you based on your visit to our Sites.
You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from many websites by using the opt-out tools available through the Digital Advertising Alliance (www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org) or the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org). You can opt out of Google AdWords Remarketing by visiting Google's Ads Preferences Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads).
Security
The security of customer information is very important to us, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard non-public personal information about you.
When our credit pre-approval form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as social security numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with 128-bit or greater SSL encryption software, an industry standard for reputable organizations. While on a secure page, such as our credit pre-approval application form, the website address will begin with https://...
Furthermore, once the information has been received by us, we use security procedures and policies commensurate with industry standards to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and/or disclosure.
Right to monitor use
Penske reserves the right, without any obligation, to monitor your use of the Sites for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Sites' Terms of Use (www.pensketruckrental.com/terms-and-conditions/). Penske further reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communications, or content that it deems in its discretion to be harmful, abusive, offensive or hateful to Penske, its affiliates, or to any of Penske's customers and/or users of the Sites, or that may otherwise violate the law.

Business Transfers: In the event that Penske sells or transfers all or a portion of our business and assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with that transaction. In such event, Penske will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains protected.
How we protect personal information
