We recognize the utmost importance of the need to protect the personal information of children. For this reason, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old. Features on our sites which may collect personal information are age-gated so they are not available to children under 13 years old. If we do collect personal information from a child under 13 years old, we may maintain that information only as long as it is reasonably necessary as required by law, or to fulfill a request with parental consent. If we discover we possess information from a child under 13 in a manner inconsistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act's requirements, or other relevant laws, we will seek to delete the information immediately.

Despite all efforts, however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill any requests, and will strive to dispose of all personal information in a secure manner when the information is no longer reasonably necessary.

We operate globally and may transfer your personal information among Absolute, its parent company, or third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

When we materially change this privacy policy, we will provide notice to you, where required by applicable law. Your continued use of the product or service, including use of any company website, after the effective date of the change will constitute acceptance of the change. We may provide such notice by email, by posting the notice on our sites, or by other means consistent with applicable law.
