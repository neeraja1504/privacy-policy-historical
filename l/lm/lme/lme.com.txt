When we transfer your data to organisations outside the HKEX group (e.g. suppliers) we may use these clauses.

Your Rights
****You have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide in a structured, machine readable format.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement). Where we have asked for your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time. If you ask to withdraw your consent to us processing your data, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.
You can object at any time to our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, by contacting us using the information below.
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country in which you live or work, or alternatively to the UK Information Commissioner (www.ico.org.uk).
Retention
We retain records related to actual or prospective: members, members’ clients, ISVs, warehouse operators, logistics firms, vendors, market data distributors, purchasers of market data and other products and services we provide, and any other key stakeholders, for an indefinite period of time, where such records are pertinent for the LME to ensure the orderly functioning of its markets.
Personal data relating to investment decision makers of our members' clients will be retained for as long as the relevant client is registered to use our services.
Where we process personal data for marketing and client relationship management purposes or with your consent, and you remain an active user of our websites or services, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future. Where you cease to be an active user of our websites or services, we will retain your data used for marketing and client relationship management purposes for a period of two years from your last interaction with us.
