Cookies and Clear Gifs.
What Are Cookies? A cookie is a string of information that a Web site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Web site each time the visitor returns. Most major websites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to “recognize” a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in Meridian cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with Meridian and, on rare occasion, its third-party service provider.
What Are Clear GIFs? Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. Any information gathered from Clear GIFs is strictly for Meridian Magazine’s use and only helps determine how we can better serve our readers.

Meridian visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Meridian, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to any of Meridian’s Web sites.
