Hydreon Corporation, owner of the Lifeboat Network, takes your privacy very seriously. We live by the Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto to you.” We want our private information kept private, therefore, we promise to keep your information private and used only for it’s intended purpose.
SECTION 1 – Introduction
Thank you for choosing to play and use the Lifeboat Network games, website, and other services. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the type of information we collect or receive and how we use it. When you use our games, access our website and other services, or make a purchase, you agree to our use of your data as laid out in this privacy policy.
SECTION 2 – What personal data we collect or receive and why we collect it
We collect, store, and use your personal information only when necessary. All personal information is kept for only as long as it is necessary to provide the services you use or request. The following are places where we may collect your information.
IN-GAME
Since all registration, sign in, and purchases are done with your Xbox Live account, we store a very limited amount of information. For privacy information relating to the Minecraft Game, MineCoins, and Xbox Live please refer to the Microsoft Privacy Policy.
When you play on our servers, we collect your Xboc Live username and, if there is one available, the Lifeboat username, Rank, and purchases made so you may play on our servers.
When you make a purchase on the Lifeboat Store in the Minecraft App using Minecoins we are given your username so we may add the appropriate purchase.
If you win an in-game contest, e.g. Treasure Hunt, we collect your username so you may enter it into our website to claim the prize.
If you previously registered an account on our server network–prior to Xbox Live usage–the only personal information that was required and collected was your username and email address. We still retain this information so that we may give you access to past purchases. We periodically remove inactive accounts.
WEBSITE
When you purchase a physical product from our website, or purchase part of the buying and selling process, e.g. international shipping for a free item, we collect the personal information you give us such as your username, name, physical address, credit card information, and email address. We use this information to bill the credit card, ship the item to the address given, and keep you updated on the status of the order.
If you enter and win a contest for a physical item, e.g. Treasure Hunt, Twitter contest, etc., we collect the personal information you give us such as your username, name, physical address, and email address. We use this information to ship the item to the address you provide and keep you updated on the status of the order.
When you browse our website, we automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address to help us learn about your browser and operating system. This allows us to give you the best browsing experience.
Only with your permission may we send you emails about our website, new products, community information, and other updates. We will never send you unsolicited updates unless it pertains to a security issue that may affect your personal information.
Support Form: When you enter your information into the Lifeboat Support Form, we ask for your Xbox Gamertag and email address. We only use this information to respond, if necessary, with an answer, or ask additional questions, to your query. We do not keep the original nor any follow-up emails. The information provided is for customer support only, we do not use it for marketing purposes.
SECTION 3 – Consent
By browsing our website, playing our games, making purchases, creating an account, participating in our discord server, or contacting us for support, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for shipment, or any other way you provide us this information, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific purpose only.
If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no when you first give us your information.
If, after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at privacy@lbsg.net or emailing us at: Hydreon Corporation 6440 Flying Cloud Dr Suite 100, Eden Prairie, MN, 55344, United States.
SECTION 4 – Disclosure
We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so. Otherwise, we do not disclose your information to another party deemed unnecessary to provide the service in which you initially provided us the information.
SECTION 5 – Third-Party Services
Third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary that allows them to perform the services they provide to us.
However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. This is includes Microsoft, Ultracart (our shopping cart software for physical purchases), and Quickbooks Merchant Services (our credit card payment processor)
For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy, though the information we have retained from you is still subject to this policy.
