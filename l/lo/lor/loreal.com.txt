PROFILING
When we send or display personalised communications or content, we may use some techniques qualified as “profiling” (i.e. any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of using those data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s personal preferences, interests, economic situation, behaviour, location, health, reliability, or movements). This means that we may collect personal data about you in the different scenarios mentioned in the table above. We centralize this data and analyse it to evaluate and predict your personal preferences and/or interests.
Based on our analysis, we send or display communications and/or content tailored to your interests/needs.
You have the right to object to the use of your data for “profiling” in certain circumstances. Please see “Your Rights and Choices” section below.
WHO MAY ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
The persons having access to your personal data are authorized employees within the competent departments of L'Oréal S.A. and its affiliates.
Your personal data may also be processed on our behalf by our trusted third party providers.
We rely on trusted third parties to perform a range of business operations on our behalf. We only provide them with the information they need to perform the service, and we require that they do not use your personal data for any other purpose. We always use our best efforts to ensure that all third parties we work with keep your personal data secure. For instance, we may entrust services that require the processing of your personal data to:
Third parties that assist and help us in providing IT services, such as platform providers, hosting services, maintenance and support on our databases as well as on our software and applications that may contain data about you (such services could sometimes imply access to your data to perform the required tasks);
Third parties that perform on our behalf our satisfaction surveys and the statistical analyses associated with the use of the website.
We may also disclose your personal data to third parties :
In the event that we sell any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer of such business or assets. If L’Oréal or a part of its assets is acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers relating to those assets is one of the transferred assets. Where appropriate, in such case, the buyer acting as the new data controller processes your data and its privacy policy governs the processing of your personal data.
If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use/sales or other terms and conditions you have agreed to; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of L’Oréal, our customers, or employees.
If we have your consent to do so
Or if we are permitted to do so by law.
We do not offer or sell your personal data.
WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
The data we collect from you is stored in France by L'Oréal or its trusted service providers.
However, said data may, at any moment, be transferred to, accessed from, and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff members operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers.
L’Oréal transfers personal data outside of the EEA only in a secure and lawful way. As some countries may not have laws governing the use and transfer of personal data, we take steps to make sure that third parties adhere to the commitments set out in this Policy. These steps may include reviewing third parties’ privacy and security standards and/or entering into appropriate contracts (based on the template adopted by the EU Commission).
For further information, please contact us as per the “Contact” section below.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose for which we hold your personal data, to meet your needs, or to comply with our legal obligations. To determine the data retention period of your data, we use the following criteria:
Where cookies are placed on your computer, we keep them for as long as necessary to achieve their purposes (e.g. for the duration of a session for session ID cookies) and for a period defined in accordance with local regulations and guidance.
If you contact us as part of an enquiry, we keep your personal data for as long as necessary to process your enquiry.
We may retain some personal data to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, as well as to allow us to manage our rights (for example to assert our claims in Courts) or for statistical or historical purposes.
When we no longer need to use your personal data, it is removed from our systems and records or anonymised so that you can no longer be identified from it.
IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE?
We are committed to keeping your personal data secure, and taking all reasonable precautions to do so. We contractually require that trusted third parties who handle your personal data for us do the same.
We always do our best to protect your personal data and once we have received your personal data, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. As the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site. As such, any transmission is at your own risk.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES AND SOCIAL LOGIN

SOCIAL MEDIA AND USER GENERATED CONTENT
Some of our websites allow users to submit their own content.
