WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?
“Personal data” means any information or pieces of information that could identify you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly (e.g. through pseudonymised data, such as a unique ID number). This means that personal data includes things like email/home addresses, usernames, profile pictures, personal preferences and shopping habits, user generated content, financial information, and health information. It could also include unique numerical identifiers like your computer’s IP address or your mobile device’s MAC address, as well as cookies.
This Privacy Policy covers all personal data about you that is collected and used by L'Oréal.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?
You, the consumer, are our priority. You drive what we do. We love hearing from you, learning about you, and creating and delivering products that you enjoy. We know that many of you love interacting with us and because of this, there are many ways that you might share your personal data with us, and ways that we might collect it.
How do we collect or receive your personal data?
We might collect or receive personal data from you via our websites, forms, apps, devices, L’Oréal products or brand pages on social media or otherwise. Sometimes you give this to us directly (e.g. when you create an account, when you contact us, when you purchase from our websites or stores), sometimes we collect it (e.g. using cookies to understand how you use our websites) or sometimes we receive your personal data from other third parties, including other L’Oréal Group entities.
In the table below, we explain:
In what context is your personal data collected? This column explains what activity or scenario you are involved in when we use or collect your personal data. For example, whether you are making a purchase, signing up to a newsletter, or browsing a website.
What personal data may we hold about you? This column explains what types of personal data we may collect when you take part in a particular activity.
How and why we use it? This column explains what we do with your personal data, and the purposes for collecting and using it.
What is our legal basis for using your personal data? Whenever we use your personal data, we will have a legal basis to do this. For example, you have asked us to provide a service, you have given us your consent, or we have a legitimate interest in using your personal data.
The legal basis for the processing of your personal data can be:
Your consent – This applies where you provide your personal data and specifically consent to us using it to provide you with a specific service, for example, so that:
you can receive marketing communications from us. If you later ask us to stop sending you marketing communications, we need to keep some of your personal data on a suppression list so that we can make sure we do not contact you again. This is a legal obligation; and
we can store certain cookies on your device. We may place targeted advertising cookies (these allow us to tailor services we offer, specifically to you), analytical cookies (these measure your interaction with our site so we can make improvements) on your device.
The performance of a contract – This applies where you provide us with your personal data in order for us to provide you with a service (e.g. you ask us to create a customer account for you or you wish to purchase a product and we can manage the associated logistics).
Our legitimate interests –This applies where you provide us with your personal data and we use it to: **  **
improve our products and services. By providing us with your personal data, we are able to better understand your needs and expectations when it comes to the products and services we offer. This understanding means we can improve our products and services so they match your needs. This might involve performing analytics on how you use our products, services, and websites/apps/devices, or trying out new functions which we think you might like based on what we know about you.
better engage with you. Where you provide us with your personal data, we may use it to encourage you to be more actively engaged with our products and brands and increase your overall brand engagement and awareness. One way we do this is by tailoring the marketing communications we send you so that you receive the information most relevant to you.
prevent fraud. Where you provide us with your personal data, it means we can action any payment you make when you purchase any of our products and/or services, and importantly, check that your payment is free from fraud.
secure our tools : We may use your personal data to keep our tools (websites/apps/devices) safe and secure. This involves making sure our tools are working properly, and that your personal data is kept secure.
To comply with a legal obligation – This is where you provide us with your personal data which we need to keep for our legal reasons (e.g. when you make a purchase we need to keep your transaction information to comply with our tax and financial reporting obligations).
To protect the vital interests of an individual – This is where we use your personal data to protect you (or someone else) where there is evidence of danger to your (or someone else’s) health and/or safety.
The table below sets out which legal basis we rely on when processing your personal data for each context.
When we collect personal data, we will indicate which types of personal data are mandatory via asterisks. Some of the personal data we request from you are either necessary for us to:
Perform our contract with you (e.g. to deliver the goods you have purchased on our websites/apps);
Provide you with a service you have asked for (e.g. to provide you with a newsletter);
Comply with legal requirements (e.g. invoicing).
If you do not provide the personal data marked with an asterisk, this may affect the goods and services that we can provide.

Automated Decision Making
Automated decision making means the ability to make decisions using technology, without human involvement.
We may use automated decision making in the following circumstances:
For the purposes of securing transactions placed through our websites/apps/devices against fraud. We may use a third party provider’s solution to protect against fraud. The method of fraud detection is based on a number of different data prediction and data intelligence techniques that may change over time, to keep up with technological advancement. These may include, for example, data comparison or association, or detecting outlier (unusual) data patterns. This fraud detection process may be completely automated or may involve some human intervention where the final decision is taken by a person.
As a result of automatic fraud detection, you may experience a delay in the processing of your order/request whilst we review your transaction. You may be limited or excluded from using a service if a risk of fraud is identified.
You have the right to access the information on which we base our decision.
Profiling
This means automatically processing personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects about an individual, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
When we send or display personalised communications or content, we may use some profiling techniques. This means that we may collect personal data about you in the different scenarios mentioned in the table above, and use this data to analyse, evaluate, or predict your personal preferences, interests, behaviour and/or location.
Based on our analysis, we then send or display communications and/or content specifically tailored to your interests and needs.
You may have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal data for “profiling”. Please see “Your Rights and Choices” section below.
Who may access your Personal data?
First, we want to be clear that we do not sell your personal data.
