You should exercise caution when adding Customer Content to your Public Profile (or another’s) or when using social networking sites and never disclose your personal information or any other information which you would not want to be in the public domain, now or in the future.
External links
This privacy policy covers only our websites, which is www.loveknitting.com and www.lovecrochet.com
Our website may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. If you follow a link to any of those sites, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites and we suggest that you check those policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

Security
We take the privacy and security of your details very seriously, but any Internet data transmission bears risks. All payment transactions are securely encrypted using SSL technology.
You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Any online payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
We do not store your credit or debit card details, except as follows, and with your consent.
If you consent (to avoid the need to re-enter these details each time you shop with us, and so make purchasing quicker and simpler), we will store an encrypted token that represents your payment card and will reveal only the last four digits and expiry date of your credit or debit card number when confirming an order. We also display the last four digits of your credit card and card type on your receipt. Only these details are stored on our systems and an encrypted token which is unique to our Website. Your full credit or debit card number is never stored on any of our systems. This token is transmitted to the payment provider during the order processing. If you have chosen not to register your card details with us, we will only store the last four digits for the purpose of our communications with you, but for the purpose of a transaction, the entire card number is, of course, transmitted to the appropriate credit card company to process your order. Security codes (CVC) are never stored and will have to be entered for every transaction.
You should protect your password and your computer from unauthorised access by others, and always make sure you sign off when you finish on a shared computer.
Storage of your information
By submitting your data, you agree that we may transfer, store and process your information.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'), including in countries where you may have fewer rights under local law. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your information and using our Services, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside the EEA. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law including the Data Protection Act 1998.
Your rights
You may request us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes and to see the information we hold about you.
The Data Protection Act gives you the right of access to information held about you. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. You also have the right to correct any errors in this information.
