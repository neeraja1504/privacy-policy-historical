What are “cookies” / “clear GIFs” and how do we use them?
Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Site utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us.
Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or capture any of the Personally Identifiable Information that resides on your computer.
Clear GIFs: At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information and only track the visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.
Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company.
How do we store your information?
If you have taken a quiz, information about your quiz answers and results is stored in a database on our server.  This information is identified by a unique ID number, which may be associated with your email address (if you choose to provide one, as it is optional and your quiz data will remain anonymous if you choose not to enter an email address).
Your information is stored at the list server that delivers our newsletters. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage those lists in order to deliver e-mail newsletters.
All of the newsletters that are sent to you include an unsubscribe link in them at the very bottom. You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking that link.
You can remove yourself at any time from our mailing lists to prevent any further automated emails sent from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link. You can also contact us at info@lovelearnings.com to change your information or unsubscribe at any time.
Links To Other Websites
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
