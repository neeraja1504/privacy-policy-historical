Information obtained through Cookies. We use Cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting and using the Services. “ Cookies ” are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our Website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on Cookies for the proper operation of the Services; therefore if your browser is set to reject all Cookies, the Services may not function properly. Users who refuse Cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality with respect to the Services.

We may also use Web Beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers, such as whether an email has been opened or acted upon.

Email messages we send to you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the email was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails and other promotional communications from us at any time via the opt-out links provided in such communications, or by e-mailing privacy@lovingly.com with your specific request.

If you are a Customer who has purchased flowers or other products from a Retailer, that Retailer may have Personal Data about you. You must contact that Retailer to exercise your rights with respect to any information they hold about you.
** Customer Information**
Retailers are responsible for what they do with any Personal Data they collect, directly or through our Services, about their Customers. Retailers are solely responsible for complying with any laws and regulations that apply to the collection and use of Customers’ information, including Personal Data that Retailers collect about Customers from us or by using functionality provided through any of our Services.
Lovingly is not liable for any Retailer’s relationship with their Customers or for such Retailer’s collection and use of a Customer’s Personal Data (even if you collect it from us directly or using functionality provided through our Services). We cannot provide Retailers with any legal advice regarding collection of Personal Data.
Customers’ payment information may be processed via third party payment processors, whose services may be integrated with our own Services. Such integrations will allow our third party payment processors to collect Customers’ payment information in accordance with such payment processor’s terms of service and privacy policy. We do not collect or store Customers’ payment information.
THIRD PARTY SITES
The Services may contain links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own Cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Data from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Data you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
HOW WE RESPOND TO LEGAL REQUESTS OR PREVENT HARM
We may access, preserve and share your information without notice or consent from you in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our the Services. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Only individuals over the age of 18 are eligible to use our Services. However, we pay particular attention to children’s privacy. Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect, maintain or use Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Data, you may alert us at privacy@lovingly.com. Should we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete that information from our database and terminate the child’s account.
SECURING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
** Security Measures**
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, the inherent insecurity of the Internet and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Data at any time. Nevertheless, we strive to safeguard Personal Data to ensure that information is kept private and secure at all times. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are intended to appropriately protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse and any other unlawful form of processing of, the Personal Data in our possession. We employ security measures such as using firewalls to protect against intruders, building redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it) and testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities.
** Data Retention**
We retain Personal Data regarding you or your use of the Services for as long as your Account is active or for as long as needed to provide you or our Customers with the Services. We also retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests.
The precise periods for which we keep your Personal Data vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the Personal Data has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your Account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.
Because you may use the Services sporadically or come back to us after an Account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately delete your Personal Data when your trial expires or you cancel the Services. Instead, we keep your Personal Data for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
You may delete your Account by contacting us at privacy@lovingly.com and we will delete the Personal Data we hold about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).
