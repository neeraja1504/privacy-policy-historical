Full inboxes, down email addresses and fraud. Love-Sessions is not responsible for errors in your mail box such as full or down mail addresses. We do not refund in such cases. You can always still ask Love-Sessions to send the issue once more. In case you claim a refund through your credit card company with reasons such as we would not have delivered the service you paid for: In those cases Love-Sessions will forward the email advice issue to your credit card company (incl. email header) to prove we delivered you our service as agreed. In case a credit card company demands a refund due to fraud, we will also forward the advice issue with all details to the credit card company, to prevent and prosecute fraud. Due to the fact that the person who's card is used to receive advice is a fraud, we believe the advice is not under privacy rules any more. Further more we will report the email address where the advice is asked to be send, to the provider, police, and credit card fraud department. *In some cases we mention on the site that due to maintenance the period is longer then the normal 24hrs response time. In this case you will see a clear text on the sign up page.
