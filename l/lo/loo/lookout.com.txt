1. We Only Collect Your Personal Information When We Need It To Provide You A Service.
We are committed to only collecting the information necessary to provide and improve the Lookout Services. When we do collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information under the terms described in this Privacy Policy.
Note that some of our products, like Lookout Labs, which are standalone products,  collect only limited information or no information at all. Not every section of this Privacy Policy will apply to these products.
2. Information Lookout Collects
a. Registration Information
To create an account, you must provide your email address and a password. You may also enter your mobile phone number on our website to initiate a text message with directions on how to download the app and register.
b. Credit Card Information
If you wish to upgrade to a Premium Account billed directly to us, we collect your credit card number, expiration date, and security code. We use this information to bill you for services.
c. Device Information
When you use Lookout Services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device. This information may include information such as an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier / operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide our services. For example, collecting your device’s phone number allows the service to contact your phone via SMS when you locate your phone from the Lookout web application.
d. Employment Application Information
If you wish to fill out our application form, we will ask for your name, email address, phone number, and allow you to upload your resume. We use this information to determine if you are an eligible candidate for an available position, to contact you to set up an interview if appropriate and to follow up with you about your application experience.
e. Social Media Features
Our website includes social media Features (“Features”), like the Facebook recommend button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. If you use these Features, they will collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Features may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the Feature, not by Lookout’s Privacy Policy.
f. Information About Your Use of Lookout Services on Your Phone
We use mobile analytics software so that we can improve our products. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.
g. Information About Your Use of Lookout’s Website and Mobile Website
We use an analytics service to measure how people use our website so that we can improve our products and services. The analytics service works by embedding invisible images that are associated with unique identifiers on our site. We do not tie the information gathered through the use of clear images to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
3. What You Should Know About Specific Products
a. Security and Anti-Virus
Lookout Security and Anti-Virus products, which are available on different platforms, protect your device from malware and spyware. They scan files and applications as they are installed or accessed, automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update your threat definitions. In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning. This may include downloading entire copies of files to your device (though you can opt out of this feature and still use the Anti-Virus product).
What types of information Security and Anti-Virus collect:
Information about the type of device you are using and the operating system you are running.
Lookout’s Security and Anti-Virus products collect information about the type of device and operating system you are running so that we can both improve our products and also give you more accurate information about malware and spyware that might affect you and your device(s).
Information about scans and scan results.
We collect information about the applications on your device in order to conduct scans and to download copies of scanned files, if you have not opted out of that functionality. We also may collect information about how applications behave on your device (e.g., whether an application is sending premium-rate text messages that charge money to your phone bill) and the network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g., whether an application is talking to a server known to host phishing websites). Each time Lookout performs a scan, we collect information that describes what files and applications are identified by the scan as potentially undesirable and your choice for remediation of those files (e.g., uninstall or ignore).
How the information that Security and Anti-Virus collect is used:
Our purpose in collecting application data and security scan data is to provide you with Security and Anti-Virus services. We also use this data to optimize and improve this and other Lookout Services and products.
We may aggregate your data with other customers’ data in non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and anonymized form to better understand current malware and spyware threats and to improve the Anti-Virus service. We may also share this anonymous aggregated data publicly, in order to help others understand mobile threats and gain insights into particular mobile applications.
b. Backup
Lookout Backup securely stores copies of data that you choose to back up from your phone.
What types of information Backup collects:
Backup Data.
Backup transmits a copy of the data you choose to back up to on your device to a secure server, using an encrypted protocol. The data may include your contacts, call history, pictures and other data. Lookout Backup automatically backs up your data weekly or daily, based on your settings, can restore your data to a new or existing phone, and allows you to retrieve your data any time from Lookout.com.
How the information that Backup collects is used:
If you choose to use the Lookout Backup feature, we will use the data you provide to deliver the Backup service. In order to notify you in the case of malicious behavior on your phone, Lookout may scan both the data that is stored on your phone and backed up to our servers. For example, some malware has been known to spread via malicious text messages or steal money by dialing expensive phone numbers. To detect this, our system would scan the SMS messages or call history stored on your phone or backed up on our servers.
c. Missing Device
Lookout Missing Device helps you find and secure your phone or tablet if it is lost or stolen. You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, activate a loud siren even if your volume is muted so that you can find a phone lost nearby, wipe your phone, or lock your phone. Features and settings are controlled through our website at Lookout.com.
What types of information Missing Device collects:
Location Data.
Lookout derives location information in two ways. We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information. We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information.
How the information that Missing Device collects is used:
Our purpose in collecting this information is to provide you with the location of your phone when you request it. If you activate the locate feature in Missing Device, your browser will send location information to Google Maps in order to display a map of the location within your Lookout account webpage. When activating this feature, we track the phone’s location for several minutes in order to provide an accurate location for you. This information is retained in your account history for as long as you wish and may be deleted by you at any time, from your account settings. If you choose to delete this information or disable your account, Lookout anonymizes this data so that it is no longer associated with an any personally identifiable information. We keep that anonymized data for aggregate statistical purposes only.
d. Signal Flare
Signal Flare collects and stores information in the same way as Missing Device (see above). If you have enabled Signal Flare, it collects location information and sends it back to Lookout only when your battery is running low.  After which, we save the phone's location at the time we received the low battery alert to Lookout.com. This feature will help you locate your phone near its last known location if you lose it and its battery dies.
e. Safe Browsing
Safe Browsing is a feature available when using the Android default browser or the Chrome browser.  Safe Browsing identifies and warns you of unsafe websites so that you can choose to avoid visiting them.
What types of information Safe Browsing collects:
URLs.
To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you visit on your phone to a Lookout-provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g., if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malwares, or exploits). If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.
How the information that Safe Browsing collects is used:
We use the record of unsafe URLs you visit (1) to provide you with notice that you attempted to reach an unsafe site (e.g., when you log in to the Lookout website or via email) and (2) to improve our product. If you do not want us to record the unsafe URLs you visit, you may turn Safe Browsing off; all other Lookout features will continue to function.
f. Lock Cam
Lookout's Lock Cam feature uses your device’s camera and location features to help you figure out where your device might be (and who might have it) in the event that your device is lost or stolen. If activated, Lock Cam monitors when your password has been entered incorrectly a few times on your device or our app’s lock screen. It then activates your device’s camera remotely, without sound or other notification, and sends the resulting picture and its GPS coordinates to the email address associated with your account. For example, if someone steals your phone and fails to enter your password at least three times, Lock Cam could allow you to see what they look like and figure out where they are without alerting them.
What types of information Lock Cam collects:
Password and technical data.
In addition to the photographic and location information described above, Lock Cam keeps track of how frequently an incorrect password is entered.
How the information that Lock Cam collects is used:
When Lock Cam is activated and a photo is taken, the picture and location data are stored briefly on our servers so we can send you an email with the picture and a map of your device’s location. The picture and location data are then deleted. We send the email to the address associated with your account (or for Group Plans, to the address associated with the device that took the photo), so remember to keep your email address up to date in your account settings. We use technical information about Lock Cam’s activities on your device only to study, optimize, and troubleshoot our products.
g. Group Plans
Group Plans link multiple devices to one master account that controls the Group Plan owner’s device as well as certain features of devices associated with the Group Plan. Users of the additional devices on the plan retain their own unique accounts, but Group Plan owners have control over some functions of Group Plan members’ devices, as described below.
What types of information Group Plans collect:
Lookout does not collect any additional information from users in Group Plans.
How the information that Group Plans collects is used:
In a Group Plan, such as a Family Plan, one master user has authority to perform certain functions on devices belonging to other members of the group. For example, in a Family Plan, a parent phone may be able to lock, wipe, restore, or locate a child’s phone. The latter feature would allow a parent to access data about the child’s phone as described in the section on “Missing Device.” A parent phone, or other device having authority over other Group Plan users, generally does not have access to the data on a child’s phone unless, for example, the phone is restored to another device to which the parent phone has access.
Users must agree to give the “parent” this functionality. You can determine if your phone is part of a Group Plan by checking the settings functions in your phone.
Lookout does not share any personally identifiable information collected from use of the Lookout Services in Group Plans with its partners, except as otherwise described in this policy..
4. Cookie Policy
Like many online services, we use cookies and other tools to collect and analyze information about you and your usage of our Services. Cookies are small data files that we transfer to your computer. We use “session” cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Services, to better understand how you interact with our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic information on our Services. Session cookies disappear when you log out and close your browser. We also use “persistent” cookies to recognize you when you return to our Services. Persistent cookies can stay on your computer for a longer period of time than session cookies do.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings or use third-party tools to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit. You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have. Please be aware that some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.
Cookies From Third-Parties
We believe it is important for you to know exactly what cookies we use in our Services. Here is a list of the third-party cookies that we use, a link to the privacy policy governing the cookie and information about how you can opt out.

AddThis — The social sharing site creates and reads this JavaScript on the client side in order to make sure the user sees the updated count if they share a page and return to it before our share count cache is updated. No data from that cookie is sent back to AddThis and removing it when disabling cookies would cause unexpected behavior for users.

5. We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information to Provide and Improve Our Services

7. We Notify You if we Are Required by Law to Disclose Your Personally Identifiable Information
Like other companies, we may be required to preserve or disclose your information if after due consideration, we determine it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect Lookout’s rights or property. However, we strongly believe that you have a right to know when we will respond to a request for your information in time to give you the opportunity to object.  Therefore, it is our policy to notify you at the email listed in your account of a request for your information before we preserve or disclose it, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. Furthermore, nothing in this Privacy Policy is meant to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including the government’s request to disclose your information.
8. We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information When Necessary to Provide Our Services
We only use your Personal Information to improve our services. This may include sharing aspects of your Personal Information with 3rd parties (for example, to map your location or send you an SMS).  We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy, that they use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and that they use appropriate confidentiality and security measures to protect your information.
9. We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information to Avoid Unnecessary Marketing

Lookout is a security company, and securing your data is one of our top priorities. Lookout uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards. For example, we use a combination of firewalls, encryption, authentication, physical security, and other safeguards to protect your account and your data.
We perform third-party penetration tests to harden our systems from attack.

All such receipt or transmission of your information is at your own risk.
We cannot guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or location based information) on our website, within the Lookout app, or in our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
If Lookout learns of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Lookout may also post a notice on the Lookout Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
16. You Are Responsible for Maintaining the Accuracy and Confidentiality of Your Email Address and Password
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password at all times. We recommend a strong password that you do not use with other services. If you believe your password has been compromised, please change your password immediately via the Lookout website, or contact us at support@lookout.com for assistance.
You are responsible for ensuring that the email address associated with your account is accurate.
