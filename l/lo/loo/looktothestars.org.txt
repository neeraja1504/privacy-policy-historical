Privacy and Cookie Policy - Look to the Stars
Last updated 27th March 2014.
This notice explains how we will process your personal information
Why we collect your data
By collecting your data, it allows us to understand what your needs and wants are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you. It also allows us to provide targeted offers and services you may be interested to hear about.
Who we are
Look To The Stars Limited, Company Number GB07665476, United Kingdom.
In the event that we sell our business, customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. If this happens, your information will still be subject to this policy.
Cookies and IP Addresses
When you visit one of our websites, we may send you a cookie. A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer or device.
Essential Cookies
These cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For example, we use cookies to help us identify which of our readers have a subscription in order to access paid for content held on the website.
Analytical Performance Cookies
We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance and how their users may use it. These cookies provide us with information that helps us provide better products to their users and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance. For example, we may use performance cookies on our website to provide the most popular news articles further up the page of the website.
Functional Cookies
Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites. This can be anything from remembering your city to saving your username.
Behavioural Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies
We, and our advertisers/sponsors, may use cookies to provide tailored advertising to you which we believe are relevant to you. Online behavioural advertising is a way of providing advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your interests. This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity. Advertising is then displayed to you when you visit a website which matches these interests.
Behavioural advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time - so it's different to advertising you may see when you're looking for something online using a search engine (e.g. Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time. As an example, you may be doing research in order to buy a bicycle and read a number of different articles on a number of different websites. If a bicycle manufacturer was part of an advertising network, they may think that you are interested in buying a bicycle and serve you with one of their adverts for one of their bicycles. It is possible that from reading these articles elsewhere, you would see this advert on one of our or someone else's websites. We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your computer by third party advertisers and sponsors. We may also track IP addresses.
How to control the use of cookies
You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use. You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you control over what is set on your device, however has the drawback of slowing down your browsing experience.
There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just third party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of behavioural advertising, and some even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies.
In order to manage your cookies, please follow the instructions provided by your browser supplier for your PC or device.
How can I prevent Online Behavioural Advertising?
Further to using your browser to controlling the use of cookies, there are also other ways that you can opt out of Online Behavioural Advertising.
The "Your Online Choices" page provided by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), provides an easy way to opt out of behavioural advertising from each (or all) of the networks represented by the IAB.
Our behavioural advertising partners include Google/Doubleclick, and you can view their privacy policies and opt out on "Your Online Choices".

As part of our email communications and website analyses, we may use web beacons and track URLs.
Web beacons are electronic files that count users who access a website or page and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons on web pages or email communications allow us to see how successful an article may be or that an email message was successfully delivered and read.
Tracked URLs will count the amount of clicks on a web page. This allows us to edit the site according to the popularity of the articles you read.
You can't decline web beacons. However by preventing cookies being used on your computer, you can prevent web beacons from tracking your activity. For information about managing your cookie options, please click here.
Please be aware that if you disable cookies, many services on our websites will not be available to you, particularly those that contain personalised content as outlined in the section Personalised content.

Personalised content
The content on our websites and in our email communications may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you. Advertising content may be adjusted depending on personal information.

We may supply personal data to trusted suppliers for analysis purposes. This will be done under agreement with us and will be in line with this policy.

This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
Payment and credit checks
