During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching LoopNet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. LoopNet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, LoopNet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to LoopNet. Professional brokers agree to share their contact information and allow all LoopNet users to view their contact information via the LoopNet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. LoopNet users LoopNet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that LoopNet's partners make of customer information will not exceed LoopNet's use of the data.
