You may take down any information you have added to the Interactive Areas at any time. (Please also see below “ACCESSING, CORRECTING AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION” for information about how to delete information we hold about you).

Usage Data includes information regarding any interaction you have with the Site or Platform, such as which functionalities are used and the frequency of use (e.g., pages visited, actions taken, queries run, fields added, user accounts, account roles, and connected database types).
License checks including the number of users, roles, and database connections.
Analytics Data includes information gathered via our licensing management service, which sends data to Looker concerning the performance of the Site or Platform.
If a Looker customer uses the software to analyze personal data in their databases, Looker will process the categories of personal data analyzed, which may include special categories of data as determined by the customer, including without limitation factors specific to the individual’s physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
Information gathered through cookies, pixel tags, logs, or other similar technologies. See “COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES” section below.
Additional Information Collected By The Looker Platform
When you use the Platform, create an account to use the Platform (or someone, such as your organization’s administrator, creates an account on your behalf), additional information about your use of the Platform is collected:
Unique identifier(s) we assign to users as part of monitoring user experience.
If you choose to log into the Platform using external directory systems or single sign-on services, these services enable you to share with us certain information to authenticate your identity and pre-populate certain forms on the Platform. Note that even if you subsequently stop using the services, we will retain the information you have shared with us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information contained in your organization’s Looker database used with the Platform, to which we have access when we automatically back it up and encrypt it for you.
As well as the processes described above, you may also choose: not to provide certain Personal Information when requested (e.g. via forms available on the Site); and/or to opt-out of the collection of certain Personal Information by us, by emailing us at markops-requests@looker.com.
See also “COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES” section below for information about how information generated using these technologies is used.
Looker also may collect information that does not identify or locate you personally, meaning business information such as SIC code, industry, number of employees, or sales funnel status. Looker reserves the right to maintain, disclose, or otherwise use such information without limitation including aggregated with other information to improve the Site, Platform and services offered by Looker.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
This section describes the ways we use and store Personal Information.
Information Stored in Looker
Looker uses a read-only connection to access the minimum amount of data needed to answer your questions and only returns the relevant result set. Alternatively, customers can choose to give Looker write-access to their database to take advantage of PDTs (persistent derived tables). This feature lets you define summary tables that Looker will write on your behalf into your database, at a cadence of your choosing.
Accordingly, Looker holds two types of Personal Information, in two ways: information about Looker users, and the customer data necessary to answer Looker users’ queries.
Information about Looker users. This information about Looker users includes end-user login/registration information for Looker users as well as metadata about their usage. Metadata is used to facilitate product improvements, customer support and license auditing. Login information is controlled by customers directly as it is entered on their Looker instance and they can delete their users’ (i.e. their employees’) information at any time. We retain basic user contact information to send product updates, relevant marketing, training and events based on the users’ communication preferences.
Customer data necessary to answer users’ queries. Once Looker is connected to a customer database, the Looker cache retains data from the customer’s database that is fetched in response to its users’ queries. This data is encrypted and stored by Looker for a maximum of 30 days or 2GB of data—whichever occurs first. If you prefer, you can also take additional steps to reduce the amount of time that query results are held in cache.
How Information May Be Used By The Looker Site
Looker may use the Personal Information collected by the Site or Platform as follows:
To respond to your requests for information about our products, services, training and events.
To provide product enablement and licensing, customer service and support.
To administer your account if you have registered on the Site or Platform, including billing and payment.
To enable your access and use of the Site or Platform, and to enable you to communicate, collaborate, and share information with those you designate.
To send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.
To inform you about our products and services.
To apply information security policies and controls on the Site, including overall Site integrity, identity management and account authentication.
For legal compliance, such as to enforce our legal rights, to comply in good faith with applicable laws, and to protect users of the Site or Platform.
For other general business management and operations purposes, such as to provide, operate, maintain, make modifications to protect and improve the Site or Platform.
To send marketing, advertising, training or event materials to which you’ve agreed, requested or subscribed.
For research and development to improve the Looker product, Platform and services.
For other purposes about which we notify you and, where relevant or required, give you choice about the new purpose.
Additional Information Used By The Looker Platform
Looker may use your Personal Information collected by the Platform as follows, depending upon the nature of your Looker deployment:
To administer your Platform user account.
To enable your access and use of the Platform, and to enable you to communicate, collaborate, and share information with those you designate.
To enable your access and use of Platform Integration and Application services.
To monitor your user experience on the Platform.
To enable Looker to proactively help customers maintain the performance and functionality of deployments of the Platform.
To enable Looker to verify your license to use the Platform.
Choice, Control and Access
This section describes the ways you can exercise your rights to access and control your Personal Information.
Email Communications Preferences
Looker respects your email communications and marketing preferences. If you prefer not to receive product release notes communications or promotional email messages (such as marketing, events, training) from Looker, you can unsubscribe from Looker’s email marketing list by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each promotional email, going to our subscription center, or contacting us at markops-requests@looker.com with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line. Note: Please allow five (5) business days to be removed from all email communications.
Accessing, Correcting And Deleting Your Personal Information
Ensuring that Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and complete is important to us. If you would like to request access to, correct or delete the Personal Information, please send us an email at markops-requests@looker.com. We will verify these requests and respond to you in accordance with our legal obligations, which typically means forwarding your request to the licensed administrator (customer) of your Looker account for review.
To request removal of your personal information from an Interactive Area, please contact us at markops-requests@looker.com.
Looker customers create and remain in control of your data and data about your users and user activities and reports. When you remove users from your Looker-connected database instance, their data will be removed from Looker’s databases within 30 days and within 30 days they will no longer remain in Looker's cache. If you wish to delete a Looker user’s account data, we have a process to permanently anonymize the data by data engineering, either self-serve or on request. If you would like Looker to delete your customer data or Looker user account detail, please send an email to privacy@looker.com.
Accountability and Onward Transfer
This section describes our accountability with regard to the onward transfer of your Personal Information to third party service providers (suppliers), partners and across country borders.

This may include disclosures: to respond to subpoenas or court orders; to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Service Agreement, or as otherwise required by law. In each case, we will make reasonable efforts to verify the validity of the request before disclosing your personal information.
To enforce our agreements, policies and Terms of Service.

We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party in connection with a merger or acquisition of Looker, either in part or in whole, or the assignment or other transfer of the Site. In such event, such third party will either:
Continue to honor the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy; or

International Transfer And Storage Of Information Collected
We primarily store information collected from you within the European Economic Area, the United States and in other countries and territories. By default, Looker hosts in the U.S. region, but at the customer’s request, we can host in various other regions, including within the EU, Asia and Latin America, which varies based on each unique customer circumstances. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which Looker has operations. For customers who need to be hosted inside the EU, we host in the Dublin, Ireland region. Customers can also host their own Looker instance on their own servers. We use applicable, approved information transfer mechanisms where required, such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield.
