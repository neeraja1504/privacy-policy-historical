Part 3 – How we keep your personal data secure
Data security
We take the security of all the personal data we hold very seriously. We adhere to internationally recognised security standards and we have a framework of policies, procedures and training in place covering data protection, confidentiality and security and regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the personal data we hold secure.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Part 4 – Deleting your personal data
Data Retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.
Our default retention periods for customer records are: (i) call detail records shall be retained for approximately 12 months from the date of the call; (ii) call recordings shall be available for 60 days then deleted around 90 days thereafter (subject to purge rules and timings); and (iii) basic information about our customers for six years after ceasing being customers (for tax and regulatory reasons).
Deletion
All personal data shall be deleted or erased in a secure and confidential manner.
Part 5 – Know your rights
Your rights
Individuals have certain rights over their personal data and data controllers are responsible for fulfilling these rights. Where we decide how and why personal data is processed, we are a data controller and include further information about the rights that individuals have and how to exercise them below.
Access to personal data
You have a right to access your personal data (“data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
To make a request, you need to put the request in writing addressing it to our Legal department at the address provided above. If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone.
If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by, once again, contacting the Legal department.
Amendment of personal data
To update personal data submitted to us, you may email us at privacy@loopup.com or, where appropriate, contact us via the relevant website registration page or by amending the personal details held on relevant applications with which you registered.
When practically possible, once we are informed that any personal data processed by us is no longer accurate, we will make corrections (where appropriate) based on your updated information.
Withdrawal of consent
Where we process personal data based on consent, individuals have a right to withdraw consent at any time. We do not generally process personal data based on consent (as we can usually rely on another legal basis). To withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data please email us at privacy@loopup.com or, to stop receiving an email from our marketing list, please click on the unsubscribe link in the relevant email received from us.
Object to processing
You may object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying upon a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some case, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Transfer requests
You may request the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Request erasure
You may request the erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continuing to process it.
Request restriction on processing
You may request the restriction of processing of your personal data by us. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the personal data’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate interest grounds to use it.
Complaints
We hope that you won’t ever need to, but if you do want to complain about our use of personal data, please send an email with the details of your complaint to privacy@loopup.com. We will look into and respond to any complaints we receive.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection regulator. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the appropriate regulator. In the UK that is the Information Commissioner’s Office. For further information on your rights and how to complain to your local data protection regulator, please contact us or refer to the local data protection regulator’s website.
This privacy policy was drafted with clarity in mind. It does not provide exhaustive detail of all aspects of our collection and use of personal information. However, we are happy to provide any additional information or explanation needed. Any requests for this should be sent to the address above.
Part 6 – Updating this policy
