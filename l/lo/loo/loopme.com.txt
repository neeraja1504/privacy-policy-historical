Privacy Policy | LoopMe
LoopMe Ltd is committed to protecting consumer privacy and respecting your right to choice as it relates to advertising and the data used to help serve ads relevant to those consumers. LoopMe Ltd is a technology company that helps advertisers connect with consumers who are interested in, or could benefit from, the advertisers’ products. Protecting consumer privacy is a top priority to LoopMe Ltd. See below for our complete privacy policy.
LoopMe Ltd (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides an online advertising and technology platform and services. We provide this privacy policy to inform you about how we collect and use data on our corporate website, which is located at www.loopme.com (the “Website”), and how our technology platform and related technology, such as pixels` (“Technology”) processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our services (those publishers and online advertisers and their agencies who use our technology are defined as our “Clients”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to companies that LoopMe Ltd does not own or control, including LoopMe’s Clients. To learn more about how LoopMe’s Clients collect, use, and disclose information about consumers, please visit the Clients’ privacy policies.
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@looopme.com.
Privacy Practices for Our Technology
LoopMe runs a buying platform for media and data. LoopMe Technology allows our Clients to buy ad space on websites, in apps, and on other digital platforms, and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that ad space. When ad space is bought or sold digitally (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a publisher or other content provider) the Technology, fulfils the transaction by delivering the ad to internet and mobile users who visit that site, use that application, or watch certain videos (for example).
Generally, an Internet user’s computer, browser or device comes into contact with LoopMe when a user views an ad delivered or serviced by or with our Technology. Serving users relevant advertising is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising (“IBA”).
What Information Do We Collect?
Our Technology collects or receives information that may include, but is not limited to, your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, specific location information of your device (which may be derived from, for example, your device’s GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals), pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, your operating system, device type, handset name, mobile identifiers such as apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, application specific identifiers, as well as how you interact with a web page, application or advertisement.
Predicted or actual data about a consumer such as age, gender, date of birth, income, education, interests, usage activity, from Clients or other third parties.
Information about the possible relationships among different devices. For example, a tablet and laptop with similar characteristics such as IP address, user agent, font settings, screen resolution, and plug-ins may be assumed to belong to the same consumer.
We may obtain the above information from other ad platforms, application platforms or providers, Clients or websites and services (including our Clients).
LoopMe may offer advertising solutions to clients that include the collection of voluntary personal information from you as part of an advertisement, e.g. serving an ad that contains an advertiser questionnaire. Such information may consist of personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information, or both. All of the information that you voluntarily provide in response to this form of advertisement is forwarded directly to the relevant Client and will be governed by that Client’s privacy policies in place at the time of transfer. This information may be temporarily stored by LoopMe solely for the aforesaid purpose, subject to applicable legal requirements.
How Do We Use The Information With Collect?
LoopMe uses the information that we collect from your device to display advertising on your device, which may include interest-based advertising customised to an individual’s inferred interests, preferences and locations and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services.
The information we collect from your device also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for advertisers. This helps our publishers and developer Clients, for example, to avoid presenting you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser Clients serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you.
LoopMe Ltd uses data to target and serve, or to help our Clients to target and serve, relevant advertising to consumers and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences, as well as to compile, match and link audiences on behalf of Clients. For instance, we may, or help our Clients to, use this data to:
Determine what ad to show a consumer, and customize ads to particular types of audiences
Customize ads to the type of web page users are viewing
Limit the number of times a consumer sees an ad or a type of ad
Perform analysis of how effective the ads are
Help Clients learn more about their own consumers
Fraud detection and prevention
Evaluate the probability and nature of connections between devices
Client reporting, both in an aggregated and non-aggregated form
Auditing, researching, troubleshooting and analysing data in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly
Who Do We Share Information With?
We share the information we collect to provide and improve LoopMe services, as well as to enable and allow for the improvement of related services provided by LoopMe Customers or other third party partners in connection with the LoopMe Services and across the broader advertising ecosystem, as follows:
Primarily, we work with Clients and other third parties to help optimize ads and make them more likely to be relevant to consumers, by comparing, syncing and sharing the data described above. For instance, we may share to other ad platforms, customers or websites and services (including our Clients) data we have collected (generally, unique, identifiers representing consumers’ devices), in order for these third parties to match their unique identifiers to our own, so that we can “sync” identifiers in order to help them show more relevant ads, match consumers to their likely interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.
Further, the data we collect and receive may be processed on our behalf by third-party service providers that assist us in running our business, including providers of data storage and processing facilities.
We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual activities that may harm any person, our company, the Technology, or otherwise violate any law.
Also, in the event LoopMe is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of LoopMe’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by LoopMe may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
We may share non-personal information with Clients, both in an aggregated and non-aggregated form, in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis (such as the creation of predictive models).
How Do We Keep Information Secure?

LoopMe uses reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction and alteration of the information that our Technology collects.
