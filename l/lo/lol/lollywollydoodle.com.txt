We may vary the content you receive in future visits to a Site based on your preferences and activities.
We may combine your personally identifying information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through our site in a particular geographic region. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality fellow users through more accurate marketing and advertising of our website.
Disclosure of Information
We may provide your personally identifying information, and information about your activities and preferences, to other companies wishing to contact you about products or services, but only to those that we believe impose reasonable safeguards on the privacy of your information. We may also provide these companies with collective profiles of our user groups and their activities and preferences. Such collective profiles may also be disclosed in describing our site and services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
We may work with third party advertising services providers who may use their own cookies to measure how many times advertising content has been viewed and to serve you advertising that may be more relevant to you. For more information on such practices and an opportunity to opt-out of them, please visit http://www.aboutads.info.
In the event that a third party merges with us, acquires us or acquires our assets related to the information that you have provided, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from you as part of that merger, acquisition or acquisition of assets.
Finally, we may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm.

Security
We use industry-standard encryption methods to transmit your personal registration information from your computer to ours across the Internet, and we restrict access to any transactional portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher, Mozilla Firefox 2.0 or higher or Google Chrome 1.0 or higher. These browsers will automatically activate the technology when you log on to our site.
Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access our site, which you select at registration, should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished using our site, you should log off and exit your browser so no unauthorized persons can use our site with your name and account information. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose online in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate websites that are linked to or from our Site or a Site governed by this policy, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.
Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. E-mail communications, in particular, are not secure.
Special Policy on Information Regarding Teens (persons 13 to 17 years of age)
Teens are required to provide the email address of a parent or guardian before submitting any personally identifiable information. A notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all guests who identify themselves as being between 13 and 17 years of age, which discloses the information provided by the teen and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the teen's online experience.
