LolSided
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us.
Data Controller.
The controller of personal data is Wayne Whitty, who owns and operates LolSided.com. Wayne Whitty is based in the Republic of Ireland. If you wish to make a query about our personal data processing or if you wish to obtain information on the processing of your personal data, please use one of the contact options on our contact page.
What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our app?
We do not keep a long-term record of personally identifiable information. Our app is built in such a way that storing your Facebook information in a database would be completely unnecessary. If you have taken any of our quizzes in the past, then you can rest assured that we have not kept a database record of any of your personally identifiable information.
The only reason we would ever keep a record of your personally identifiable information is if we believe that your account activity is abnormal or you are suspected of violating our Terms of Service.
Third-party disclosure.
We do NOT sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. If you agree to provide us with access to your name, gender, etc, that information remains with LolSided.com and it is never transferred to a third-party.
Temporary PII storage.
Any personally identifiable information that is saved on our server is saved in a temporary session file that is automatically expired and removed within an hour of your session expiring.
To manually expire your session, you can click on the "Log Out" button in the top right-hand corner of our app.
If you forget to click on the "Log Out" button, your session data will be automatically expired and removed from our server after a short period of time.
If we cache your profile picture for performance reasons, that profile picture is saved and named in such a way that it is not linked to the rest of your personal information.
If we do cache your profile picture, it is for the sole intention of speeding up the time that it takes us to provide you with a quiz result.
If you do not share any of our results, cached profile pictures are automatically removed from our server within an hour after they have first been cached.
If you do share one of our results, your cached profile picture may be stored for roughly 45 days. This image is stored in such a way that it is not linked to your name or the rest of your personally identifiable information.
In certain cases, LolSided.com may log Facebook IDs, IP addresses or names for the purpose of generating statistics and identifying user behavior. These log files are temporary and are automatically deleted by our servers after a couple of days.
In the vast majority of cases, this data is automatically removed and compiled into non-identifying aggregate data every 60 seconds.
How do we use your information?
We use your information to provide you with personalized Facebook results. Example: By giving us access to your basic Facebook public profile information, you give us the ability to generate personalized quiz results that include your name, profile picture and gender-related pronouns.
Facebook permissions.
Our app abides by the Platform Policy for Facebook developers. Our app does not make any unnecessary requests for Facebook permissions. We only request data and permissions that our app requires to generate results.
In most cases, we only ask for your basic profile information: This includes your Facebook profile ID, name, profile picture and gender.
On quizzes that involve a member of your friend list, we will ask for the friend list permission.
We do NOT ask for access to your interests, likes, timeline posts, photo albums or messages.
For more information on what Facebook information we request, please see our article on Facebook Permissions.
