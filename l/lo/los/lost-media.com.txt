* Communications From You to Us. If you send correspondence or email to us or otherwise communicate with us, we may retain copies of the communications to assist you or for our records.
* Cookies. When you browse to www.fan-sites.org, our system sends a small file called a “cookie” to your computer that identifies your browser. This allows us to recognize you for purposes of saving your preferences or providing personalized service. We use cookies to record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, or customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
