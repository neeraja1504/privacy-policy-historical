LOADEDCASH PRIVACY POLICY
LoadedCash ("we", "us", "our", "LoadedCash") offers this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform the person or entity who is the owner/operator of an Internet site ("you", "your", "Website Operator") submitting an online application to participate in the LoadedCash program (the "Program") of how we define, gather and utilize personal information.
We reserve the right to alter or modify these Terms, the Program or any provision, including commission rates, associated with the Program at any time. It is your responsibility to refer to these Terms from time to time so that you may be informed of any such changes. Continued use of the Program following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy.
