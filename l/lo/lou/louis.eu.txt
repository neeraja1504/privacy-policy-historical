For reasons of transparency please note that we use the Google Tag Manager. This Manager does not record personal data. The Tag Manager rather makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. Tags are small code elements which are used, among other things, to measure traffic and visitor behaviour, record the impact of online advertising and social channels, set up remarketing and alignment with target groups or test or optimize websites.

The use of Google Maps takes place in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers and an easy retrievability of the branch locations displayed by us in the online shop.

Integration of the Trusted Shops Trust Badge: In order to display our Trusted Shops quality mark, the Trusted Shops Trust Badge is incorporated into the web page following an order. Trusted Shops products and any reviews collected are also displayed.
In balancing the various interests, this serves to safeguard our legitimate prevailing interests in the optimised marketing of our products. The trust badge and the services advertised are a product of Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Strasse 15C, 50823 Cologne, Germany.
Whenever a trust badge is called up, the web server automatically stores a so-called server log file which contains, for example, your IP address, the date and time of retrieval, the data volume transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the retrieval. This access data will not be evaluated and will be automatically overwritten at the latest seven days after your visit to the website.
Other personal information will only be transferred to Trusted Shops if you decide, after completing an order, to use Trusted Shops products or have already registered for their use. In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.
YouTube : This website uses the YouTube LLC function to embed YouTube videos. YouTube is an affiliated company of Google Inc. To display the embedded YouTube videos in an iFrame on our website, the “extended data protection mode” is activated. YouTube does not store any information about visitors to the website.

More information about the collection and use of data by YouTube and Google and your rights and options for protecting your privacy in this respect can be found in YouTube’s Privacy Policy: https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy.
Social plug-ins: In order to protect your data, we use a technical solution that ensures that data transfer via social plug-ins to the respective operator of the social network is not done without prior activation by you.

By logging out beforehand from social network sites as well as by deleting cookies already set, you can prevent social networks from assigning the information collected about you during your visit to our website to your user account at the respective social network. If you do not wish your collected data to be assigned to your profile on the respective social network, then you will have to log out of the social network before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent the plug-ins from being loaded by using add-ons for your browser, e.g. with the “NoScript” script blocker available at: noscript.net.
