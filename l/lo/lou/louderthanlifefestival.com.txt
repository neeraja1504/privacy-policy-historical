We use cookies to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Site[s]. For

Sites. Web beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that enable delivery of a graphic image
on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the
computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource

of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, Web beacons and similar technologies let us

that you voluntarily submit to participate in a Site activity. We have no control over the third party’s
use of this information.
