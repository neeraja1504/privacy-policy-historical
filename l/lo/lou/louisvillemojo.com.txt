Mojo Privacy Policy
1. Privacy Standards
Louisville Mojo respects your privacy. We will not disclose any personally identifiable information (PII) about you to other members without your express written permission, except as required by law, legal action, or as required by Louisvillemojo to enforce its Terms of Service and to prevent harassment and abuse on the site. If your actions are determined to be illegal or harassing to other site users, or your conduct is determined to be an abuse of the site, or in violation of our Terms of Service, Louisvillemojo may initiate its own legal proceedings, and/or may involve and share PII information with law enforcement.
2. Notice and Disclosure
Louisvillemojo may disclose to third parties certain information contained in your registration application. Depending on the level of your user account, Louisvillemojo may collect as little information as your IP address and user agent string, all the way up to the full amount of information that you have made available to Louisvillemojo through use of our software.
The user data collected by Louisvillemojo may be used for purposes of media auditing, site traffic verification and marketing partnerships with third parties. IP addresses may be used to troubleshoot and diagnose problems with our servers or software, as well as to ban and identify abusive users. For purposes of media auditing and third-party site traffic verification, Louisvillemojo reports to auditors who utilize Interactive Advertising Bureau compliant methodology.
We use third-party advertising companies and marketing partners to serve ads when you visit our Web site(s) and via email. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site, other sites, and via email, about goods and services that may be of interest to you (Louisvillemojo does not have access to this information). In the course of serving advertisements from this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. Users may opt-out of third-party information gathering to the extent provided by the Network Advertisers Initiative.

Due to our stringent privacy standards, Louisvillemojo does not allow users to opt-out of the minimal amount of information collection required for various levels of membership. If you no longer wish to have an account, please contact technical support to request that it be permanently removed.
We provide members the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email marketing communications using the "my account" link.
