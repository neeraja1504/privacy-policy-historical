Lowe's Home Improvement U.S. Privacy Statement
Lowe’s respects your privacy. This Privacy Statement describes how Lowe’s collects, uses, shares and protects information from and about our customers, visitors and job applicants, along with choices you can make about such information. It also contains other important privacy disclosures, such as how we may update the Statement and how you can contact us.
Scope
This Privacy Statement applies to your interaction with Lowe’s in our United States retail stores, as well as with our websites and mobile applications that point to this Privacy Statement. It covers the privacy practice of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and its US operating subsidiaries and affiliates (“Lowe’s”), except as outlined below.

In some cases we may provide additional details about privacy practices specific to a particular operation or location. For example, some of our websites may provide additional privacy details unique to that website, or some stores may post additional privacy details specific to that store or an event.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to:
Certain US subsidiaries, affiliates and product lines, which are subject to their own privacy statements and policies, such as Maintenance Supply Headquarters
Credit-related products (such as Lowe’s branded credit cards issued by banks), which are covered by the issuing banks’ privacy notices that appear on the credit applications or that you receive in connection with your credit accounts
Third-party websites that are linked to or accessible from Lowe’s websites or that are operated by unaffiliated parties, even though the website may contain references to Lowe’s. For example, it does not apply to sites such as Lowe’s Appliance Parts powered by Marcone, or Lowe’s Protection Plans powered by Assurant Inc., both of which are governed by their respective privacy notices at the bottom of the sites
Practices of our international subsidiaries and affiliates, such as Lowe’s Companies Canada ULC, or Rona Inc. and their subsidiaries, related entities and affiliates
Lowe’s employment-related records (other than job applicant information submitted through the Career Portal)

Information We Collect by Automated Means Online
When you use our websites or applications (“online services”), Lowe’s and our partners may collect certain information by automated means, using cookies and other technologies. This information may be used to provide a better-tailored shopping experience and for market research, data analytics and system administration purposes. For instance, we may use this information to determine whether you have visited us before or are new to our website, to store your preferences and settings, and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. We also may use this information to target custom content and ads to you on this and other websites, including as described in the Interest-Based Advertising section below.
Our online services may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings. Your browser may provide the ability to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.
These settings generally do not work for Flash cookies, but you may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel. Please note, however, that if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functions of our online services.
Our online services generally use web server logs to record information about your use of the services, such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, system settings and IP address, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. These logs also may record information such as the address of the webpage that referred you to our website and other information about your interaction with our websites, such as which pages you visit. This is a common practice that supports the operation of our online services.
Our webpages, emails and electronic newsletters may contain tags known as “web beacons” or “single-pixel gifs,” which are small electronic images used to help deliver cookies on our sites, count visitors to our webpages, determine whether emails are opened and deliver co-branded services. We may also work with other companies by sharing information about the use of our beacons or to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement or product on our sites results in a purchase or other action on other sites. Our webpages may also contain web beacons from third parties, which help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other website operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer.
We may also use third-party web analytics services, such as those of Google Analytics, in our online services. These service providers help us analyze how users use our online services. Information collected as a part of Google Analytics (including your IP address) is automatically sent to Google, and Google may place cookies to help with the analysis. To learn more about Google Analytics and download an opt-out browser add-on, please click here.
If you choose to install our mobile applications, we may collect certain information about your precise location, including your location when you are within our stores. You can control and change the mobile applications’ use of your location through your device’s operating system controls.
If you choose to connect your mobile device to the free in-store Wi-Fi available at Lowe’s stores, we may collect information about your device, such as the type of device, its operating system, browser type and applications that use the Wi-Fi connection. We may also collect information about how the Wi-Fi is used, including how long a device is connected and the nature of the use (for instance, whether the device is browsing the internet or using an app). We may also collect aggregate URL data and may block access to certain URLs.
Information We Collect by Automated Means Offline
When you call our customer service centers or other phone support lines, we may record audio of the conversations for quality control, training, security and analytics purposes.
We use video monitoring and recording at Lowe’s stores to enhance security; protect against theft and other crimes; monitor in-store traffic patterns, customer counts and interests; and perform similar analytics.
Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may obtain certain information about you from other businesses, such as updated addresses, phone numbers, consumer profiles and location data we obtain from vendors who maintain such data. We may also obtain information about you from individuals, such as through “Refer a Friend” programs or if someone purchases a product and asks that it be delivered to you. We may also obtain information from public sources, such as information you submit in a public forum (for example, a customer review).
We may also obtain information about you from Lowe’s affiliates.
How We Use Information
We use your personal information to provide products and services to you, communicate with you, and support our business functions, such as fraud prevention, marketing and data analytics.

Protect against and prevent fraud and unauthorized transactions; investigate and manage claims, risk exposure and quality; and generally improve and provide security
Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, industry standards, and our policies and terms, such as our Terms and Conditions of Use
We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties (companies outside the Lowe’s family) without your consent, except for conducting business with service providers and business partners, complying with legal requirements, and transferring of our business.
Service Providers and Business Partners
We may disclose your personal information to companies that provide services to us (such as providers of hosting, support, delivery, printing, email, data enhancement and repair services) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need access to information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are generally not authorized to use the information we disclose to them for any other purpose.
In limited cases, we may disclose information about you to a third party who may also use the information for their own specific purpose. For instance, we may provide information on your behalf to a supplier in connection with warranty or product safety issues, or with a business partner who is jointly providing a product or service to you or who is running a jointly branded promotion or a rebate program with us. We may also share limited information with the banks that issue Lowe’s branded credit cards and accounts so that they may offer such accounts.
Legal, Enforcement, Security and Investigation
We may disclose information about you (1) if we believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (2) as we deem appropriate or necessary in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities or tax authorities; (3) when we believe disclosure is appropriate or necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Lowe’s, our customers or others, including to prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or loss, or to collect debt you owe; or (4) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets
We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including, without limitation, in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
Aggregate or De-Identified Data
We may share or make public aggregate or de-identified data derived from personally identifiable information. Such information, however, will not identify you or any other individual.
How We Protect Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed and intended to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Despite these safeguards, due to inherent uncertainty in the use of the internet and information systems and the potential for unlawful attacks by third parties, we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites or applications will be completely safe or secure.
Information we collect and use may be transferred, stored and accessed globally to support our operations. We retain information for as long as it is needed or useful to provide and improve our products and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Where applicable, you may manage and amend your preferences regarding how we communicate with you as outlined in more detail below. We strive to comply with all reasonable requests, but there may be a short delay in the processing of such requests.

Other Important Considerations
Do Not Track
We do not do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser or other mechanisms that enable consumer choice regarding the collection of personal information about one’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. (To understand your choices, see above.)
Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising
We collect data about your activities on our websites and applications for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests, and we may share information about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties. These ad networks track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The information they collect includes information about your visits to our websites, such as the pages you have viewed. This collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as sites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. As a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activities on our websites and vice versa. We may also combine information about your online activities with your activity in a Lowe’s store using our mobile applications.
We may also utilize third-party services that may allow us to associate your prior Lowe’s online or in-store transaction data, operating system, user-agent string, IP address, internet browser, installed fonts and similar information with an anonymous ID, which can then be used to target Lowe’s advertising to you on other websites and online platforms. These services may use anonymous IDs that do not contain any personal information or otherwise identify you.
To provide you with a consistent shopping experience, we may also associate various devices you utilize (e.g., smartphones, tablets and desktop computers) by using information we collect about you. We may combine information we collect from your devices with other information we have about you, such as your Lowe’s account information; your interaction with our sites, apps and services; and your transaction history.
The DAA has created guidance for online advertisers and provided a mechanism for such advertisers to comply with users’ choices regarding interest-based ads. To learn more about ad networks, including how to opt out of interest-based ads, click here.
Our online services may include social media features (for example, a Facebook “Like” button). These features are connected to third parties and may allow such third parties to collect certain information, such as your IP address and which pages you visit on our websites. These social media features are not operated by Lowe’s. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing the features.
Links to Other Websites
Our websites may link to other websites for your convenience and information. For instance, they may link to websites of product suppliers, manufacturers and service providers. These websites may be operated by companies not affiliated with us. Linked websites, including those operated by Lowe’s, may have their own privacy notices, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit them. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website that we do not control and that does not point to this Privacy Statement. Your interactions with these websites are governed by the privacy policies of the company operating the websites.
Children
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so that the information can be deleted.
Notice to California Customers
Subject to certain limitations under California Civil Code § 1798.83, if you are a California resident and have an established business relationship with us, you may ask us to provide you with (1) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to certain third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (2) the identity of certain third parties that received personal information from us for their direct marketing purposes during that calendar year.
