Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet.

If, like LondonNet, you use Windows PCs we recommend a regular 'clean-up' of your cookies and 'temporary internet files'. Aside from the privacy issues discussed above, cleaning or clearing up these files will often help to speed up your PC. We use a neat, free package called CCLeaner every week or two on our machines. Yes, it means we have to re-enter a few passwords, etc but we like our PCs to hum along with a spring in their step.
Thank you for your time, and please feel free to contact us if you have any concerns relating to privacy when you visit the LondonNet.co.uk web site.
