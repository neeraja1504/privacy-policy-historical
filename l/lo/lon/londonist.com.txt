Cookies And Privacy Policy | Londonist
This privacy statement covers the website www.londonist.com. Please read this statement carefully before accessing our content. Your use of the Londonist website indicates your agreement to abide by the Terms in effect.
Londonist Ltd is committed to protecting your privacy, and keeping any personal data you share with us secure. Read on for more details about how we deal with data.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. You can learn more about cookies, and how to manage them, here: www.allaboutcookies.org
We collect some information from cookies to help us understand how you arrive on and navigate our website, as part of the basic functionality of our site. On Londonist.com we may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
3rd Party Cookies
Londonist utilises third-party software, such as Google Analytics, for statistics on our website usage, advertising and for social media plugin functionality.
Advertising and targeting cookies are also used, to help deliver advertisements which are relevant to you. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Please note that electing not to receive targeted advertisements does not mean you will receive fewer ads when you visit our site, simply that the ads you see will not be tailored to you.
Again, we recommend visiting www.allaboutcookies.org to learn more about how to manage your cookies.
Comments
In order to enhance their use of the Londonist website, users can choose to leave comments on particular articles of interest. The comments are managed via comment hosting service Disqus.
If a third party complains that a comment breaches our Terms of Service (e.g. libels them), then in accordance with our Terms, we will make reasonable efforts to contact the commenter and alert them to the situation. If we are required by law to disclose commenters’ contact information, we will attempt to contact commenters to give them the opportunity to respond to such requests.
Occasionally we may need to remove comments from the site: either for legal reasons that could get us and you sued (e.g. contempt of court, defamation) or if a comment falls outside the realm of civilised debate (e.g. abuse, offensive or inciting hatred). Our decision is final.
Mailing Lists
We run a series of mailing lists and email newsletters, ranging from our Things To Do In London guides through to our daily round-ups, and a selection of our most popular articles — you can read more about them here, on our subscriber page.
We hope you’ll love our emails. But if you want to stop hearing from us at any time, we’ll make it as easy as possible for you to unsubscribe from them. Simply hit the ‘Unsubscribe’ or ‘Unsubscribe all’ button at the bottom of an email, or contact hello@londonist.com with any requests or concerns that you have.
We don’t share your email address with third parties, except with services that allow us to send you email, like MailChimp, or with your clear agreement.
Surveys
We run regular reader surveys to make sure we’re staying in touch with what our audience wants from us. Information we ask for in these might include your age group, geographical location and socialising habits.
If you choose to take part in a survey — and we hope you will! — we guarantee only to use the information you share as part of anonymous, aggregated survey results to inform our content. Any unique identifiers at an individual level received from your survey answers will be deleted from our systems after three months.
Third Party Links, Websites and Services
Our site contains links to websites and content operated by third parties. Such links do not mean or imply that Londonist endorses, recommends, sponsors, or otherwise has any affiliation or relationship with any third party, and no affiliation or relationship should be presumed. Londonist does not control and is not responsible for any aspect of such websites and content, nor are they covered in our privacy policy; please make sure to read their privacy policies if you choose to click through to third party sites.
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyse user movement.
Business Transitions
In the event Londonist Ltd goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information may be part of the assets transferred.
Legal Disclaimer
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, Londonist Ltd may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on any Londonist Ltd website.
Notification of Changes
Whenever Londonist Ltd changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
Contact Information
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact the editor of the Londonist Ltd site in question, or send an email to hello@londonist.com or mail us at Londonist Ltd, 72-74 Paul Street, London EC2A 4NA, United Kingdom.
