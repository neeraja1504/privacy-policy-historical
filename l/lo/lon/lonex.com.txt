LONEX PRIVACY POLICY
PRIVACY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS
We use encrypted SSL connection to process your credit card information and DO NOT store any of your payment details in our system. The payments are carried out in the background by the PayPal payment processing gateway and go through the HSBC bank's terminal. Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of your payment. Not only do we NOT make a record of your credit card details in our system, but also - for maximum online security - we do NOT share this information with any third party.
PRIVACY OF YOUR ACCOUNT
We consider your registration data and the content of all your messages private and confidential. The header of the messages that you send will contain your name (e-mail address) and Internet Protocol (IP) address. We will not intentionally monitor or disclose any of your e-mail content or registration data unless we are required to do so:
to enforce these Terms and Conditions,
by law,
to defend ourselves in any legal action,
to protect our property.
Since your password is essential for protecting your privacy, we encourage you to NOT share it with anyone and change it frequently. Additionally, you agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others.
