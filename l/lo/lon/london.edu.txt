What information do we collect?
Our sites and services contain online forms that you can use to enquire about or apply for programmes, register for events, download brochures, and donate and pay online via SecureTrading.
To do this, our sites and services collect a range of information. Much of this is automatic and anonymous.
We will only collect personally identifiable information when we have your specific consent to do so. All personal data will be managed in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.

What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of text information that is sent by an organisation to your computer and stored on the hard drive. Cookies allow the organisation to recognise you.

persistent cookies remain on your computer for much longer (how long depends on the specific cookie).
Why does London Business School use cookies?
We use Google Analytics cookies and WebTrends cookies to help us analyse how our website is working and make it better.

What do we do with the information we collect?
Data we collect automatically is used only to help us measure the effectiveness of our website and plan new developments. This data is processed anonymously.
Personal information is used to give you the information or service you've asked for. We may also tell you about similar products and services provided by the School.
How do we keep information secure?
We're committed to protecting your data from:
unauthorised access
alteration
disclosure or destruction
accidental loss or destruction
To do this we have a number of solutions and procedures in place. These are reviewed periodically to make sure they are still effective and meet current best practice.
The School's Portal is protected by SSL (secure socket layer) technology. However we can't guarantee the security of personal information, in an email or an online form, while it's being transmitted to us across the internet.
When do we share information?
We don't rent, lease or sell your personal information to third parties.
There may, however, be times when we share data with third parties to perform specific services. These third parties are not allowed to use your personal information except to provide these services. They are also required to keep your data confidential.
We may also need to disclose your information if required to do so by law.
