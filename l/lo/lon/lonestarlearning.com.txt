This email will include the submitterís IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message.
Data Synced: Post and post meta data associated with a userís contact form submission. If Akismet is enabled on the site, the IP address and user agent originally submitted with the comment are synced, as well, as they are stored in post meta. Purchase events will send Google Analytics the following information: order number, product id and name, product category, total cost, and quantity of items purchased.
Data Used: When sharing content via ShareThis or email, the following information is used: sharing partyís name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content.

As a custodian of PII, LSL complies with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to the extent FERPA applies, in its handling of education records. Upon termination or cancellation of a Customer contract, LSL will delete all PII data from its records. LSL may retain aggregate, non-identifying usage information for the purpose of reporting, analytics, and improving LSL's products and services.
Upon our collection of your PII, LSL may use such information internally, separately or in combination with pre-existing information, for the following purposes:
To provide any requested services;
To troubleshoot problems with the Site, or any services, as requested;
To improve our products;
To customize your experience, content or homepage on the Site;
To enforce our Terms of Use;
To generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research; or
To provide any legitimate business service or product.
COOKIES
Cookies help us in many ways to make your use of the Site more enjoyable and meaningful, such as understanding usage patterns and improving functionality of the Site. Cookies are text information files that your web browser places on your computer when you use a website. LSL may use such “cookie” technology to obtain non-personal information from you.
LSL uses analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as Google Analytics Display Advertising  (Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our online Sites and/or Services. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, and other similar information. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings. In addition, you can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics. LSL relies on the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to develop the site and content around our users’ interests.
Third party analytics companies like DoubleClick who collect information on LSL Sites and/or Services and other online products and/or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page.
DATA SHARING AND TRANSFER
LSL will provide data and the personal identifiable information on users and the analysis of trends for all users on an aggregate basis to some or all of the following (collectively, the “Customer”): the LSL, a user’s school district, or a user’s school. LSL provides such information as a service to its Customer but it does not control the use of such data after it provides it to the Customer. Consequently, LSL takes no responsibility or liability for the use of such data after it provides it to the Customer.
LSL does not provide, sell or lend any personally identifiable information to any third party.
LSL reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information based on the good faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate to: (a) protect and defend the rights or property of LSL, or (b) act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety or security of the public or of users of LSL’s services and/or the Site.
Your personal information will generally be stored in LSL’s databases, which are located in the United States. Our policy is to ensure that your information is always granted the same level of protection no matter where it is stored.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
The Site contains links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers. These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such websites, unless we have otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to be aware when you are be redirected to a third party website and review the privacy policies of each website you visit and use.
SECURITY
LSL has a program designed to protect PII in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes, and procedures, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, security, and availability of the PII that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. While the security of users’ PII is of the utmost importance to LSL, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, LSL cannot guarantee its absolute security.
PAYMENT
LSL uses Square and PayPal to process and accept the payment-related information that they receive as necessary and appropriate to fulfill requests to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and to otherwise deliver payment services. Personally identifiable information about consumers is used by Square or PayPal to process payment transactions and for no other purpose. Square’s full privacy policy can be viewed here. PayPal's full privacy policy can be viewed here.
Square and PayPal all adhere to international PCI (payment card industry) compliance standards for data security. When payment is accepted directly by LSL, all credit card information is destroyed after processing.
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of 12 requirements that all businesses who handle credit or debit card payments must comply with. The PCI Security Standards require all merchants, regardless of size or number of transactions, who accept, store, transmit or process any cardholder data to comply with PCI DSS. You can find out more about PCI here.
