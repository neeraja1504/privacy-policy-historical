This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact us.
On today’s Internet where oftentimes anything goes, many companies out there use the guise of offering free stuff to collect and sell your data, send you spam, and even infect your computer with viruses, malware, and spyware. We hate spam, scams, and all that crap just as much as you do.
Your data is safe with us; we will never rent, sell, or share your data with anyone outside of our network (unless required by law), nor will we build a personal profile about you to track you for advertising purposes. That is our commitment to our members, a safe place to have the perfect Internet experience while receiving amazing rewards and benefits— UNICORN.
If you are joining UNICORN **** through an invite of another member, they will receive your name, email, and basic data in order to help you and keep you updated as needed.
All of our network and partner websites have committed to these same privacy standards, so you know that they are sites you can trust.
UNICORN Privacy Policy Details

By posting personal information online like in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
UNICORN **** has a ZERO TOLERANCE for SPAM; if you ever feel another member is spamming you, contact us immediately.
