(a) Lottoland reasonably believes that the recipient of Personal Information outside Australia is subject to principles of fair handling that are substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles; or
(b) the transfer is to a trusted third party, including but not limited to, our related companies (such as our parent company Lottoland Holdings Ltd), our professional advisers including lawyers and accountants, law enforcement bodies, courts of law or as otherwise required or authorised by law, regulatory or governmental bodies; or

However, where we do disclose your Personal Information to parties outside of Australia, Lottoland takes steps as are reasonable in the circumstances as to ensure that the information which it has been disclosed is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the Australian Privacy Principles.

In the event that the use or processing of your personal information involves the disclosure of any information outside Australia, you acknowledge and accept that by providing us with your personal information, you consent to such overseas disclosure.
