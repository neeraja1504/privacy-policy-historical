Interest
A lender may charge and collect interest in respect to a revolving credit plan or closed-end loan at such a daily, weekly monthly, annual, or other periodic percentage rate or rates as the agreement governing the plan or loan provides, or as established in the manner provided in such agreement. Periodic interest may be calculated on a revolving credit plan using any balance computation method provided for in the agreement governing the plan. Periodic interest may be calculated on a closed-end loan by way of simple interest or such other method as the agreement governing the loan provides.
If the agreement governing the revolving credit plan or closed-end loan so provides, the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest may vary in accordance with a schedule or formula. Such periodic percentage rate or rates may vary from time to time as the rate determined in accordance with such schedule or formula varies and such periodic percentage rate or rates, as so varied, may be made applicable to all or any part of the outstanding unpaid indebtedness or outstanding unpaid amounts. In the case of revolving credit, such rate shall become applicable on or after the first day of the billing cycle that contains the effective date of such variation. In the case of closed-end loan transactions, such rate may be made applicable to all or any part of the outstanding unpaid amounts on and after the effective date of such variation. Without limitation, a permissible schedule or formula hereunder may include provisions in the agreement governing the revolving credit plan or closed-end loan agreement for a change in the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid indebtedness or outstanding unpaid amounts, whether by variation of the then applicable periodic percentage rate or rates of interest, variation of an index or margin or otherwise, contingent upon the happening of any event or circumstance specified in the plan or agreement, which event or circumstance may include the failure of the borrower to perform in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit plan or loan agreement.
