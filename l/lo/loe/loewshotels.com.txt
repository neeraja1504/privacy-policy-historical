How Loews Shares Personal Information
Loews endeavors to provide the same level of service that Loews guests have come to expect at Loews whether they are in New York, Montreal, San Francisco or Orlando. To provide this service, Loews may share personal information among hotels or service providers.
Personal information provided in connection with a reservation is made available to the hotel in order to fulfill the reservation request. After the stay, the information, including stay details, room type, services, amenities used, etc. is retained. Loews may provide the hotel's owner and manager with limited information about past or future guests of that hotel.
To provide users a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, Loews may enter into agreements with select reputable third-party companies that sell Loews-branded products. Any personal information provided to these third parties will be controlled by each of them and is subject to their respective privacy statements and practices.
Billing and folio information for stays paid by corporate payment cards or accounts for guests whose employers or contractors participate in a corporate electronic billing or eFolio program will be shared with the payment card or account providers and the employers or contractors, or their agents. Once Loews transfers this information, Loews Privacy Statement will no longer apply and the handling of personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the employer, the relevant payment card or account network operator, the relevant card or account issuer and/or their respective subcontractors.
Information collected for meeting and event planning for stays or visits as part of a group event or meeting may be shared with the organizers of those meetings and events, and, where appropriate, guests who organize or participate in the meeting or event.
From time to time Loews may partner with other companies to provide products or services and may share information with Loews’ business partners to provide those products or services. For example, Loews may help to arrange rental car or other services from Loews’ business partners, and share personal information with Loews’ business partners in order to provide those services. Loews also may co-sponsor promotions, sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions or contests with other companies, or Loews may provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies. Loews may share entrants’ information with Loews’ co-sponsor or the third-party sponsor.
Loews may share personal information with providers of on-property and off-property services that provide services such as concierge services, spa treatments, golf, or dining experiences, such as the Julien Farel spa, the Rural Society restaurant, and more. These providers may also share information with Loews. Providers may have their own privacy policies and statements that govern their collection, use and sharing of information.
Loews relies on service providers to provide certain products and services, such as to facilitate administrative functions and information technology operations, payment card or account billing, reservations services, market researchers, email service providers, mail houses that process mail and communications for Loews, providing services in connection with the website, including airline and rental car packages; communicating news and delivering promotional and transactional materials via email, direct mail, and online and mobile advertising; processing payment card or account transactions, data hygiene and enhancement services; professional services such as accounting, auditing and legal advice; investigating accident reports; processing insurance claims; and administering sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions, contests and customer surveys. Loews will disclose personal information to service providers as appropriate.
In the event of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of all or a part of any hotel or its business or assets, joint ventures, and related business transactions, including in relation to audit or reporting and other regulatory requirements, Loews may, in its sole and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected, including, without limitation, Other Information and personal information, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.
Loews may share guests’ telephone numbers among Loews hotels, partners and service providers, for purposes of telemarketing. Loews may also receive telephone numbers from Loews’ partners, service providers or from other sources, which Loews may use for telemarketing purposes.
In addition, Loews may disclose personal information without the guest or user’s permission in order to: (i) comply with applicable laws, (ii) respond to governmental inquiries or requests from public authorities, (iii) comply with valid legal processes, (iv) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Loews, website and apps visitors, guests, employees or the public, (v) permit Loews to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that Loews may sustain, (vi) enforce website and apps terms and conditions, and (vii) respond to an emergency.
Special Programs
On occasion, Loews may offer programs, activities, events or promotions (“Special Programs”) that have specific terms, privacy notices and/or consent forms that explain how any personal information you provide will be processed in connection with the Special Program.
Some Special Programs may be offered jointly with third parties with whom Loews collaborates. In those cases, Loews may exchange data with third parties to deliver the Special Programs.
The terms that apply to a Special Program may reflect the data handling process of third parties. We strongly suggest you review the terms applicable to the Special Program before participating.
Other Information
When guests or users are visiting and interacting with the Services, Loews and third parties may collect Other Information (for example, a catalog of the site pages visited, and the number of visits to Loews’ sites).
Because Other Information does not personally identify the user, such information may be disclosed for any purpose. In some instances, Loews may combine Other Information with personal information. If Loews does combine any Other Information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by Loews as personal information in accordance with this Statement.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify data about visitors to our Services and use it for any purpose, including product and service development and improvement activities.

Protecting Personal Information
Because the security of personal information is important, Loews enables the use of Secured Socket Layer (“ SSL ”) browser transmission of personal information. If a user’s browser is SSL enabled, transmission of personal information to Loews online through the browser can be encrypted. Users can verify whether their personal information is transmitted using SSL encryption by confirming the symbol of a closed lock or solid key on the bottom bar of their browser window. Users can also verify that transmission of personal information is encrypted using SSL encryption by making certain that the prefix for the web address listed for that page has changed from “http” to “https”. If the appropriate symbol and the “https” prefix is not visible, a user should not assume that the personal information that they are being asked to provide will be encrypted prior to transmission. The personal information collected from users online through the Services is stored by Loews and/or Loews service providers on databases protected through a combination of physical and electronic access controls, firewall technology and other reasonable security measures. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information and Loews is not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Loews will also seek to require Loews’ affiliates and service providers with which Loews shares personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information shared by Loews. For online transactions, Loews uses reasonable technology to protect personal information provided to Loews via the Services. Unfortunately, however, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure.
