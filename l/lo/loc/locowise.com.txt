PROTECTING CHILDREN
As of April 21, 2000 the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. LocoWise Ltd is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. If you are under 13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information about yourself to LocoWise Ltd, this Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If LocoWise Ltd discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided LocoWise Ltd with personally identifiable information, LocoWise Ltd will immediately delete that child's personally identifiable information from the website.

LocoWise Ltd only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses.

No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a vitally important part of ensuring absolute transparency between companies like ourselves at Locowise, and our valued application users, who depend on us every day to measure and report on their social media performance.
The GDPR supersedes the 1995 Data Protection Directive. One of the most prominent changes, being that even if a company operates outside of the EU, regulation applies to how those companies market their products and services to EU citizens. All users of Locowise have the right to submit a complaint to the ICO you are unsure about how LocoWise Ltd is handling your personal data.
HOW LONG IS MY DATA RETAINED BY LOCOWISE?

LocoWise Ltd will keep all unsubscribed (free trial) user personal data (including First Name, Surname and Email Address) for a standard retention period of up to 24 months.
