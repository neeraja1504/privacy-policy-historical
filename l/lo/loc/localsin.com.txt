Further, Professional Members will have the opportunity to provide, at their discretion, additional information including, but not limited to, their area of specialization (i.e., massage, dancing, etc.), rates, services, and their targeted audience, as well as other discretionary demographic details as described above for Private Members.
C.  Business Members  – Business Members are Users who maintain an active business presence and avail themselves of the opportunity to be listed as a “Romantic Resource” on the SITE’s “Romance Map,” thus allowing their businesses to be pinpointed by all other Users.

V. How We Use Your Information
The primary use for Your information is to provide You with services You have requested and/or paid for. We also use Your information to deliver customized services to You; for Member support purposes; and for efforts to monitor and ensure against fraud. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively, is used in order to customize Our marketing efforts or to customize the use of Our SITE for an aggregate group of customers. We will not use the personal information of Users whose membership have expired or have been cancelled in order to market Our services to such individuals in the future. Rather, all such personal information will be retained indefinitely in the SITE’s protected database.
Please note, Members’ personal information collected – with the exception of billing information collected by the SITE’s third-party billing processor(s) – will not be shared with third-parties, and is only intended for use by the COMPANY. We generally will use Your information for the purposes for which You specifically provide it including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
Ensuring payment for subscription services;
Statistical purposes designed to ensure Users with the highest quality of products and services.
To initiate intermittent contact with Users regarding new features; other Users that are also present; and upcoming chat room events.
To initiate contact with Users upon registration for a particular type of Member account; upgrading of use to a premium account; and password recovery.
Notwithstanding, the SITE reserves the right to transmit the generalized behavioral information of SITE Users in order to provide SITE advertisers with the ability to target their advertising campaigns. No actual personal User information will be conveyed to third-parties as a result of this particular marketing practice.
VI. Special Cases
It is Our policy not to use or share the personal information about Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing You with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, We may disclose personal information about Members, or information regarding Your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in Our sole discretion, We believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:
1. To satisfy any laws, such as the United States’ Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Secured Communications Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Our Acceptable Use Policy or other User policies;
3. To operate Our Services properly;
4. To protect Ourselves, Our Members, and the general public. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if We are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
5. We will always cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party litigants, and others seeking information about Our end users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
VII. Transmittals From Us
As indicated in Section V, above, We may send You periodic announcements including, but not limited to, the details of Our existing and new programs. You may opt out of these announcements by either clicking an “Unsubscribe” link contained within an email, or by logging into the User’s account settings and selecting the option to revise email contact settings. If You opt out of these marketing emails, You may still receive system notices and other information that is specifically related to Your account. These system notices include, but are not limited to, notifications of the expiration of subscription services/packages. Indeed, the one true exception to the COMPANY’s ‘opt out’ policy, herein, is that Users will be unable to opt out of receive updating cellular applications consistent with the SITE’s GPS technology (referred to as “SW Updates”)
If You provide Your information to Us, use the SITE, and/or subscribe to any of Our services, You will have created a commercial relationship with Us.

Any information that You send via this internal messaging system is not secure, and is not considered to be private information. You should use caution when sending any personal information over the internal messaging system, and You should not transmit any information that You would not wish to see disclosed to the general public.
D.  Telephone Calls:  Telephone numbers may, due to technological issues, be transmitted and visible by recipients during telephone calls, although our system makes reasonable attempts to maintain privacy of callers’ telephone device numbers.
IX. Our Commitment to Data Security
We take measures, including use of encrypted Secure Socket Layers (SSLs), to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information, as well as through the account upgrading process. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems. Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals We are unable to guarantee that Our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.
Further, We do not provide User information to third-parties (aside from the SITE’s third-party billing processor, and generalize, non-personal, statistical information, as noted above); nor will We sell, rent or provide any of Your personal information to other entities such as SITE advertisers, or other companies selling services similar to this COMPANY’s services.
