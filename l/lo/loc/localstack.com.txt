LOCALSTACK continues to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access.

The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on LOCALSTACK.COM, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.
