3. WHAT ABOUT COOKIES, LOGS, AND WEB BEACONS?
Local Motors may set and access Local Motors cookies on your computer. You may
disable these cookies within your browser, but some portions of the Website may
require that your Local Motors cookies be enabled. When you use Local Motors
services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends
whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as
your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the
date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify

track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve
the quality of our site including offering customized content and advertising. This
Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by
Local Motors. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results
or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own
cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information
from you. Local Motors lets other companies that show advertisements on some of
our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of
their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or
other companies do not have access to Local Motors’ cookies. Local Motors may
use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Users, to let us know whether
and when the email was opened. No Personal Information is transmitted through
web beacons.
4. LOCAL MOTORS CARES ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY, AND DATA
INTEGRITY.
Because Local Motors is committed to preserving the confidentiality, integrity and
security of your Personal Information, we have implemented commercially
reasonable technical safeguards to help us accomplish the same. We cannot,
however, ensure or warrant the confidentiality, integrity or security of any Personal
Information, or that Local Motor’s safeguards will prevent the loss or alteration of
your Personal Information, that you transmit to Local Motors, and you do so at your
own risk. We use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to Personal
Information about you to our employees, contractors, and agents who we believe
reasonably need to come into contact with Personal Information to provide products
or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Local Motors processes Personal
Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with
this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We take
reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is accurate,
complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their
Personal Information whenever necessary. In no event will Local Motors be
responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure
to store any Personal Information. Please note that our third party service providers
are owned and operated by others, and they may have different safeguards in place
to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and security of Personal Information, that are
not subject to our control.
5. YOU CAN EDIT AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ANY TIME.
We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you,
including those described above. Information associated with your account will be
kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide
products and services.
You can review and edit your Local Motors account information at any time by
visiting your account profile page. We reserve the right to use and share your
Personal Information as provided for herein, but you may opt out and deactivate and
delete your Local Motors account at any time by canceling your account on the
account profile page. When you use Local Motors’ services, we make good faith
efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and either to correct
this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise
required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual
users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
corrected or removed before processing such requests.

disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your
continued use of the Website, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy Policy
