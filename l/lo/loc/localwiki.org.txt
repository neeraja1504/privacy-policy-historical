LocalWiki is committed to preserving your privacy and being transparent about how we use information collected through LocalWiki.org (the “Website”) and any other applications, functionality, or services offered by LocalWiki (collectively with the Website, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy describes how LocalWiki uses, collects, and shares information collected through the Services. By using the Services, you agree to and accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post changes on this page so be sure to check back regularly. We will also notify you by posting an announcement on the Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. Continuing to use our Services after any changes have been posted, constitutes your acceptance of any modifications to the Terms.
1.   Contributions
1.1 Public Content. In general, all content (pages, maps, files, etc.) on LocalWiki is public, including any contributions made by LocalWiki community members.  The history of every edit to content made through the Services is publicly displayed and retained indefinitely by LocalWiki. Even if an article is "deleted," a website administrator or volunteer may still see what was removed from public view. Aside from the rare times when LocalWiki is required to delete editing-history in response to a court order or legal process, there is no guarantee that permanent deletion will occur.
1.2 Individual Contributions. If you contribute or edit content on through the Services (“Contributions”), your Contributions will be visible to the public and may show up in search results of third-party search engines.  If you have registered an account with LocalWiki, your Contributions will be associated with your username.  If you have not registered with LocalWiki, your Contributions will be associated with your IP Address.

2.2 Username. You will also be asked to create a username, which will be used to identify when you are logged onto the Services, and to identify your Contributions to the Services. Again, your username will be visible to the public, and may show up in search results of third-party search engines.

3. Cookies
Cookies are small text files that LocalWiki can send to your browser for storage on your computer. Cookies make using the Services easier by saving your status and preferences and refreshing them every time you use the Services.

In order to clear this logon information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log out of your account. While many browsers allow you to change your settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent, LocalWiki recommends that you leave cookies enabled, as disabling cookies may prevent you from using and may interfere with some functionality of the Services.
