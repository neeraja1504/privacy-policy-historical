Privacy Policy - Localwise
Introduction
Localwise Inc., ("Localwise," "we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we describe the information we collect, how we use it, and when and with whom we share it. This Policy applies to all sites, mobile applications, and other online services (collectively, "Platform") made available by Localwise. This Policy applies only to information collected on or through the Platform. It does not apply to information collected or obtained by or through any other means (including, without limitation, information collected offline, in person, over the telephone and/or by mail, or from third parties outside the Platform). Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use.

Information We Collect
We collect information in multiple ways including when you provide information directly to us, when you permit third parties to provide information to us, and when we passively collect information from you, such as information collected from your browser or device.
We may collect information from you during your use or access of the Platform, such as when you: (a) register; (b) complete a personal and/or business profile; (c) post a job; (d) apply for a job; (e) share information about other users or businesses; (f) invite people or businesses to join the Platform; (g) participate in polls or surveys; (h) sign up for electronic newsletters or other electronic communication; (i) make a purchase; (j) fill out any forms; (k) enter a sweepstakes or contest; (l) register for a promotion; (m) transmit User Content; (n) otherwise communicate with us or other users through the Platform or, (o) authorize Localwise to connect your account to the account of a “Connected Site” (for example, Facebook or Google). This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the Privacy Policy applies to all use of the Platform.

You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of the requested information.
Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties
We may collect information about you or others through Localwise affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the Platform through Facebook or Google. If you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, connections, or contacts, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes."
Sites such as Facebook or Google have their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information including any information you make public, please consult the sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.
We may also collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third parties. For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information from third parties, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide.
Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected
Device/Usage Information. We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies (such as Google Analytics), may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform.

Location Information. When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of jobs near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver job advertisements or other advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly.

If you are under the age of sixteen (16), we strongly encourage you to use Localwise only with the knowledge of a parent or guardian.

Security
We employ appropriate security measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Localwise may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. While we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Platform cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Localwise is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.
Links to External Platforms
The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Localwise does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Localwise of those external websites. You acknowledge that Localwise is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Localwise is not responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of information you provide while visiting such external websites.

We may retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that Localwise will not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your Account.
Your Choices Regarding Email Communications
We may send periodic informational or promotional emails to you directly or through third party services.
