Internet Security
The Information We Collect From You When You Browse LFCU web site anonymously: There
are two ways that we gather information about you. First, we do track which pages of our site you
visit and note your IP address (as all web sites do automatically), but do not gather any
information about you as an individual. The general information we gather enables us to serve
you better by continually improving our site based on current use patterns. Second, we also
gather specific information from you when you're interested in our products and services. We
Respect Your Personal Privacy.
We Respect Your Personal Privacy
LFCU knows how important it is that sensitive information about you remains confidential. LFCU
will not exchange general tracking and IP address information collected by our web site with any
companies outside LFCU family of companies without your permission. As a LFCU
Accountholder, you'll receive from time-to-time, valuable product and service offers from us, from
our affiliates, and other well-established companies. We carefully develop these offers to meet
our standards and to assure that they reach Accountholders most likely to take advantage of the
opportunity. To do so, we gather information you provide on your application and from servicing
your home loans or other products and services that may indicate financing and investing
preferences to create marketing lists. We create these lists under conditions designed to protect
the privacy of your information.
Browser Security
Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of on-line
documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead of sending readable
text, both your browser and the web site's secure server encode all text using a security key. That
way, personal data sent to your browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to
decode in the unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for
encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure web site. There are two
grades of internet security: International grade encryption uses a 40-bit random number
negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This means that only one out of about
1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade
encryption uses a 128-bit key, so that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. LFCU site
uses the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your Internet connection.
How Do I Know If Security Is Operating?
Your Internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser connected to a web site using
the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the
usual "HTTP://" indicate that the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if
security is operating. For example, Netscape Navigator may display the icon in the lower left
corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit security is in effect, it shows the icon. Microsoft
Internet Explorer shows an icon in either case. Note that security may be operating without any
visible indication if the web page you are viewing employs frames (see below). If secure
transmission is not in effect or only part of a frame-based page is secure, Netscape shows the
"broken key" icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon. Most browsers can be set to give
you a pop-up announcement when you enter or leave a secure web page. In Netscape, these
settings are on the Security Preferences "General" tab. In IE, the setting is on the "Advanced" tab
when you select "Options" on the View menu.
Secure mode and frame based web pages.
Security may be operating without displaying any security icons (or Netscape may show the
"broken key" icon) if only part of a frame-based page is employing security. You can verify the
security of page within a frame by opening it in a new browser window. Both IE and Netscape
allow you to open a link in a new window by right clicking on the link and selecting that option
from the pop-up context menu. When a secure page is open in its own window, instead of being
viewed within a frame, you can then see the security icons provided by your browser as well as
the "https://" secure protocol prefix in the URL string.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The primary goal of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule is to give parents
control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information may
be used. LFCU does not provide online services or web pages directed to children.
