Privacy Policy
Loyola Press takes your privacy seriously. Our policy is clear: we collect no personally identifiable information about you when you use any Loyola Press website unless you provide that information to us. Unless we have your authorization or are required to do so by law or other extraordinary circumstances, we will not share with any third party the personally identifiable information that we obtain from you.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information we collect when you use any website provided by Loyola Press (including, but not limited to, LoyolaPress.com). This policy does not describe information collection policies on websites not provided by Loyola Press, including those linked to from any Loyola Press website. It also does not cover information you may choose to share with other users of any Loyola Press website.
The Information We Collect
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you other than that which you affirmatively choose to submit to us, such as your e-mail address, postal address and name.
From time to time we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit a Loyola Press website, such as the IP address of your computer, the time and date of your visit, the pages that you access, and the number of times you return to the website. This information is not used to identify you, but is used in the aggregate for Loyola Press’s internal marketing and similar purposes. This process may involve the automatic placement of a small, removable text file (commonly referred to as a “cookie”) on your computer’s hard drive.
How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect
We may use the personally identifiable information we collect to communicate with you from time to time on topics that we believe may be of interest to you and to provide you with the ability to share ideas with other users of a Loyola Press website. We may also use your contact information to notify you of the results of occasional contests that Loyola Press may sponsor.
You may notify us of any changes in your personal information, or request that such information be removed from our records by e-mail to websupport@loyolapress.com. Please be aware, however, that if you choose to have your personally identifiable information removed from our records, you will no longer be able to receive certain updated information from Loyola Press, or participate in various functions of the Loyola Press websites.
We may disclose information about you to third parties if we have a good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to legal claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Loyola Press or others.
Children’s Issues
No Loyola Press website is directed to children under 13 years of age, and children under 13 years of age shall not use any Loyola Press website to submit any personally identifiable information about themselves.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
Loyola Press may revise and update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you by email at the address we have on file if there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of any Loyola Press website after receiving notice of any changes in this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
Last Update
This Privacy Policy was last updated on, and is effective as of, October 13, 2008.
