Use of Cookies
The SmartRebrander Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on SmartRebrander, a cookie helps SmartRebrander to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, and so on.
