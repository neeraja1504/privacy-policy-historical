Privacy Policy
Return to Client Help
We take your privacy seriously.
What information we collect
To create an account we require your email address, username, business or real name, location, and password.
For Client accounts we collect basic billing information, but do not store credit card details.
Users may also enter additional information to their profile such as bio and website.
We collect overall information on our users through Google Analytics
What we do with it
We will use your email address to update you on site events such as new contests, or receiving a private message from another user. We will never share your email with any third parties.
We will never share your business or real name; we use this to generate a basic contract to transfer the ownership rights of the logo from designer to contest holder when the contest prize is paid.
Your location, profile information, and contest information is viewable publicly on the site.
We use information generated form Google Analytics to learn more about site visitors, and to improve the site based on these findings.
