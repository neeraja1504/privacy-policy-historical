THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect information you provide to us, including personally identifiable information, in the course of using, engaging with, or otherwise interacting with our products, services, and programs. Through this interaction you can, among other activities, subscribe to one of our products (such as newsletters or magazines); request information from us or one of our trusted partners; engage in various activities like entering contests or sweepstakes, registering for webinars or in-person events, responding to surveys, voting in polls or otherwise expressing an opinion; or participate in one of our online forums or communities.
We may also collect information about your personal or professional interests, opinions and/or your use of various products, services and programs. For example, we may ask you to provide your job responsibilities or the industry in which you work to qualify for a free magazine subscription.
In some cases you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person’s name, company information, and mailing or email address to nominate the person for an industry award.
In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we, our partners, advertising networks, advertisers or other third party service providers may also collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages, open our emails, or engage with any of our other products or services. This includes such information as type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, your device identifiers, your internet service provider, location-based information, and the content you interacted with, viewed, or accessed. This data may be combined and linked with data from other sources.
For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google display network ads using the Ads Settings. Visitors may also opt-out of additional data collection via the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. Third-party vendors show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our websites.
HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION
We use the personal information that you provide to us to provide products, services and programs to you. As part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. You may unsubscribe from newsletters and other email communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you are no longer interested in.
From time to time we may contact you (or permit selected third parties to contact you) to notify you of special offers or other products, services, programs, or events. By providing your email address and/or phone number you consent to us contacting you by email or telephone.
The information we collect is also used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website.
We may offer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, editorial features or other offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by or presented with identified third parties. By participating in such activities or offerings, your IP address and the personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit may be provided to third parties we trust. Peerless Media LLC does not control the third parties’ use of this information. Generally, we will let you know at the time of collection if a product is sponsored. If you wish to change your contact preferences with an individual exhibitor/sponsor, please follow their own unsubscribe request details. Unsubscribing with Peerless Media LLC stops Peerless from sharing your information with third parties and from contacting you about issues not related to your subscriptions, but it does not affect any third-parties with whom we have shared your information from contacting you. In order to unsubscribe from communications from third parties, you must do that directly with the third-party company.
Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may disclose your personal information to selected third parties outside Peerless Media LLC for purposes associated with payment processing, the supply of products or services, for website administration or elsewhere when you have consented to such disclosures. These third parties are contractually bound to use personal information only to perform the services that we hire them to provide.
In addition, we make available sponsored content, and content provided to us from third parties. In return for access to this content, your personal information may be shared with those third parties, and the information will be governed by those parties’ privacy policies as well as ours. Peerless Media LLC does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties. If you do not wish to have your information shared with a third party, please do not access sponsored or third party content on our site.
We may also disclose personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
Finally, we may also share your personal information to any successor pursuant to an asset sale, merger, consolidation, restructuring, reorganization, liquidation or other similar transaction involving Peerless Media LLC or this Site.
ACCESSING/CORRECTING/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION
You may view and update information that you previously submitted to Peerless Media LLC by sending us an e-mail through the e-mail link provided above or writing to us at the above address. Current subscribers and registrants can also access and change their information by selecting the appropriate link in the email product, or on the website where their current subscription/registration resides. A request to change information may not be accommodated if the request conflicts with legal requirements or could result in incorrect information. Requests to view or change personal information may take a few days to process.
