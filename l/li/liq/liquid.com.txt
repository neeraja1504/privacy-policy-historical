4 COOKIES POLICY
4.1 Description of Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used
to allow websites to work properly or more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the
website.
There are two general categories of cookies. “First-party cookies” cookies are set directly by us. “Third-party
cookies” are set by a third party, and that third party can recognize your computer both when it visits the Sites
and when it visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps.
v1.02 (2018.09.04)
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are “session
cookies”, which exist only while your browser is open and expire once you close your browser. Other cookies
are “persistent cookies”, which survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize
your computer when you open your browser and browse the internet again.
More information on cookies and their use can be found at www.aboutcookies.org or
www.allaboutcookies.org.
4.2 Why We Use Cookies
When you access our Services, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your computer or other
device. These technologies help us better understand user behavior and inform us about which parts of the
Sites people have visited.
We use cookies to:
•   track traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with the Sites;
•   understand the total number of visitors to the Sites on an ongoing basis and the types of internet
browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g. Windows or Mac OS)
used by our visitors;
•   monitor the performance of the Sites and to continually improve them;
•   customize and enhance your online experience; and
•   enable us and third-party to advertise both on and off the Sites.
4.3 Categories of Cookies We Use
We use the following categories of cookies:
•   Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary because they enable you to move around our
Sites and use certain features on our Services. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to
access secure areas. Without these cookies, some Services cannot be provided.
•   Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our
Services so we can provide relevant content to you. For example, a functionality cookie can remember
your preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username.
•   Performance/Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how you use a website. For
example, a performance/analytics cookie will collect information about which pages you go to most
often, how much time you spend on that page, or if you get error messages from certain pages. These
cookies do not gather information that identifies you. The information these cookies collect is
anonymous and is only used to improve how our Services work.
•   Advertising and Tracking Cookies: Our Sites may feature advertising. We may allow third party
companies, including advertising companies, to place cookies on our Sites. These cookies enable such

In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive or device, clear gifs are embedded
invisibly on web pages. We and our third-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated
above (under "4.2 – Why We Use Cookies"), but primarily to help us better manage content on our Services by
informing us which content is effective.
