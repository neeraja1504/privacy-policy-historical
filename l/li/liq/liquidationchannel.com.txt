Personal Information
Your transaction history and the information you provide to us voluntarily on our site is stored in our customer database along with the customer information received from other sources. Some of the information we solicit, such as e-mail address, is voluntary, while much of it is required in order to fulfill your order properly. In addition to fulfilling your orders, we use the information that you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping and improving our services.
As is common practice, we may occasionally share your personal information with companies we work with to assist us in providing existing and greater services to our customers.
Our site presently does not store your credit card information, and any of your credit card information that may be stored in other Shop LC systems is protected by firewalls. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
E-MAIL POLICY
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and those who voluntarily include their e-mail addresses when ordering online. We may also collect your e-mail address if you provide it in the process of completing survey information or registering for online contests or sweepstakes. We cannot obtain your e-mail address unless you voluntarily provide it to us, or we obtain it from a service company that has confirmed your willingness to distribute it. Our Web server recognizes the computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, but not the e-mail address, for each visitor to our home page.
Contest registrations may involve sharing your e-mail address with our promotional co-sponsors -- please see the specific contest rules & regulations for details. Additionally, if you submit your e-mail address to Shop LC as part of a transaction originating with one of the companies we do business, the e-mail address may be shared by both Shop LC, and the company we do business with. So therefore please see the specific privacy policy, accessible from the other company's site, for details.
Other than the exceptions noted above, Shop LC will not sell, share or otherwise distribute your e-mail address. Any e-mail address supplied directly to Shop LC with respect to online orders, phone order, and requests for other information will remain in the sole possession of Shop LC.
If you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from Shop LC in the future, please use our unsubscribe form to remove your name from our list, or let us know by contacting us at 1 877 899 0078.
