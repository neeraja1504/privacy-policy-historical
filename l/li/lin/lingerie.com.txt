BareWeb Interactive, Inc. ("BareWeb", "us", "our" or "we") has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the website Barenecessities.com which is owned and operated by BareWeb and any successor websites, (the “Site”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications (the Site and other BareWeb interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the BareWeb Applications"). This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information. BareWeb provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use, continue to use the services provided by BareWeb and/or assessed through the BareWeb Applications or offline ("Services"). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (1) the BareWeb Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic catalogs and newsletters; (3) offline means such as direct mail, telephone and postal mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us or our products and services.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use. Each time that you access or use BareWeb Applications or our Services you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the BareWeb Applications or Services.
I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Connecting with the BareWeb Applications and Information Provided by You
Providing Information To Us. When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about BareWeb using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
Registration Information. We will collect personal information from you if you register on our Site or place an order ("Personal Information"). You may not use a user/account name that is vulgar or otherwise offensive (as determined by BareWeb), infringes any trademark or other proprietary rights of others, or is used in any way that violates the Terms. BareWeb reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the BareWeb Applications or Services without notice for any or no reason.
Billing Information. We collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards.
Surveys and Promotions. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey, including the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of BareWeb Applications.
Facebook. You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the BareWeb Applications or take advantage of other features of the BareWeb Applications. When you comment on the BareWeb Applications using your Facebook username and password and clicking "allow" on the Facebook permission authorization screen, you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Facebook user ID, your basic Facebook profile information and any other information from your Facebook profile that you specifically allow us to access. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted solely through Facebook.
User Generated Content. The Services may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Site (the “Communication Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, BareWeb. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that BareWeb Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.
**
Information Collected Through Technology
**
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the BareWeb Applications ("Usage Information"). This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the BareWeb Applications, all of the areas within the BareWeb Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use the Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance, or otherwise improve the BareWeb Applications. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the BareWeb Applications (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the BareWeb Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with personally identifiable information, we will treat it as Personal Information.
A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the BareWeb Applications. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the BareWeb Applications. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our BareWeb Applications, to monitor how users navigate the BareWeb Applications, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the BareWeb Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the BareWeb Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
HTML5. We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iphone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across websites but are not stored in browers' cookie files. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
Web Logs. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the BareWeb Applications. We may track your movement within the BareWeb Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our BareWeb Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our BareWeb Applications and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our BareWeb Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
**Information You Provide About a Third Party **
If you send someone else a communication from the BareWeb Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the BareWeb Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
**Information We Collect From Third Parties **
We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
**Third Party Analytics Technologies and Software Providers **
We use third parties’ analytic tools to better understand who is using the BareWeb Applications, how people are using the BareWeb Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the BareWeb Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the BareWeb Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other web sites you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with BareWeb Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.
Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the BareWeb Applications. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the BareWeb Applications. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, click here. To learn more about how Google use cookies in advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy located here . You can opt out of receiving interest-based Google Ads, or customize the Ads Google shows you, by clicking here.

Our Advertising. We also use third-party ad servers and ad networks to serve our advertisements when you leave the Site. These companies and the advertisers themselves may use information about your visits on other web sites and our Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to our Site, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens. They may also use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. We may also use information collected using third party cookies and Web beacons on BareWeb Applications and in our emails to deliver advertising about our Services displayed to you on third party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers, ad servers or ad networks. You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on our Site to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices. In addition, some of the ad servers and ad networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on our Site from ad servers and ad networks, you may continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but it will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of our Site and/or third party websites.

Browser Do Not Track Signals. Some third party browsers provide "do not track" machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result we do not respond to these signals. Go to www.networkadvertising.org or www.aboutads.info if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements.
Co-branded Areas. Certain areas on our BareWeb Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as sponsors or advertisers which provide products and or services, such as digital wallets, payment services, shipping services or rewards programs (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you.

Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. If you do not want us to send you emails regarding special promotions or offers or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you emails about their products and services, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those emails or you can click here to manage your email marketing preferences.
