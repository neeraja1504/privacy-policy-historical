We will only conduct these data transfers where the service provision and time-zone of the language your request requires it to processed by a local third-party linguist or Lingo24 subsidiary hub.
Where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure the party has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with relevant Data Protection Legislation.
