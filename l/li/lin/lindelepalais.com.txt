9.3 The Vendor will make the refund in euro, using the same method of payment as used by the customer to make the purchase. When there is no correspondence between the recipient of the item stated on the order form and the person who paid for the purchase, the sum will be refunded by the Vendor, in case of exercise of the right of withdrawal, to the person who made the purchase.
9.4 The Vendor will state the courier to use to return items (UPS, DHL, etc.). Using a courier service, stating the authorisation number for the return, as provided by the Vendor, the customer may return items to the Vendor without paying the additional costs directly. According to the methods and terms set out for exercise of the right of withdrawal, this method will allow Vendors to make direct payment, on the customer’s behalf, of the costs for returning the purchased items, freeing them of all obligation to make direct payment to the courier.
