Correcting, Updating or Removing Your Information
At any time, members can correct, update, or remove any of their personal information (except their birthday) by logging into their account and accessing the “Edit Profile” feature. Our customers support staff can assist them as well.
How We Use the Information
We collect the personal information listed above so that we can provide you with personalized features and an enhanced and efficient web site experience. We usually retain this information so you can, for example, view messages you have already read or check campaign dates you are already aware of. You understand and acknowledge that copies of your User Content may remain viewable in cached and/or archived pages or if other members have copied and/or stored your User Content, even after your information has been removed.
When you sign up as a member to the network, you create your own profile. Your profile information, including your name and your photo are displayed to other members in the network so that you may interact and communicate with them. On occasion, we may use your name and email address to send you notifications about the network’s new services, promotional items, merchandise, band news, and transactions involving your accumulated points. Generally, you may opt out of such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the email. However, the network expressly reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.
Without identifying you as an individual, the network may provide third parties with information contained in your profile for data gathering purposes (ex: gathering data on how many members like both band A and band B so that personalized advertisements, promotions, etc. can be sent to those particular members). We believe that this information gathering allows each member to get the most out of the network’s benefits—e.g., the distribution of band information that, based on your profile, matters to you.
Sharing Your Information with Third Parties
This web site is about sharing information with others of your choosing, and a limited number of third parties, to enhance each member’s promotional and informational-sharing experience. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, the network does not disclose personal information to any third party unless the network believes that disclosure is necessary to:
Enforce the network’s Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement;
Protect the network’s rights;
Coincide with legal requirements (ex: responding to a subpoena, search warrant, or any other legal process served upon Wonderful Union™). We will not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that the law enforcement information and/or private litigant request meets the applicable legal standards;
Protect the safety of it’s members; or
Enhance each member’s promotional and informational-sharing experience.
The network may provide services jointly with other companies and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that service.
Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you that allows access based on the privacy settings.
Wonderful Union™ expressly reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires the rights to that information as a result of the sale of Wonderful Union™, or the sale of a substantial portion of its assets to that successor in interest.
