Our Sites may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Sites and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other websites you used prior to coming to the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the
Google Analytics Terms of Service

How do you keep Personal Information secure?
Lindt takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect information transmitted via our Sites. Our Sites are scanned regularly for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your use of our Sites as safe as possible.
Nevertheless, because no Sites are impenetrable, we cannot guarantee that information that users of the Sites may transmit or otherwise supply will be totally secure.
How long do you keep Personal Information?
We hold onto different types of data as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you requested, or for another legitimate purpose such as complying with legal obligations. Because the needs vary based on different data types, retention periods may vary significantly.
For example, we may keep information about you and how you use our Sites as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm as described in the How We Use Information section.
