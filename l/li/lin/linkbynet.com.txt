DATA SECURITY AND RECIPIENTS
Linkbynet undertakes to ensure the protection and security of personal data that you choose to communicate, in order to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and prevent your personal data from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorized parties.
Linkbynet maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation and destruction.  As part of those safeguards, Linkbynet employs sophisticated technology designed to protect personal data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.  However, while Linkbynet strives to protect your personal data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, Linkbynet can not guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of personal data transmission which is beyond Linkbynet’s reasonable control.
Since all personal data is confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and agents of Linkbynet or Linkbynet Affiliates who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All the people who have access to your personal data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and subject to disciplinary actions and/or other sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations.

You are responsible for the confidentiality of your password and information appearing on your account. Consequently, you must ensure that you log out of your session in the event of shared use of a computer.
BINDING CORPORATES RULES (BCR)
Safeguarding the privacy and security of personal information is a top priority for Linkbynet in our data driven-economy. Linkbynet has become one of the world’s first enterprise IT management provider to secure EU accreditation for its Data Privacy Binding Corporate Rules as both a Controller and Processor of personal data.
The BCR certification has been approved by the European Data Protection agencies. The approval covers both Linkbynet’s handling of personal data (Controller) as well as the personal data it handles on behalf of its customers (Processor).
The Linkbynet’s BCR Policy is incorporated into a corporate wide policy, requiring all Linkbynet entities, employees and third party providers to comply with and respect the BCR Policy which is governing the collection, use, access, storage and transfer of personal data among Linkbynet entities and third-party sub-processors worldwide.
The BCR Policy applies to all personal data of past, current and potential employees, customers, resellers, suppliers, service providers and other third parties wherever it is collected and used in conjunction with Linkbynet business activities and the administration of employment.
Linkbynet will apply the BCR Policy universally in all cases where Linkbynet processes personal data, whether the personal data relates to European individuals or not, even though EU data protection laws only apply to personal data collected in Europe.
If you have any questions regarding the provisions of the BCR Policy, your rights under the BCR Policy or any other data protection issues, you can contact Linkbynet’s Data Protection Officer at the address below (see « Contact Us ») who will either deal with the matter or forward it to the appropriate person or department within Linkbynet.
