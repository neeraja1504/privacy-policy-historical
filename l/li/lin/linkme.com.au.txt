Legal basis for using your personal information
For EU/UK individuals:
If you are an individual who is either based in or a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom, we will only collect, use and share your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. We will make sure that we only use your personal information for the purposes set out above and in Appendix 2 where we are satisfied that:
you have provided your consent to us using the data in that way; or
our use of your personal information is necessary to perform the Services under the Terms and Conditions which you have executed with us or in order to take steps at your request prior to your entering into those Terms and Conditions with us; or
our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to; or
our use of your personal information is necessary to support the 'legitimate interests' that we have as a business, provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights. In all such cases, we will look after your information at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to object to this processing as explained further in Appendix 2.
If you would like to find out more about the legal basis for which we process personal information, please contact us.
Direct marketing
We may use your personal information to send you direct marketing communications about the Services or our related services. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements This may also include email communications, including information that we think may be of interest to you, and information on upcoming changes or improvements.
In most cases our processing of your personal information for marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests, although in some cases (such as where required by applicable laws or where we use or process any of your Sensitive Personal information or Sensitive Data) it may be based on your explicit consent. You can find out more on how we process your Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Information above.
You have a right to prevent direct marketing of any form at any time - this can be exercised by following the opt-out links in electronic communications, or contact us. When you receive any permitted electronic marketing communications from us, you may opt out of receiving further marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided in the communication. Please specify whether you would like us to stop all forms of marketing or just a particular type (e.g. email).
You can also change the way your browser manages cookies, which may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the settings on your browser. See further our Cookies section above and our Cookies Policy.
For EU/UK individuals: When and how we carry out profiling and automated decision making
We do not conduct any automated decision-making on your personal information. We may use limited profiling or other forms of automated processing for:
security purposes only to assess if your account may be fraudulent, a spam account or suspect in any way;
the purposes of marketing, and where this is completed we undertake to do this to pursue our legitimate interests of ensuring our marketing communications are relevant to you, its audience and persons to whom it is targeted.
As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.
Please note, you have certain rights (including a right to object) in respect of automated decision making, where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. See below for more information about your rights.
Accessing, correcting and updating your personal information
To request access to personal information we hold about you, please contact us. If that information is incorrect, out of date or incomplete, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When requesting access or changes to your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request.
There are some circumstances in which we are not required to give you access to your personal information. We may reject requests that are unlawful, frivolous, vexatious, unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing existing practices), that we believe risk the privacy, health or safety of others, or would be otherwise be extremely impractical (for example requests concerning information on our backup systems or unique ID data on Users).
Where we provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where in our opinion it would require a disproportionate effort or cost for us to do so. We may require you to meet our reasonable costs in providing you with access including for photocopying and postage.
Where you correct, update or otherwise provide personal information, you represent to us that the information you provide to us is, having regard to the circumstances, accurate, up to date and complete, having regard to the purposes of the disclosure, and not misleading or deceptive. We will respond to any requests to change your personal information within a reasonable timeframe and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold about you remains accurate, up-to-date and complete.
For EU/UK individuals
If you are an individual based in or a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom, there are additional rights to your personal data available to you. Please see below your detailed rights including rights of access, erasure, rectification and portability of your personal data.
Right  |  What this means
---|---
Access |  You can ask us to:
confirm whether we are processing your personal information;
give you a copy of that data;
provide you with other information about your personal information such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from, to the extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Privacy Policy.
Rectification  |  You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.
Erasure  |  You can ask us to erase your personal information, but only where:
it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or
you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or
following a successful right to object (see 'Objection' below); or
it has been processed unlawfully; or
to comply with a legal obligation to which LiveHire is subject.
We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary:
for compliance with a legal obligation; or
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Restriction  |  You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal information, but only where:
its accuracy is contested (see Rectification), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or
the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or
it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.
We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where:
* we have your consent;
* to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
* to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
Portability  |  You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format but case only where:
the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you; and
the processing is carried out by automated means.
Objection  |  You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our 'legitimate interests' as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.
International transfers  |  You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Economic Area. We may redact data transfer agreements or related documents (i.e. obscure certain information contained within these documents) for reasons of commercial sensitivity.

We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

Information we share / disclose to other parties
We do not share your personal information with any other Person unless one of the following circumstances applies:
Customers : we share personal information with our Customers, including user profile details such as your full CV, verification details, LinkedIn or Facebook data, and other personal data you have provided when you apply to connect to or accept an invitation to connect from a Customer or join a LiveHire talent community (a ' Connection ').

If you are a UK/EU individual based in or resident in the EU/UK, when a Customer contacts you or requests additional information from you for its own purposes (for example for the purposes of inviting you for interview for a role), the information you provide directly to Customer pursuant to such request will be held and processed by that Customer in accordance with their own privacy policy and terms. You should therefore request a copy of and familiarise yourself with the terms and privacy policy of any Customer with whom you wish to engage further.
Third Party Service Providers : we provide your information to Third Party Service Providers to help manage our business and deliver services. These include IT service providers who help manage our IT and back office systems including the hosting and storage of personal data, as well as email and SMS service providers. Some of these providers use 'cloud based' IT applications or systems, which means that your personal data will be hosted on their servers, but under our control and direction.

To this end:
although LiveHire is not currently part of a group of companies, we will ensure that in the event that LiveHire becomes part of a group of companies at any time, any transfers of your personal information between members of this group of companies will be covered by an agreement (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that personal information it receives is adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the group of companies;
where we transfer your personal information outside any future group of companies or to third parties who help provide our Services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the EU / US 'Privacy Shield' for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States and /or the use of EU approached Standard Contractual Clauses (' EU Model Clauses ') for controller to controller and /or controller to processor transfers from the EU /UK to jurisdictions, such as Australia and/or New Zealand, the United States, the Philippines and Singapore, who do not have an adequacy finding from the EU Commission ; and/or
where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information are disclosed.

Some information about you may be recorded in paper files that we store securely. Our information storage is on secure computers in locked information centres and data is encrypted, wherever possible. However, as the transmission of information across the internet is not completely secure we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our website and issues can arise.
We will also take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information once we no longer require it for the purposes for which it was collected or for any secondary purpose permitted under the Australian Privacy laws and/or other applicable data privacy laws.
We recommend that you create a secure password, do not disclose your password and account details to anyone, and that you change your password each month.

requiring all employees to comply with internal information security policies and keep information secure;
requiring all employees to complete training about information security; and
monitoring and regularly reviewing our practices against our own policies and against industry best practice
Enforcement and complaints

We hope it won't ever come to this, but if you've already contacted us and feel that your complaint cannot be resolved between us, you can contact the relevant local data protection supervisory authority (i.e. your place of habitual residence, place or work or place of alleged infringement). In Australia, this is the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). We will work with the appropriate regulatory and supervisory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal information that we cannot resolve with you directly.
Please note, you may choose to contact us in relation to a particular matter on an anonymous basis or using a pseudonym and, unless it is impracticable for us to do so or we will not be able to respond reasonably to your complaint, we will attempt to resolve your enquiry on such basis.
Changes
We may review or update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Revised versions will be available on the Website and will apply to your use of the Website, the Platform and the Services from the date of publication. Please regularly check these pages for the latest version of this notice. Any changes will take effect as soon as we publish the new Privacy Policy but there we have already collected information about you, we may take additional steps to inform you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy, including by posting on the Website, through pop-up notices or via email.
These policies are published by and remain the property of LiveHire Ltd (ABN 59 153 266 605).
