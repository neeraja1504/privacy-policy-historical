E. Our Security
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect personal information relating to you, we cannot guarantee the security of such data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received personal information relating to you, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
All information you provide to LinkConnector is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions carried out by us or our chosen third-party provider of payment processing services will be encrypted industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring or receiving personal information, such as SSL technology. The safety and security of your information and any personal information relating to you also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the Website and/or the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, considering the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us using the contact details provided in Questions & Concerns.
LinkConnector accounts require a username and password to log in. Customers must keep their username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in a Customer’s LinkConnector account is so sensitive, account passwords are hashed, which means we cannot see a Customer’s password. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only provide Customers with instructions on how to reset them.
We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our Customers and Visitors share with us.
Access to any of our data is via a Username and Password by Affiliates and Merchants, or by authorized LinkConnector employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy will be subject to our normal disciplinary process and subject to dismissal.
F. International Transfers
i. We operate in the United States
Our secure servers and offices are located in the United States, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States. While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take extraordinary steps to protect your privacy.
ii. Customers, Users, and Visitors located outside the United States
If you are someone who lives outside the United States:
Where we say we assume an obligation about Personal Information, we are also requiring our subcontractors to undertake a similar obligation, where relevant.
We will not use or disclose Personal Information for the purpose of our direct marketing to you unless you have consented to receive direct marketing; you would reasonably expect us to use your personal details for the marketing; or we believe you may be interested in the material, but it is impractical for us to obtain your consent. You may opt out of any marketing materials we send to you through an unsubscribe mechanism or by contacting us directly. If you have requested not to receive further direct marketing messages, we may continue to provide you with messages that are not regarded as “direct marketing” including changes to our terms, system alerts, and other information related to your account.
Our secure servers are located in the United States. In addition, we or our subcontractors may use cloud technology to store or process Personal Information. It is not practicable for us to specify in advance which country will have jurisdiction over this type of activity.
If you think the information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, we will take reasonable steps to correct that information upon your request.
G. Retention of Data
We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so. Our retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we’ll refer to these criteria to determine retention period:
Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.
Whether the data is necessary to provide our Services.
Whether our Customers can access and delete the data within their LinkConnector accounts.
Whether our Customers would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until their LinkConnector accounts are closed or terminated.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
H. California Privacy
Under California Law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (a) a list of the categories of Personal Information, such as name, email, and mailing address, and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes, and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please contact us using the contact details provided in Questions & Concerns.
