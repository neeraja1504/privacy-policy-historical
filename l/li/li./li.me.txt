At Lime and our family of companies (collectively “ Lime ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”) we are strongly committed to transparency, and we want you (“ you ” or “ your ”) to understand how we collect, use, share and protect your information. This Privacy Notice (“ Privacy Notice ”) describes how Lime handles information in connection with Lime’s websites and related mobile applications and services (collectively, the “ Services ”), and when you otherwise interact with us. When specified, this policy also describes our data practices related to Juicers. Please also read our Terms of Service which set out the terms governing the Services.
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If Lime makes changes to this Privacy Notice, the updated Privacy Notice will be made available through our Services and if we make any material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will provide a prominent notice and may also contact you directly by email or another method.

For example, to show you Lime bikes or scooters near your location, it is necessary to collect and record the physical location of your device. Data such as the location of the bike or scooter, the routes taken by the bike or scooter, and its rental status are also necessary to provide the Services. Lime also collects location data directly from Lime bikes or scooters including when a Lime user is riding, such as journey information.
