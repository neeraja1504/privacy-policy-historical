Cookies, Pixel Tags and Similar Technology
What are they? Cookies and pixel tags are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies and pixel tags make internet browsing easier for you by saving your passwords, preferences and preferred websites as you browse. The use of cookies and pixel tags are an industry standard – you will find that they are used by most major websites. By showing how and when visitors use the Sites, cookies and pixel tags can also help website developers see which areas are popular and which are not and can help you find information that is most relevant to you based on your search history. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. If you reject cookies, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or receive a promotion tailored to you. The Sites do not control and do not guarantee the effectiveness of browser-based tools for managing cookies.
We use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technology on the Sites. As you browse the Sites, cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what information interests you on our site, in order to continue to provide information in the future. On occasion, we may provide targeted advertising through partners like AdRoll and Facebook to present you with additional information about our program and its offerings based on your previous interaction with the Sites and your online activity across different websites. These techniques do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number, but may collect information regarding your IP address, as well as the type of device, operating system and web browser used to access the Sites, and limited information about your internet browsing history and related online activities. We also work with third party companies to assist us with website analytics such as evaluating the use and operation of our website so that we can continue to enhance the Sites and the information contained within. We do not control the practices of our partners or third party companies with respect to the use of cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies.  You can visit networkadvertising.org/choices or aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of tracking and targeted advertising using cookies or similar technology.
Manage your preferences. Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore the Sites may not recognize DNT.
Your Rights and Choices
You have the right to access, transport, update, rectify, or erase your personal information held by us, as well as the right to object to or restrict its processing, transform it into anonymous form, or withdraw from any consent-based uses. You can exercise your rights by contacting us at the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy.
We may decline to process requests that cannot be verified as legitimately made on your behalf, appear vexatious, that jeopardize the privacy of others, or that we are required to process by law or for legitimate business or legal purposes. We may also decline aspects of requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for security or anti-fraud purposes.
You also have a right to register a complaint to your local data protection authorities if you believe your privacy rights related to your personal information have not been properly observed.
Third-Party Links and Websites
Please note that some information you receive may direct you to a non-Little League website. Please refer to these web sites for specific privacy policies and use of data as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
Individual Submissions and Promotions
We may offer coupons, special discounts, contests, games, and promotions on behalf of Little League and/or our national partners; or invite you to submit stories, photos, comments, or questions to certain areas of the Sites. On these occasions, we may ask you to voluntarily submit additional information along with your submission so that we can notify you if you are a winner, or to respond to (or ask) questions. Typically, no individual under the age of 13 is permitted to participate or to submit information to any of these promotions, except with parental/guardian consent.
