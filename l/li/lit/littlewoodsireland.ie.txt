Safety of your details
How safe are my transactions?

Buy with confidence, you can trust us
All catalogue prices are correct at the date of printing and are inclusive of VAT. Our intention is that our prices reflect the best value and we’ll do everything possible to keep them for the life of the catalogue. However, in the event of circumstances beyond our control (e.g. changes in VAT, inflationary cost increases or currency fluctuations), they may have to be altered up or down. We will inform you of any change to price before you place your order.
Discounted offers
Discounts offered for multiple buys cannot be used in conjunction with any other discounted offer. If you try to use two valid offers together, only the one that gives you the best discount will be applied.
Our products
We will repair or replace, subject to stock availability, any item failing to give reasonable wear after purchase due to defective workmanship or materials, within a 12-month period – or longer in some cases (see details with individual products) – providing the item has been reasonably used.
All products are subject to availability. While every care is taken to state the correct sizes and specifications of all items, slight variations may occur within accepted trade tolerances and in exceptional circumstances, if any article is not available, we may send you a carefully selected substitute of equal or greater value. If for this or any other reason, the goods are not acceptable, they may be returned. We’ve selected our products on the basis that they will be used for domestic use only and we will not be liable for any loss resulting from their commercial use. Our consumer contracts are governed by Irish law.
This does not affect your statutory rights.

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose information to you.
Credit Applications
If you apply for credit, Shop Direct may search your record at a credit reference agency or agencies who will supply Shop Direct with credit information.
Shop Direct will use credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to Shop Direct and/or the credit reference agencies about you and those with whom you are financially linked, may be used by Shop Direct and other companies if credit decisions are made about you or other members of your household. You are linked with another individual by means of a joint credit application or running a joint credit account. Even if your application goes no further, the credit reference agencies will add details of this search and your application to your record.
In assessing you for credit and to manage your account, Shop Direct may also use any information which the Group already holds about you.
Shop Direct may occasionally search your records with the credit reference agencies so they can manage your account and take further decisions about credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes.
If Shop Direct enters into a credit agreement with you, they may also add details of your agreement as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agency records. If you do not repay on time or in full, they may tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and Shop Direct may also share it directly within the Group. The information may be used to assess you for credit or to verify your identity.
