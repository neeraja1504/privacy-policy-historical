This Privacy Policy applies to information collected online through Company Web sites, which includes all of the Company sites and governs online data collection and usage by the Company.

COLLECTION AND TRACKING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
So that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we request information about you. We collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses and demographic information such as age, gender, and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring Web site address. This information is collected both during registration on a site or in response to specific requests, for example when signing up for a newsletter, entering a sweepstakes or contest, or answering a survey. Information collected at one Company Web site will be available within the Company's family of Web sites.
Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to offers from third parties not affiliated with the Company. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your information to the third party. However, you should note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information users consent to give to third parties not affiliated with the Company. Any information users give to another party is governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for information given to other parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any information to third parties.
WHAT WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION
We use personal information so that we may display custom, personalized content to our visitors and send newsletters, emails, features, promotional material, surveys, and other updates to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information.

We may extend offers to users on behalf of our partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but we will never give out your name or personal information at any time without your permission. As result, although LIME may receive a fee from our partners for this service, LIME sends all the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party.
We may, at times, produce reports for advertisers containing aggregate information about our users such as demographic, age, and online usage information. This allows us to work more closely with advertisers to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users. We will never include any personal information of our users in these reports.
We allow users of our Web site to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses (unless you are a member who already has voluntarily provided your email address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent.
We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation, or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.
You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online (whether through the Company's services or any other service available online), personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards, your email, or if you post personal information online, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. The Company has no control over this use of your personal information.
