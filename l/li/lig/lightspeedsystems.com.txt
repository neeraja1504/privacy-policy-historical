As you are navigating between school and related sites, please be aware that other parties’ privacy policies may come into play. If you are using any of the Services through an educational or other institution that is a customer of Lightspeed Systems this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreements between Lightspeed Systems and any other party, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between any user of the Services and their employer, their educational institution, or any third party. Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into with parties’ other than Lightspeed Systems including your employer or educational institution, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by those parties. If you are accessing Lightspeed Systems through a third-party, public, or unsecured internet provider, please be advised that any information you disclose or publish during the course of such access may be collected by any such provider and that Lightspeed Systems has no control and makes no representation as to the possible use of this information by any such provider.
YOUR DATA: How we collect and use information
We collect the following types of information.
Information about Schools: When a School administrator registers a School with Lightspeed Systems or corresponds with us online, we ask for certain information including a contact name, school name, school district, school email address and/or account name, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School’s information systems. We may also retain information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys. Once a School begins using a Lightspeed Systems Service, we will keep records of activities related to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service. Including customer service, support, and billing; to analyze our Service offerings and functionality; to communicate with our Schools and website visitors; to exchange information, and to offer related services such as user group membership and event registration.
Student Data: Lightspeed Systems may have access to personally identifiable information about students (“Student Data”) in the course of providing its Services to a School. We recognize Student Data is confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the Services on the School’s behalf. In most instances, Lightspeed Systems receives Student Data only from the School and never interacts with the Student directly. In some instances, depending on the type of Service used by the School, the Schools may allow Students to interact with a Lightspeed Systems Service. In that instance, the School provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed before the student is permitted to access the Service. Lightspeed Systems has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School’s behalf.
We may collect the following types of personally identifiable information directly from children: first name, last name, email address, password, IP address, grade level, and school. We may also generate a login ID for the child that is different than the child’s actual name or under the School’s direction, collect login/authentication data via a student information system identification number or other system designated by Customer.
Parents should consult the school’s Acceptable/Responsible Use, Social Media, Personnel, and Instructional Policies for more information about the school’s policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. Teachers are reminded to also be aware of their obligations under the Ethical Standards for educators in their state and to be conscious of their role as a model for students while interacting with students using Lightspeed Systems Services.
See “Student Safety” below for further explanation of our commitment to online student safety.
