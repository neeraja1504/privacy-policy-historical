Data Collection
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users to assist us in creating sites that honor our users’ preferences and serve their interests and needs.

Cookies can also enable us to track users’ movements and target their interests to enhance their experience at our sites. We may also collect clickstream data and assign unique identifiers to our users for the same purposes. Information obtained with these technologies may be associated with your personal information so we can better market to you and customize our advertisements and promotions to your interests.

We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis, and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user base.

We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.

Data Collection from Children

At many sites, we actively screen-out children from data collection and/or use of interactive or community features. We are committed to protecting children’s privacy.
