When you apply for a Foxtel Service** we collect personal information about you, and (where relevant) authorised representatives on your account. If you are an authorised representative on someone else's account, we may also collect information direct from you, for example if you provide your credit card information for use on an account. This enables us to connect you to your Foxtel Service, and allows us to provide and administer that service. This information may include your name, date of birth, contact details, credit card or bank account information, drivers licence number, Foxtel personal identification numbers (PINs) and other information relevant to the provision of your Foxtel Service.
We may also collect your personal information from you when you use a Foxtel Service, enter into one of our competitions or otherwise interact with us (such as through a Foxtel website, a Foxtel application or through social media). This may include information such as preference information and viewing habits and other usage data.
We may also collect your personal information from third parties where you have agreed with them that your information may be disclosed.

More information about how we use cookies, what information is collected and which third party sites we collect information from is available on the Foxtel Privacy Page which is located at http://www.foxtel.com.au/about/privacy.html.

If you are a Foxtel customer, we may link information about your viewing habits, website activity or usage with your account information.
This information provides Foxtel with statistics that we can use to analyse and improve our websites and our products and services. We may also use browsing and viewing habits data to deliver targeted marketing, advertising and content from Foxtel and third parties on Foxtel websites and Foxtel Services, as well as Foxtel advertising on third party sites, in each case relating to your preferences or interests.
