Security Standards
The security of your Personal Information is important to us and we have put into place multi-layered technical, physical and procedural measures to help keep it safe. For example, we keep Personal Information encrypted during transit and at rest using strong encryption technology and employ proactive monitoring and other tools to protect against unauthorized access. We work with third parties on an ongoing basis to keep our practices current and undergo annual third party audits that examine our practices on security and privacy.
Despite our mutual efforts, you understand and agree that perfect security does not exist and understand that there is a certain amount of risk inherent in providing and receiving services over the internet. The Services depend upon your commitment to keep your Personal Information safe. You agree to use your Personal Information in a reasonable way and to avoid recklessly disclosing your Social Security number, financial account numbers or other Personal Information to those that could improperly use or disclose it. For example, take care not to visit sites that may transmit malware, or to respond to “phishing” scams, unsolicited emails, or pop-up messages requesting your Personal Information. You may have the opportunity to participate in contests, blogs, promotions or other functions by way of the Site. Use caution when deciding to disclose your information in such a submission as these functions may be provided by a Third Party Website and subject to terms which are different than those stated in this Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information or the security of the site, or to report a potential security issue, please go to lifelock.com/security. If you have a potential security issue, please describe the matter in as much detail as possible and include any other data that might be helpful. If you are having problems accessing your account, please contact our Member Support Center.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. Your friend may contact us at Privacy@Lifelock.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Single Sign-On
You can log into our Site using sign-in services such as an Open ID provider or online banking account. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share with us certain Personal Information. If you choose to share your Personal Information, such as your name, email address, or bank account information, we will collect this information, use it to pre-populate your account profile, and combine it with any other information that we collect about you.

Our Site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the "Share this" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for other purposes. Social Media Features and Widgets are displayed on our Site, but are hosted by the third party identified in the widget. These Social Media Features and Widgets are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one, and their privacy practices may differ from those on this Site.

Our Site is not intended for the use by anyone under the age of eighteen (18) but parents or guardians may enroll minors for certain Services we offer. Other than as specifically described herein, we do not want or intend to collect or request Personal Information from anyone under the age of eighteen on this Site.

If you provide us with your email address or mailing address, you may receive marketing messages and materials from us or our affiliates. You have choices on what communications you want to receive from us. Marketing materials for our Services may also be included in messages you receive from our partners (which may include your employer if they offer our services as part of their employee benefits) or service providers that offer our services as part of a special offer. If you choose not to receive marketing communications that we send, we will honor your request. However, we will continue to communicate with you as needed to provide the Services, respond to your inquiries or otherwise relay service related messages. You may still receive information about our Services through other parties using their own mailing lists.
You can stop receiving promotional email or postal communications from us by following the instructions included in each communication, by changing your preferences in your member portal, or by contacting us at 1-800-543-3562  or by regular mail at Attn.: Marketing, 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, AZ.
Do-Not-Track
Currently, we do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online (known as “Do Not Track”). You may opt-out, however, of being tracked for purposes of online advertising as set forth in the section below (Behavioral or Interest-Based Advertising). You also may opt-out of the collection of information through cookies and other tracking technologies through your browser settings, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Behavioral or Interest-based Advertising
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other websites. For example, we use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site and other websites you may visit. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to advertise more effectively by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use some of the technologies described in this policy, such as cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. This helps us, and them, provide advertising content to you that is more relevant and tailored to your interests. As with links to other websites that may be found on our Site, these Tracking Technologies are governed by each third party's privacy policy, not this one.
We may provide these third-party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our Services. We do not provide these third parties with your Personal Information. If you don't want us to show you interest-based ads or share interest-based behavioral data with third parties, you can opt out (see below). Understand that even after opting out you will still see online ads. Opting out only means that network members from whose ad networks you have opted out will no longer deliver targeted content to you. You may continue to see interest-based advertisements from other parties from whom you have not opted out, or from companies that have not adopted the self-regulatory standards for Online Behavioral Advertising that we follow. You will also continue to receive generic ads that aren’t targeted based on your visits to multiple websites.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information and available choices for third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA). Opting out of these networks does not otherwise limit the collection of Personal or General Information described elsewhere in this Policy.
As noted, we also participate in third party ad networks and use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on third-party websites, including to display ads about LifeLock products on these sites. You may control our use of the General Information we collect about your activities on our Site to display targeted LifeLock advertising during your visits to third party websites. To opt out of receiving these targeted LifeLock ads, click here. Opting out of participation in LifeLock’s targeted advertising does not opt you out of our use of General Information for other purposes, such as analytics supporting optimization of our Site or development of new Products and Services.
Note: If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.
