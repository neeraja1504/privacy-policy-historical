Security of your Personal Information
For our users' security, Liferay utilizes a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Liferay Portal, the platform on which our website is built, has been rigorously tested and undergone white box and black box scans by leading application security testing firm Veracode.. Additionally, Liferay sponsors a security program for reporting security vulnerabilities by the open source community, customers, and independent security researchers. When you enter your personal information we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Entry into our datacenter is restricted by multiple levels of physical access controls, including key card readers and security systems that limit movement within the facility to authorized areas.
Liferay authorizes access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. While we strive to protect your Personal Information and follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at webmaster@liferay.com.
