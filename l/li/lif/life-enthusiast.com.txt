Automatic Information
For security purposes Life Enthusiast Co-op sometimes collects and analyzes the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, and to our website. This is done for your protection for tracking purposes in the unfortunate event that someone gains access to your personal or financial information and opens an account, or makes purchases under your name.
Security and Credit Card Safety
When you place an order with us, we use a secure server.
We use software that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. This means that no prying eyes will be able to see your personal information while it is in transit to us, because it will be encrypted.
This encryption software is called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and is the industry standard. It is the best encryption method available today for confident and secure online commerce transactions.
Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All payment information is kept on a stand-alone computer behind a firewall.
Still Too Nervous About Placing Your Order On-Line?
That's alright... you can also provide us with your order and payment information by telephone, toll-free at 1-866-543-3388.
