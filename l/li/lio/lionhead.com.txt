Last Updated: June 2014
Xbox Privacy Statement
This privacy statement applies to Xbox products and services ("Services"), which include Xbox console versions, the Xbox Live service, Games for Windows Live, Windows Phone Games, Xbox Music, Xbox Store, and other products and services that link to this privacy statement. This privacy statement does not apply to other Microsoft products and services that do not link to the Xbox Privacy Statement.
Please read the summaries below and click "Learn More" for more details. Some products, services or features mentioned in this statement may not be available in all markets. You may find still more information about Microsoft’s commitment to protecting your privacy at http://www.microsoft.com/privacy.
User Accounts
Summary
Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into your Xbox Live account plus other Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign in to Xbox using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. If you choose to link your Microsoft account with your account with a partner company, Microsoft may share limited account information with that company. Such account information may include name, address, email and date of birth but will not include any credit card or other payment information.  For games that enable in-game communications, the game publisher may also have access to the content of in-game communications when you are signed into your account with the publisher.
Also, some of the applications on Xbox Live are delivered by a partner company, which may require that you create an account and sign-in credentials to use that application. You should read the application’s privacy statement to understand how your data will be managed. None of this separate account credential information will be shared with Microsoft.
When you create an account (on Xbox Live), we auto-generate a nickname for the account called a gamertag, which is used to identify you when you use the Service. Because the gamertag may be publicly displayed, you should not use personal information in your gamertag.

Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners.
Creating a Microsoft account.
You can create a Microsoft account here by providing an email address, a password and other "account proofs", such as an alternate email address, a phone number, and a question and secret answer. We will use your "account proofs" for security purposes only - for instance, to verify your identity in the event that you cannot access your Microsoft account and need assistance, or to reset your password if you cannot access the email address associated with your Microsoft account. Some services may require added security, and in those cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. The email address and password that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network. Furthermore, a 64-bit unique ID number will be assigned to your credentials and will be used to identify your credentials and associated information.
When you create a Microsoft account, we will also ask you to provide the following demographic information: gender; country; birthdate; and postal code. We may use birthdate to verify that children obtain appropriate consent from a parent or guardian to use a Microsoft account, as required by local law. In addition, this demographic information is used by our online advertising systems to provide you with personalized advertisements about products and services you might find useful, but our advertising systems never get your name or contact information. In other words, our advertising systems do not contain or use any information that can personally and directly identify you (such as your name, email address and phone number). If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you may register your preference with your Microsoft account by visiting this page so that whenever you sign into web sites or services with your Microsoft account, our advertising systems will not serve you personalized ads. For more information about how Microsoft uses information for advertising, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement.
You can use an email address provided by Microsoft (such as those ending in live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) or an email address provided by a third party (such as those ending in gmail.com or yahoo.com) when signing up for your Microsoft account.
Upon creating a Microsoft account, we will send you an email asking you to verify that you are the owner of the email address associated with your Microsoft account. This is designed to verify the validity of the email address and help prevent email addresses from being used without the permission of their owners. Thereafter, we will use that email address to send you communications relating to your use of Microsoft products and services; we may also send you promotional emails about Microsoft products and services as permitted by local law. For information about managing your receipt of promotional communications, please visit Communications.
If you attempt to register for a Microsoft account and find that another individual has already created credentials with your email address as the user name, you may contact us and request that the other individual adopt a different user name so that you may use your email address when creating your credentials.
Signing into software, sites or services with your Microsoft account.
When you sign into a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. For instance, when you sign in, the Microsoft account service receives and logs your credentials and other information, such as the 64-bit unique ID number assigned to your credentials, your IP address, your web browser version and a time and date. Further, if you use a Microsoft account to sign into a device or into software that is installed on a device, a random unique ID is assigned to the device; this random unique ID will be sent as part of your credentials to the Microsoft account service when you subsequently sign into a site or service with your Microsoft account. The Microsoft account service sends the following information to the site or service that you have signed into: a unique ID number that permits the site or service to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next; the version number assigned to your account (a new number is assigned each time you change your sign-in information); whether your email address has been confirmed; and whether your account has been deactivated.
Some third party sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account require your email address in order to provide you with their services. In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. However, if you created your credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials in order to help you reset your password or provide other support services.
If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider, or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile data, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the Microsoft Service Agreement and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within such accounts.
Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. However, they can share the unique ID number provided to them by the Microsoft account service with third parties only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign into in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.
Accessing your personal information.
You can access your personal information by going to account. You can change your user name if your Microsoft account does not belong to a managed domain. You can always change your password, alternate email address, phone number, and question and secret answer. You may also close your Microsoft account by going to account, and then "Close your account." If your account is in a managed domain, as described above, there may be a special process for closing your account. Please note that if you are an MSN or a Windows Live user, if you go to account, you may be redirected to account for those sites.
More information about Microsoft account is available at the Microsoft account web site.
Non-Microsoft Account
Some of the applications found on Xbox Live are delivered by a partner company, which may require that you create an account and sign-in credentials to use that application. You should read the application’s privacy statement to understand how your data will be managed. None of this separate account credential information will be shared with Microsoft. If you choose to link your Microsoft account with your account with a partner company, Microsoft may share limited account information with that company. Such account information may include name, address, email and date of birth but will not include any credit card or other payment information.  For games that enable in-game communications, the game publisher may also have access to the content of in-game communications when you are signed into your account with the publisher.
Gamertags
When you create an account (on Xbox Live), we auto-generate a nickname for the account called a gamertag, which is used to identify you when you use the Service. You can change your gamertag by accessing your profile on Xbox.com or a device connected to the Service. Because the gamertag may be publicly displayed, you should not use personal information in your gamertag. Gamertags and associated data like game stats and presence can be seen on properties associated with the Service, such as game leader boards, including those of partner companies.

Kinect
Summary
Kinect creates a virtual gaming environment where your body motions and voice can be used to control gameplay and to navigate through the Service. Kinect uses an infrared sensor, camera, and microphone to make control possible. You can turn Kinect off at any time.
The camera can be used to sign you in. To do so, it takes an image of your face and then measures distances between key points on your face to create a numeric value that represents only you. No one could look at the numbers and know they represent you.  This authentication information stays on the console and is not shared with anyone.
You control what happens to photographs taken during gameplay and whether voice commands are captured for analysis.
When Kinect is used with certain games and apps, your skeletal movements can be used to estimate exercise stats. You can decide how your stats are managed and whether they are shared.
Some game titles may take advantage of a new Xbox capability called expressions. This feature allows you to use your defined facial expressions to control or influence a game. This data does not identify you, stays on the console and is destroyed once your session ends.

The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor. It enables you to be the controller, using voice, gestures or body movements.
Kinect’s camera and infrared sensor can be used to track your gestures or body movements as you control games or apps, or to navigate through Xbox. The camera can be used to sign you into the Services on the console using facial recognition technology if you choose. To do this it takes an image of your face and then measures distances between key points on your face to create a numeric value that represents only you. This value is stored as a very long set of numbers.  No one could look at the numbers and know they represent you. This information stays on the console and is not shared with anyone.  If you choose to sign in using Kinect, it looks at your face and if it recognizes you, you will be signed in to your profile. It also allows you to join a game in progress and be signed in automatically
Infrared helps services function in low-light settings and can be used for gameplay as needed.
For gameplay, Kinect will map distances between your body’s joints to create a stick figure – a “skeleton” – that helps Kinect enable gameplay on your console or between you and another online player.  The numeric values for the stick figures are temporarily stored in memory on your console during the gameplay session, then are destroyed when you end the session. If you are playing online, Microsoft may collect those numeric values to enable and improve gameplay and improve the gaming experience. The numeric values sent to Microsoft are destroyed after analysis is complete. The stick figure representation cannot be used to identify you.
Kinect is also tracking hand gestures. When the sensor detects specific hand gestures intended to do simple system interactions (such as menu navigation, menu selection, pan/zoom, scroll), these motions are translated to specific “input instructions” as if they were happening from any other input device (such as a controller). These “input instructions” cannot be used to identify you.
Some game titles may take advantage of a new Xbox capability called expressions. This feature allows you to use your facial expressions to control or influence a game. This data does not identify you, stays on the console and is destroyed once your session ends.
Kinect games may photograph you while you are engaging in game play. You can view your photographs and decide whether to keep, transfer them off the console, or discard them. These photographs do not leave the console unless you choose to share them.
Kinect’s microphones help enable chat and audio.  Chat includes online voice talk between players during gameplay or talking to others using services such as Skype.  You should not expect any level of privacy concerning your use of the live communication features such as voice chat, video and communications in live-hosted gameplay sessions offered through the Services. We may monitor these communications to the extent permitted by law, but we cannot monitor the entire Service and make no attempt to do so.  You understand that others can record and use these communications. Communications in live-hosted gameplay sessions may also be broadcast to others. Please note that Xbox does not listen in on Skype calls.
Audio includes commands for voice control of the console (for example, “Xbox Play”), using the Xbox voice search service, or altering the dynamic of gameplay  (for example, menu navigation or interacting with the game environment).  ). If you use your voice to enter search terms on Xbox, we will collect your voice snippet and convert your voice to text in order to provide you search results.
Voice Data for Product Improvement – You control whether Microsoft can use your Kinect voice data for product improvement. With user consent, samples of voice commands or voice search requests occurring while using Kinect may be collected and periodically sent to Microsoft for product improvement.   You can view the settings related to voice data use, both voice commands and voice search data, via the Settings. If you change your choice around the use of this data for product improvement from Allow to Block, this will delete any voice samples stored on the console awaiting upload, not what has already been sent to Microsoft. We store voice data used for product improvement separately from any account information that directly identifies you.
Managing your Kinect experience
If you choose to use Kinect as an authenticated user, the sign-in data does not leave the console. You can delete all the Kinect sign-in data you have stored on the console by going to Settings, disabling Kinect sign-in, and selecting "Remove my Kinect sign-in data" or by removing your profile from that console. If you choose to use Kinect as an unauthenticated guest, Xbox creates a temporary unique identifier for you that lets you participate in a gaming session. When the session is finished, Xbox deletes the data about you.
You ****can disable Kinect  from the Kinect section in Settings. To enable Kinect again, you will need to go back to Settings.
You can disconnect Kinect by simply unplugging it from the back of the Xbox console.
If the console is in instant-on mode, then when the console is turned off, anyone will be able to wake the console by saying “Xbox On.” You can manage whether the console listens for this phrase from Settings.
To learn more about Kinect, please visit the Kinect FAQ.
Exercise Information – If you use Xbox Fitness on Xbox One, or certain games and apps on Xbox 360, Xbox can use the Kinect sensor to estimate your exercise info, including estimates such as your heart rate during a certain activity or the number of calories burned during a workout. To improve the accuracy of your exercise info, you can enter attributes such as your height, weight, age, and gender. To share your accomplishments and participate in Xbox Live Fitness challenges, you can share your exercise info on Xbox Live. You can also choose to keep your exercise info private. New accounts created on the Xbox One have a have privacy defaults on exercise info set to block, which means it’s stored online and kept private. On Xbox 360, you can store your exercise info online or offline, on that Xbox 360. Children’s exercise info settings are controlled by adults in their Xbox families. To delete exercise info, do so through the apps or games you used to create it.
Xbox Music, Video, and TV
Summary
To enable a sharing experience on Xbox Music and Xbox Video and help you discover content that may interest you, Microsoft will collect information about what content you play, the length of play, and the rating you give in Xbox Music and Xbox Video. This information is sent to Microsoft directly from the device using the Xbox Music or Xbox Video service.

See the DRM information in the Microsoft Silverlight Privacy Statement for more information.
Whether your live TV viewing history is available to Microsoft depends on what live TV viewing app you use. If you use the Xbox TV App, there is a customer control allowing adults to choose whether we may collect information about live TV they watch through Xbox in order to provide them with recommendations and to improve the service. We may also collect TV viewing history from your console in a way that doesn’t identify you or others. We do not allow children or teens to choose to send us this information.
If you use a TV viewing application from another company, your privacy settings with that company (if any) determine whether that publisher may send your viewing history to Microsoft.

If you have children who use the Services, you can set up child accounts for them. Children 17 and younger cannot create an account for the Services without parental consent. The owner of the associated parent account must consent to the collection of information about the child. This may involve the collection and verification of a credit card number in order to help determine that the owner of that parent account is an adult.
When a Microsoft site or service collects age information, it will either block users who say they are under 13 or will ask them to provide consent from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under 13 to provide more information than is necessary to provide the Service.
When a parent grants consent, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child may have access to communication services like e-mail, audio and video chat and may be able to communicate with other users of all ages.
Adults in the family can change or revoke the consent choices previously made on Xbox.com. Parents can look in User Accounts for more information on how to review or edit their children's personal information. Parents can contact support here to request the deletion of their children's personal information.
If you have privacy questions about Xbox, you can contact us as described in the Other Important Privacy Information section. Below are third-party game publishers and app developers that may also collect personal information through Xbox:

You can manage those cookies through your browser settings. Microsoft does not deploy cookies on the Xbox console.

Microsoft Use of Cookies
Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801
We may use cookies for:
Storing your Preferences and Settings. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.
Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
Targeted Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.
Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:
Cookie name
|
Description
---|---
MUID
|
Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.
ANON
|

CC
|
Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.
Microsoft account authentication

In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive.
Microsoft does not deploy cookies on the Xbox console. The browser on Xbox does allow cookies to be set, and you can manage those cookies through browser settings.  Third party applications accessed through the console may set cookies.  Consult the application’s privacy statement for more information.
** How to Control Cookies**
Browser Controls to Block Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:
1. Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
2. Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window
3. Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block
Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
Browser Controls to Delete Cookies. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps:
1. Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"
2. On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button
3. On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies”
4. Click the "Delete" button
Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection. Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.
Internet Explorer 9 has a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and how to find them, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help.
Advertising Opt-Out Controls. Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:
Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/
Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at http://choice.microsoft.com/advertisementchoice/. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.
Our Use of Web Beacons

This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies") and Silverlight Application Storage.
