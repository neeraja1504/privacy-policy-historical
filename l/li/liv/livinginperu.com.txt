To help facilitate bookings or other interactions between Travelers, we may need to share certain information, including personal information, with other Travelers, as it is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, as follows:
When you as a Traveler submit a booking request, certain information about you is shared with third-party partners, including your full name, the full name of any additional Travelers, your cancellation history, and other information you agree to share.

The LivinginPeru Platform lets you publish information, including personal information, that is visible to the general public. For example:
After completing a booking, the Traveler may write Reviews and rate the services provided by LivinginPeru. Reviews and Ratings are a part of your public profile page and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the LivinginPeru Platform (such as the Listing page).
If you submit content in a community or discussion forum, blog or social media post, or use a similar feature on the LivinginPeru Platform, that content is publicly visible.
Based on our legitimate interest to promote the LivinginPeru Platform we may display parts of the LivinginPeru Platform on sites operated by LivinginPeru’s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs.

These disclosures may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations, for the protection of your or another person’s vital interests or for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping the LivinginPeru Platform secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage.
Where appropriate, we may notify Travelers about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon LivinginPeru’s property, its Travelers and the LivinginPeru Platform. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that the Traveler about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.

Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.

We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, LivinginPeru may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
The information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the LivinginPeru Platform, even after your LivinginPeru Account is canceled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain the LivinginPeru Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.

Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by LivinginPeru you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to LivinginPeru specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular, where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of LivinginPeru override your own.
6.6 Objection to Processing.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require LivinginPeru not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing LivinginPeru will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask LivinginPeru to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by using our contact form.
