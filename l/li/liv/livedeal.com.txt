When you leave a testimonial, we ask for your name, zip, email and phone number. This testimonial is displayed on our website with your name and the State from which you post the testimonial. No other information is publicly displayed with the testimonial. If you use the testimonial feature on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit within the body of the testimonial can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in the body of the testimonials.
We use the information that we collect to improve product offerings, fulfill your requests, bill you for services, customize the web site's content and layout, develop feedback ratings, contact you, and for marketing activities and statistical analysis.

We provide information about our users to trusted partners (such as credit card processor) who work on our behalf pursuant to confidentiality agreements.  Pursuant to the terms of their agreements, these companies do not have any independent right to share or use such information.
We may disclose user information in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Of course, once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our web site, LiveDeal has no control over how your information is used or shared by that individual. You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you meet through our web site, as the only protection you will have is whatever terms you agree to directly with this individual.
