Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We may use the information collected in the following ways:
To operate and maintain the Blog;
To send you promotional information, such as newsletters. I try to limit the number of emails I send to one per week. On occasion, I might send two during a certain week if there’s a special sale or giveaway. Each email promotion will provide information on how to opt-out of future mailings;
To send you administrative communications, such as confirmation emails and updates on policies;
To respond to your comments or inquiries;
To provide you with user support;
To track and measure advertising on the blog;
To protect, investigate, and deter against unauthorized or illegal activity.
THIRD-PARTY USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Blog may use third-party service providers to service various aspects of the Blog. Each third-party service provider’s use of your personal information is dictated by their respective privacy policies.
The Blog currently uses the following third-party service providers:
Google Analytics – this service tracks Blog usage and provides information such as referring websites and user actions on the Blog. Google Analytics may capture your IP address, but no other personal information is captured by Google Analytics. Please refer to Google Analytics cookie usage for further information.
aWeber – this service is used for delivery of email updates and newsletters. We store your name and email address for purposes of delivering such communications.  Please refer to aWeber’s privacy policy for further information.
Social Warfare plugin is used for social media sharing.
This list may be amended from time to time in the Blog’s sole discretion.
Advertising
Display Ads
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve content and advertisements when you visit the Blog, which may use cookies, as noted above. (The ad network used on this Blog is Mediavine). Please refer to Mediavine’s Privacy Policy for further information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Affiliate Program Participation
The Website may engage in affiliate marketing, which is done by embedding tracking links into the Website. If you click on a link for an affiliate partnership, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions.
Living Montessori Now is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and links to Amazon.com. As part of this Amazon Associates program, the Website will post customized links, provided by Amazon, to track the referrals to their website. This program utilizes cookies to track visits for the purposes of assigning commission on these sales.
Newsletters
On the Blog, you may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Blog to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user. This information will not be passed on to third parties.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
