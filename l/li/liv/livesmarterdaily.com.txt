Introduction

This privacy policy (the "Policy") applies to our website, livesmarterdaily.com (the "Site") and outlines the types of information we collect via the Site, how we use that information, and the efforts we make to safeguard it. By providing any information through the Site, you agree to the use of that information consistent with this Policy.

Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information ("PII") is information that identifies you, is not generally available to the public and may include information about your family as well as you personally. We collect the PII that you provide us via the Site so that we may provide you with the service(s) we offer. If you elect, we may also collect PII from third-party data providers. You are not obligated to provide us with PII; however, if you do not provide us with certain information that we request, we may not be able to respond to your requests, process your applications or otherwise conduct the business contemplated between you and us.
For example, in order to provide you with insurance quotes, we collect your personal contact information including name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, gender, birthday, marital status, information about your vehicles and drivers and may also collect information about your credit and your existing insurance coverage.
If you are an insurance agent using EverQuote Pro to purchase referrals, we work with a third-party to collect from you and transmit your credit card and billing information. Your credit card number and related information are not accessible by us.
