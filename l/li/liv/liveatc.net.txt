The information we collect is covered by the LiveATC Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices.

Children
When a child under age 13 attempts to register with the LiveATC.net Forums, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian grant parental permission. LiveATC.net will not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission. LiveATC.net does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion. Please see our Notice to Parents Regarding the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 below for more details.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
LiveATC.net does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with LiveATC.net under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help LiveATC.net communicate with you about offers from LiveATC.net and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing LiveATC.net to collect and use their child's information without consenting to LiveATC.net sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes;
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LiveATC.net's Terms and Conditions of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
We will transfer information about you if LiveATC.net is acquired by or merged with another company. We will post a notice on our site before this occurs and/or if a new privacy policy will be applicable as a result.
LiveATC.net works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers. In order to bring you the products and services you have requested, we may share your personal information with them. We will not authorize these service providers to share your information other than as necessary to provide the services you have requested or beyond the extent to which you have granted us permission to do so.

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Shared Objects
LiveATC.net may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the website. This unique number identifies your web browser to our computer system. A cookie will not allow a website to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your web browser when you visit our site or Service. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major websites. It is possible to adjust your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that certain sites and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies.
Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on Web pages and within certain email. Working in conjunction with cookies, Web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use Web beacons to let us know how many people opened certain types of email. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable information. Keep in mind that any image file on a Web page can act as a Web beacon. Third-party advertisers may use Web beacons in their advertisements.
Shared Objects are used to store data on your computer in much the same way that data is stored in a cookie created through a web browser. Various uses of Shared Objects include remembering a user's favorite color, or the last frame of a movie watched. The data can only be read by movies originating from the same domain that created the Shared Object. Shared Objects can not remember a user's e-mail address or other personal information unless they willingly provide such information.
Without cookies, Web beacons, and Shared Objects, it would be difficult for us to know which services have a larger audience than others, or to offer you all the services and functionality that we do. Tracking audience size helps us to better understand when to launch new services and enhance the current offerings.
LiveATC.net lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages or offer you products and services in connection with the LiveATC.net Service set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to LiveATC.net's cookies.
We use both in-house and third-party ad serving technologies to help us deliver ads with some of the audio streams you listen to. Such technology may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visit to the website where you selected the audio stream in order to identify and display advertisements that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving these advertisements, a unique cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to serve ads to you, please click here .
