Cookies and web beacons
This website or the advertisers on the website may use cookies and/or web beacons to collect data in the ad serving process.
A cookie is a small text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
A web beacon (also called a clear gif or pixel tag) is a 1x1 pixel .gif image that advertisers place on their webpages. When you visit these pages, the web beacons can send your browser type, IP address, and other basic information to a server so advertisers can analyze the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. If you'd like to opt-out of web beacon tracking, you can clear your cookies.
However these cookies are not used to extract any information from you. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies. We do not track or monitor these "cookies".
