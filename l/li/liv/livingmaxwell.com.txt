Privacy Policy | livingmaxwell: a guide to organic food & drink
Livingmaxwell.com is committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to our website. The privacy policy set forth below (this “Policy”) applies only to the website and online services provided by Livingmaxwell.com. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our website, how we may use that information, and how we disclose it to third parties.
Information That We Collect
Personal Information
At various locations on our website, such as in registration forms, surveys, and polls, we may request that you supply us with “personal information,” such as your name, email address, mailing address, home or work telephone number. Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our website, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our website if you choose not to provide certain information. If you do choose to give us personal information through our website, we will collect and retain that information.
Non-Personal Information
When you use our website, we may also collect “non-personal information.” We consider “non-personal information” to be information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you personally, such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, etc.). Non-personal information may also include technical information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our website, and other anonymous data involving your use of our website. Non-personal information may also include information that you provide us through your use of our website, such as the terms you enter into the search functions of our website. We reserve the right to use or disclose non-personal information in any way we see fit.
Cookies
We may use “cookies” to enhance your visits to our website. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not store personal information about you, unless you knowingly provide it. Cookies can store non-personal information, such as what websites, pages, or advertisements your browser has accessed. We may use cookies to store information and personalize your experience with our website. For example, cookies allow our website to recognize your browser as a previous visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while you were previously browsing our website. Our cookies can also store your password, personalize pages, and keep track of selections, such as your time zone and episode selections.
You do have control over cookies. Most browsers can be set to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. Most browsers can also be set to refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience. You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer. For more information about working with cookies, you should consult your user manual, FAQ, or “help” function of your specific browser and operating system software.
Web Beacons
We also may use “web beacons” (also often referenced as “clear GIFs”, “clear pixels”, “web bugs”, “1×1 GIFs”, or “1×1 pixels”) which are tiny graphic image files, imbedded in a web page in GIF, jpeg or HTML format, that provide a presence on the web page and send back to its home server information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the web beacon is located, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any cookies on your computer previously placed by that server. We may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of our website and the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and selected sponsors’ and advertisers’ sites. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our website or those of our sponsors’. We do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission
Use of Information We Collect

We use your personal information to provide you any services that you may request or require, to communicate with you and to allow you to participate in online surveys. We use aggregated non-personal information about our users to understand our website’s demographics, such as the percentage of male and female users, the geographic distribution of our users, the age ranges of our users, a combination of these or other demographics. We may also use the personal or non-personal information we collect to analyze how our website is being used, and to improve the content of our website, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Email Communications
If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. You will have the opportunity to subscribe to an opt-in electronic newsletter that will send information about our website or our advertisers to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications. You may request at any time that we not email you in the future by clicking the “unsubscribe” link which is included at the bottom of any email that you receive from us. If you unsubscribe, we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email communications as soon as practicable.
Security of the Information We Collect

In those instances, we may need to share your personal information with them. We require these companies to use your personal information only to provide the particular product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information for any other reason.
