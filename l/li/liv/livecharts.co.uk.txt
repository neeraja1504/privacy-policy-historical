Trading Risks
Leveraged Contracts for Difference ("CFD") and Foreign Exchange ("Forex") trading carries a high degree of risk.
The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the position so that transactions are ‘leveraged’ or ‘geared’. A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with your broker to maintain your position in the market.
