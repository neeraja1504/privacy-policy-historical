Effective date: June 15th, 2016
Your privacy is important to LIVESTORM. So weâ€™ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices.

A Service may supplement this privacy policy with additional privacy terms or with additional privacy notices in connection with certain features of that Service.
This privacy policy does not apply to websites, applications or mobile platforms that are not linked to this privacy policy or to those operated by third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on those websites, applications and mobile platforms.

The Service collects information from you in two ways:
directly from your input ;
automatically through the Livestorm 's technologies.

c. Cookies and web beacons
The Service may also automatically collect information through the use of cookies or similar technologies, such as web beacons. Cookies are small text files that a website sends to the browser on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a web page so that the website can recognize your device the next time you visit. Most web sites typically use the following:
"Session" cookies, which are temporary and deleted when you close your browser;
"Persistent" cookies, which remain until you delete them or they expire;
Web beacons, which are electronic images also known as single-pixel gifs.
In general, cookies, web beacons and similar technologies do not contain personally identifiable information, but when you furnish your personal information through the Service, this information may be linked to the non-personally identifiable data stored in cookies sent to your browser from the Service.
LIVESTORM and its service providers use these technologies for various purposes, including: facilitating the login process, administering, customizing and improving the Service.
There are a number of ways to manage cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. However, if you block cookies, you may not be able to register, login or make full use of the Service. You can also use your mobile device's settings to manage the available privacy options.
Our HTML-formatted emails may contain a web beacon to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links within the email. We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users and to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them. The web beacon will be deleted when you delete the email. Emails in plain text rather than HTML will not include the web beacon.
Use of personal information
We use the personal information collected through the Livestorm Service to complete various actions:
to provide, modify and improve Livestorm service and support;
to update you on relevant new services and benefits;
to personalize the Livestorm Service and to select content to be communicated to you or to use features on the Service such as sharing content with a coworker;
for data analysis, audits, enhancing the Service, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our Livestorm Service
to prevent and detect security threats, fraud or other malicious activity;
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

However, judicial or administrative authorities may require the disclosure of data allowing identification of a user.
Access to and accuracy of your personal information
