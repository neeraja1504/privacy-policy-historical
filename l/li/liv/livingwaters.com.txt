How does LIVING WATERS use the Contact Information I provide to them?
We greatly value the trust you place in us. The personal information you provide to us will not be given to or shared with anyone outside of Living Waters unless you explicitly allow it, or we believe that it is necessary to comply with the law, protect the safety of any person, or to address fraud, security or technical issues.

Online Contributions
When you make a contribution on our website, the personal information you provide to us is protected using SSL encryption, which protects sensitive data transmissions from your computer to our website.

You may choose to reject cookies and still use much of our entire website, although some aspects of our website may be disabled.
