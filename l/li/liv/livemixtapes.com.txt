How We Use Personal Information
This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from us, or any of our partner Sites, via e-mail, via third party partner Sites or otherwise.

These businesses and third parties may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers.
We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.

The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our users’ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for us but we do not permit them to use your Personal Information for other purposes.
Additionally, we purchase and manage e-mail lists generated by affiliate Sites and organizations. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present and available at the end of each piece of e-mail that we send.
We will also use your Personal Information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on a Site and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on a Site. We may also use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business.
