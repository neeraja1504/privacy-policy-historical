Privacy Policy | LikeShareTweet
Welcome to our privacy policy! This will tell you how we look after your information that we get through our website. Don’t worry, it’s simple to understand, and has been created to protect you.
One of the most important things to us is that any data or information you give us is personal, and we want to keep it that way. That is why any information we receive, whatever it is, will be protected. Any information that you give us that means we may be able to identify you will always be treated in this way. We will never pass on any information that you give us to anyone else.
However, times change, and technology changes the fastest of all. That’s why we reserve the right to change our policy every now and again, in order to better protect you. You may want to check back here every now and again, to make sure that you are still happy with our level of commitment to safeguard your information. This particular privacy policy is accurate as of May 9th, 2014.
Security
There’s no point in keeping data if it isn’t secure, and we can guarantee that your data is. In order to do this effectively, stop any criminal activity, and ensure that you are happy, there are many different levels of protection, including physical and electronic. All data that is given to us through this website receives the same level of care and control.
How we use cookies
Websites throughout the world use cookies, and we are no different. These tiny files are stored on your computer so that we can better understand what you are looking for online. It also means that we can tailor our service to your exact requirements, through better understanding your preferences, and the things that you don’t want to see.
When we use cookies, we are doing it to understand which pages are being looked at the most. This can help us realize what is popular, and what we can do to make our website better and more engaging. The data that we collect isn’t kept for long: as soon as we’ve made a decision from that data, it is deleted permanently from our system.
Cookies are useful bits of program, but they are not able to give us any information on who you are, where you are, or what is on your computer. They do not let us control your computer, gain any files, or delete anything. But we understand that some people are unhappy with cookies being on their computer, and that is why we will always give you the choice. You can decide whether or not to accept the cookies from our website, giving you the ultimate control over your computer, as it should be. However, it will mean that our website cannot be tailored to what you want.
Third party vendors
There are many other third parties – not you, and not us – that use cookies to help understand what adverts to place on the websites that you visit. Google is just one of those companies. They use what is called a DoubleClick cookie, so that they and their partners can show you adverts based on your previous searches, and other websites that you have visited. This means that even if you do not accept cookies from our website, the adverts that appear on it have been tailored to your internet browsing history.
Opt-Out
We partner with third party advertisers to serve and display advertising on the Services. These partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect information about your activities across different websites and services to provide you with relevant advertising. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. To serve and display advertising relevant to your location, the Services may also track your device’s precise geolocation by responding to beacons or inaudible signals sent to your device’s microphone. If you do not want the location of your device to be tracked by the Services, please opt-out using your device settings.
Links to other websites
There is so much that we want to share with you, and occasionally this information will be found on another website. We include links to these websites to offer you the chance to read more on a topic, but once you leave us, you will be part of a different privacy policy, and it may not be as secure as ours. This means that we cannot guarantee that they are protecting your data as well as we do. Always be careful of new websites, and ensure you check their privacy policies before you give them any information. Not everyone is as careful as us.
