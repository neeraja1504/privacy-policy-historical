4.1. Personal Information
Before using our service, users are required to first complete a registration form and provide Liberty Reserve with personal identifiable information such as complete name, date of birth, ID number, address, email, and phone number. In addition, those willing to use the merchant tools of their accounts are required to provide Liberty Reserve with the name and URL of their online store. This information can be changed, updated and/or corrected according to Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.
This personal identifiable information is not supplemented with information from other sources. However, in some cases, the information provided by the users on www.libertyreserve.com might be subject to internal verification processes for security and compliance reasons. Under these processes, we may request users to submit documents to verify some of the information provided on our website.
Said personal identifiable information is used by Liberty Reserve only to provide the electronic transfer service and fill customer’s orders. Then, when such orders are taken out, users are notified based on the personally identifiable information provided by them. This information is also used to tailor the website to the person to whom the information pertains; to send customers strictly administrative messages in the event a problem with their account arises, and to provide customer-service in response to their inquiries.
All personally identifiable information provided by users is retained for no longer than it is necessary (i) to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and (ii) comply with internationally accepted laws and regulations. Under said laws and regulations we must keep such information from the moment users open an account to 5 years after they close it.

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement as indicated in Section 5.4 of this Privacy Policy. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications because they are not promotional in nature. However, they can deactivate their account by sending a request via contact us form. Those users who request the deactivation of their accounts will receive a confirmation email within the next 48 hours and will be effectively removed from the list of users to whom these communications are sent.
5.3. Customer Service
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested customer-services and solve issues related to their accounts. These communications are usually made via email or through the live chat service provided in our website.
5.4. Blog
Our Website offers a publicly accessible blog. Said blog is used as an additional communication channel where we post announcements that may be of interest for our users. Although we do not allow our users to reply those posts, from time to time we may use our blog to place surveys and collect non-personally identifiable information from those willing to help us improve our service. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
6. Legal Disclaimer
Though we make every effort to preserve user´s privacy, we may need to disclose all the personal identifiable information we have collected from our users when required by law, to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.

Users are able to correct material inaccuracies in their personally identifiable information at any time. To make those corrections user can visit the Personal Information page placed within their Liberty Reserve Account. However, users shall consider that both dates of birth and email addresses are subject to special procedures.
This information cannot be changed by users themselves. For security reasons, users willing to update their email addresses shall send a request through the contact us form provided in our site. Then, a support agent will request users to provide us with the following: date of birth, current e-mail address and the new e-mail address. Dates of birth, in turn, cannot be changed for compliance reasons. They can be corrected though, but only if the user remembers the date entered when filling the registration form and requests the correction through the contact us form provided in our site. Otherwise, users will be required to open a new account and use a correct date of birth as stated in the FAQ Section of our website.
