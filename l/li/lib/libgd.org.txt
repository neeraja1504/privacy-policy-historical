Privacy and Legal Statement - Atlassian
Atlassian adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, and/or other identifiable information).
Gathering and Use of Information
We will never share your information with third parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following:
software evaluation registration
subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)
purchase transactions
content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
contest or sweepstakes registration
bug submission
feature request
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
If you chose to have a relationship with Atlassian, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
Employees of Atlassian or approved contractors or resellers have access to personally identifiable customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your information with third parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
If you call us to find out whether another person or party within your organisation has evaluated or purchased our software, we may disclose that information, but you will be required to demonstrate proof that you belong to the organisation that you are inquiring about. Atlassian will not willfully disclose your personal information to any third party without first receiving your permission.
As an international company, Atlassian maintains databases in Australia and the United States. Any information that you submit to us via our Websites may be sent electronically to a database maintained in either country. We protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all Atlassian networks adhere to data-protection principles described in this page.
We store all email transactions and strive to keep records of phone calls with customers, partners, and software evaluators so we have a history of our interactions that can be used for Pre-Sales Support and Technical Support.
We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position, tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address (although generally they do not), we will use that data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.
The Atlassian family of websites contain links to other sites. Atlassian is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these linked websites.
You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from Atlassian at any time. You only need to e-mail us to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please allow five (5) business days for the removal to be processed.
Transactions are recorded, including, but not limited to, when a user downloads software, purchases, logs into his/her account, or generates a software license key. We do not store any credit card or bank account information on any online systems that can be accessed remotely.

Trademarks
We've developed these guidelines to ensure our company trademarks are properly displayed and remain undiluted across our customer, partner, and plugin ecosystems. Among the reasons our trademark guidelines are important include:
We want our brand and brand names to be associated with awesome dev and IT tools. The more focused the use of the brand, the more powerful it will be in the community.
More people and companies are building plugins and becoming partners or ambassadors of Atlassian and our products. They are asking for additional guidelines around how to market, design and brand their plugins and products so they (1) complement the Atlassian product "family", and (2) are distinct from from Atlassian products and brands while remaining part the Atlassian community.
We want to avoid potential conflicts that may arise. If your brand is not clearly differentiated, customers may struggle to identify who to work with or what to buy. As a way of protecting our brands, as well as the best interests of our 3rd party developers and customers, we are sharing publishing these expanded guidelines.
Our Trademarks
Atlassian has registered some of the trademarks below or has otherwise sought protection as indicated below in Australia, the U.S and other countries. We have done this to protect and preserve the marks for our community of customers, developers, partners, and supporters for the benefit of everyone involved with Atlassian. By this we mean that people should be able to recognize when a product is from Atlassian.
You may use the Atlassian trademarks below in any blog, news article, or on your website without our written consent, as long as you use them according to this guideline, retain the capitalization structure indicated below, and retain the ® symbol or TM symbol as applicable on the right shoulder of the mark according to the usage in the list below.

---|---|---
Atlassian  |  ®  |  Computer software company, logo and its products / services
JIRA  |  ®  |  Issue tracking project management software
JIRA Studio  |  ®  |  Computer software development suite

If you have any questions about the use of Atlassian trademarks, please contact us at trademarks@atlassian.com.
Our logos
Atlassian logos are distinctive graphic renditions. You may use the Atlassian logo or product logos in a blog or news article, publication, book or other online or offline medium, or on your website in reference to the respective Atlassian product, without our written consent, provided that the logos are duplicated exactly as shown in the preceding link, and the ® symbol (or the TM symbol, as applicable) attached to the shoulder of the logo as in the attached link is retained. All other usages of the Atlassian logos require the written approval of Atlassian.
Name dropping
Trademarks protect Atlassian as well as our community of customers, developers, partners, and vendors. They identify the source of one provider's products from another. By "products" we mean all types of offerings, ranging from commercial products and services to open source and free software and informational websites. Trademark law protects the public's ability to rely on trademarks for information about product source and quality, requiring trademark owners to take steps to police proper use of their marks.
In the Atlassian ecosystem of customers, vendors and partners, the Atlassian product names are used in naming for 3rd party products, product reviews, product usage, and more. Below are some guidelines for using Atlassian product naming conventions in your work:
It's okay to use Atlassian's product names and trademarks in your own software product or company naming, however it must be clear that your product is a third-party tool, not an Atlassian-generated tool.
For example: "Acme plugin for JIRA®" is okay, whereas "JIRA® plugin for Acme" is not. The former connotes a 3rd party plugin for JIRA®, the latter connotes an Atlassian-developed tool.
It's okay to use Atlassian logos and brand names on your website or blog. You don't need permission from us to use the brands or names.
Your website should look like your website, not ours. It should not borrow heavily from or closely resemble Atlassian's website or web properties. For the sake of customers and consumers, clearly distinguishable websites help everyone.
You may use the Atlassian logo or product logo in any blog, news article, or on your website without our written consent, as long as you follow these guidelines and do not modify our brand designs.
It is acceptable to use Atlassian or our product names or brands in publications, blogs, books or other online or offline mediums, provided this outline is adhered to and the ® symbol or TM symbol as applicable is retained on the right shoulder of the mark. In a longer publication where Atlassian is cited more than once, the trademark symbol need only be used the first time the brand is mentioned.
Do not concatenate product names, e.g., "MyConnectorJIRA."
You are not permitted to modify the Atlassian logo or product logos in anyway except to resize a logo for the page where it's displayed.
Atlassian Style
In addition to trademarks and service marks, Atlassian has developed artwork, screenshots, and imagery for our website and other web properties.
Atlassian's "look" or "feel" should not be reproduced or mimicked for the same reasons cited above: consumers and customers can be confused about whether they're dealing with Atlassian or another company. The Atlassian website and all intellectual property rights, including all Copyright rights therein, are owned by Atlassian. Reproduction or "creative borrowing" of the website or artwork without permission is a violation of Atlassian's Copyright. Atlassian product documentation has been released under Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia License and retains the permissions and rights granted under Creative Commons.
If there are design elements that you wish to re-use on your website (e.g., to reuse a screenshot), please contact us for permission at trademarks@atlassian.com.
Grandfathering
We realize these guidelines are being introduced at a point in time when some companies and individuals already have product names that include the Atlassian trademarks. Companies and individuals using the Atlassian product trademarks by or before October 1, 2009 will not be required to change their already existing product names to comply with these guidelines now or in the future. However, we do request that these companies and individuals give proper notice and attribution of the Atlassian trademarks, and that any new product name will follow these guidelines.
If you have any questions about the use of Atlassian marks or logos, please contact us at trademarks@atlassian.com.
