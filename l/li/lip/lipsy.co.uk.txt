Lipsy - Privacy Policy
How Secure Is My Information?
While we know that any woman wearing Lipsy can't help but get noticed, there are some things that a girl needs to keep to herself.
At Lipsy.co.uk, we ensure that your personal information is secure. Every transaction is processed online using the latest industry standards for secure online credit card transactions. For those of you who speak techno lingo, secure servers protect your information using advanced encryption and firewall technology throughout the ordering process. We use high level SSL encryption technology and 3D Secure from Verified by Visa and Mastercard SercureCode. You can tell whether a page is secure as 'https' will replace 'http' in your browser address window. A small padlock will also appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.
Who Is Lipsy.co.uk?

Links
This website may contain links to other sites. Lipsy.co.uk is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those websites, please read their Privacy Policy or contact them directly.
3D Secure
We now have 3D Secure as part of the checkout process on the Lipsy website to give you a safer shopping experience when using your credit card online.
Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode follow the same principles as Chip and Pin and help to protect your card against unauthorised use when you shop via the Internet.
This process is simple and will give you added protection, security and peace of mind. You may have already registered for this service on another online retail site but if you haven't it's a simple process, as detailed below.
When you reach the checkout process you will have the opportunity to register for either Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. To sign up for the service simply follow the online instructions which are linked directly to your card issuer, you will be asked to set up your new personal password (which is linked to your card not the computer) and then once your card issuer has confirmed your identity you can continue to shop!
It's a one-off registration process which means that you will be able to use the same password for all future purchases you make with all participating retailers, not just Lipsy. And if you've already registered elsewhere you will simply have to enter your password.
Alternatively you can contact your bank directly to register. Please visit Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode for more information.
If you choose not to register during the checkout process, depending on your card issuer, we may not be able to process your order. A different method of payment will be required to complete your purchase.
