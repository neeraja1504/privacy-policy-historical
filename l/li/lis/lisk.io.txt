Privacy Policy
Introduction
In Lisk Foundation (“we”, “our”, “us”) we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We are a foundation established in Switzerland with a registered office at Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, and for the purpose of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), we are the data controller.
This policy sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data or usage information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with your use of our website at https://lisk.io (the “Website”) and use of our tools: Lisk Protocol, Lisk Network Token, Lisk Desktop, Lisk Elements, Lisk Commander, Lisk Mobile and Lisk Core (collectively: “Lisk Services”).
Please read this policy carefully so that you understand your rights in relation to your personal data, and how we will collect, use and process your personal data. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not access the Website, use our Chat or Lisk Services.
What types of information do we collect and how we use it?
Information you give us. You may provide information by contacting us via our Website, Lisk Chat, email or when using Lisk Services. You also provide us with information by creating your Lisk Chat account or signing up for the Lisk newsletter. Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently to data subject. This means that we will process your personal data only under allowable legal basis and we will provide you certain information when collecting your personal data and when you exercise your rights (see Your rights). We expect that the legal basis for processing your personal data will be either:
• your unambiguous, informed, freely given and specific consent, which you can withdraw at any time, or
• a contract between us, formed for example when you decide to use Lisk Services.
It is also possible that we may be required to process your personal data in in order to fulfil a legal obligation specified in applicable law (EU or EEA member state) or to protect our legitimate interest. We will inform you about this and we will attempt to balance our interests against your rights and freedoms before processing.
As it is in our legitimate interests to be responsive to you and to ensure the proper functioning of our products and organisation, we will use your information to:
• communicate with you;
• administer and provide services and customer support per your request;
• personalise our services for you;
• enforce terms of use of our Website, Chat and Lisk services;
• if you have opted in to marketing, communicate with you about products, services, promotions, events and other news and information we think will be of interest to you; or
• provide third parties with statistical information about our users (but those third parties will not be able to identify any individual user from that information).
Technical usage information. When you visit the Website, use Chat or you use Lisk Services, we collect the information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information includes:
• your IP address;
• device information including, but not limited to, identifier, name, and type of operating system;
• mobile network information; and
• standard web information, such as your browser type and the pages you access on our Website.
We collect this information in order to:
• personalise our Website to ensure content from the Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device;
• monitor and analyse trends, usage and activity in connection with our Website and services to improve the Website;
• administer the Website and for internal operations, in order to conduct troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey analysis;
• keep the Website safe and secure; or

They allow us to recognise and count the number of users and to see how users move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the services we provide to you and the way the Website works. You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted.
