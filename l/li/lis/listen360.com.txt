“ Clients ” refers to the registered users of the Listen360 Services including Clients with both paid and free or trial accounts, on whose behalf Listen360 solicits, collects and reports voluntary feedback provided to us by the Client’s customers with respect to the Client and its products and services. Authorized users of a Client’s Listen360 paid, free, and/or demo accounts are collectively and individually referred to as “Client Users.”
Listen360 has a service provider relationship with Clients, and acts as a “data processor” when it stores, processes, transmits, or otherwise shares the consumer data it solicits and collects on behalf of the Client.  Listen360 is in a “data controller” or direct relationship with Client Users.

If you are a Respondent, Listen360 will collect and share your Personal Information solely on behalf of a Client, and solely based on the instructions provided by the Client (in conjunction with any instruction you may have the opportunity to provide at the time feedback is provided). Your agreement with the relevant Client should explain how the Client shares your Personal Information with Listen360 and other third parties, and if you have questions about this sharing, then you should direct those questions to the Client.

Hereinafter we may refer to Clients, Respondents, and Visitors individually and collectively as “you.”
COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
For purposes of this policy, “Personal Information” refers to any information about an identified or identifiable individual, including financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), and any device information that may be linked with an identifiable individual.

Listen360 does not control the policies or procedures of these Integrated Services, even though the integrations are provided through our Services, and Listen360 is not responsible for and has no control over how these third party Integrated Services function.
This Policy does not cover the collection or use of information, including consumer Respondent data, by Integrated Services, and Clients acknowledge that use and access to these Integrated Services is solely at their own risk; and Clients should consult the Terms and Privacy Policy for any Integrated Services accessed via a Listen360 account to determine how they store, process, transmit, and otherwise utilize and protect personally identifiable information and the personally identifiable information Clients provide about their customers, prospects, and other consumers. Clients ultimately can control which Integrated Services they choose to use with their Listen360 account, and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data protection requirements.
Listen360 may provide the Personal Information we have collected from and/or about Clients to Integrated Services for the purpose of enabling them to market their products or services to you, if you have not opted out of these disclosures.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any request or consent you provide, Listen360 does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit Personal Information (names, address, phone numbers, financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), etc.) submitted by Respondents to any persons or companies other than the Client on whose behalf the feedback was solicited. We reserve the right, however, to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties, at our discretion. Except as limited below, third parties may use information we share with them for any purpose for which we may use such information.
Personal Information we collect from Visitors, Clients, Client Users, and Respondents may be shared with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to, identity verification, fraud prevention, business intelligence, customer relationship management, bill collection, payment processing, marketing, hosting, and other common technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our sharing with these parties by using our Sites and Services and accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may provide information, including Personal Information of Clients and Client Users to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services, to help us communicate with you, or to provide Clients with ancillary services offered by such service providers and referral partners. We may also receive information about you, including Personal Information, from our third party service providers and referral partners. However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this Privacy Policy).
When you provide feedback about a Client via the Services, we share all of the information you provide, including Personal Information, with that Client.
When you submit any feedback form or survey, you are providing explicit consent to publically publish in any forum or format any and all of the information provided via the form (including both checkbox/radio button selections and free text comments) in conjunction with your first and last initials.
You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your Personal Information with our Affiliates. We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy. If our company or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, any personal or other information we possess may be a part of the assets transferred, and that company will possess any rights granted to us under this Privacy Policy.
Finally, in extraordinary circumstances, we may share any personal or other information we possess, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI) when necessary or appropriate to: comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; respond to subpoenas;  respond to lawful requests; comply with law or credit card rules; participate in a lawful federal, state or local government investigation; protect the rights of Listen360, other Listen360 Clients, Client Users, and Respondents, and third parties; or to investigate violations of or to enforce our Terms of Service or Terms of Use. However, in doing so, we may: (i) dispute demands for release to the extent we believe, in our sole discretion, are unwarranted, illegitimate or overbroad; and (ii) when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate, we will notify you of any requests for release.
In all cases where we share Personal Information with third parties, we will use a “minimum necessary” standard to disclose only that information required to perform the service for which the information is disclosed.
DATA RETENTION
We will retain Personal Information for Clients and Client Users as long as you remain an active user of our Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which your Personal Information was processed, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements to the extent permitted by law. While retention requirements can vary by country, we generally apply the retention periods noted below.

SECURITY
Listen360 has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our thirty party vendor’s servers which utilize the most powerful security tools that exist in the marketplace.
The Listen360 Sites, including hosted web feedback survey forms, utilize secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit GoDaddy certificate, but accommodate the majority of browsers at 128-bit encryption.
Listen360 does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via integration with third-party service providers.  These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all NACHA rules for ACH transaction processing.  This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Additionally, do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. Listen360 is not in control of your wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services.
If you believe that you have experienced unauthorized access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at privacy@listen360.com
CHOICES AND OPT-OUTS
You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the opt-out instructions we include in such communications. Any communications from us that are not Service-related or transactional in nature will offer you an “unsubscribe” option so that you can opt out of receiving such messages.
To the extent required by law, you may choose to opt out of sharing with any other parties with whom we may share your personal information; however, you may be unable to use the Services or certain features if you wish to limit such sharing.

Clients and Client Users may access and modify Personal Information and other account information using the account settings page. You may also access, change and modify information previously provided or collected by sending an email to Listen360 at privacy@listen360.com to initiate changes or modifications or to obtain a file for review.

Clients (and authorized representatives of Clients on behalf of Client Users) may request that their Personal Information be removed from all Listen360 systems. To have any Personal Information permanently deleted from Listen360 systems, you must make an official request in writing by emailing privacy@listen360.com and include the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from Listen360 systems. Note that if you request removal of your Personal Information you will no longer have access to any existing Listen360 account and will not be able to use any Listen360 product or service. Listen360 reserves the right to retain certain account information for its recordkeeping or compliance purposes.
Visitors and any other individuals who have submitted Personal Information directly to Listen360 via the Sites may request that their Personal Information be removed from all Listen360 systems once per year. To have your Personal Information permanently deleted from Listen360 systems, you must make an official request in writing by emailing privacy@listen360.com and include specific information that you would like permanently deleted from Listen360 systems. Listen360 reserves the right to retain certain account information for its recordkeeping or compliance purposes.
Respondents and other consumers who do business with Clients utilizing Listen360 Services can request that the Client provide you with access to the Personal Information Listen360 stores on its behalf, that it make changes to that Personal Information, and/or that the Personal Information be deleted from Listen360 systems. Listen360 cannot honor such requests directly from Respondents and other consumers, but will assist Clients with honoring them in a timely manner.
If you are a patient, customer, or otherwise do business with a Covered Entity that utilizes Listen360 systems to obtain and store your Personal Information or to obtain and store feedback from you, you can request that the Covered Entity provide you with access to the Personal Health Information (PHI/ePHI) stored in Listen360 systems on its behalf, that it make changes to that ePHI, and/or that the ePHI be deleted from Listen360 systems.

Note that use of the system delete function by a Client to remove any data related to Respondents or potential Respondents (such deleting a record or deleting feedback comments), or to remove any personal data about your company or its authorized Client Users, only restricts viewing that data from any system interface and prevents utilizing that data for any system function. It does not permanently delete the data from Listen360 systems. To have any personal data permanently deleted from Listen360 systems, you must make an official request in writing, to the address provided below or by emailing privacy@listen360.com that includes the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from Listen360 systems.

Our Relationship to You. Listen360 is a data controller with regard to any personal information directly collected from Visitors, Clients, or Client Users of its Sites and Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions are our service providers and are “data processors.”
Listen360 acts as a service provider to Clients and is a “data processor” with regard to any consumer Personal Information imported by Clients or Client Users into our systems via our Services—whether that consumer Personal Information is entered directly into our systems by the consumer as a Respondent, entered or imported by an authorized Client User, or imported by an authorized Client third party integration. As a “data processor” Listen360 does not have any direct control over the purposes for which and the manner in which any Respondent or potential Respondent personal information is processed; instead processing of this Personal Information is governed by data processing agreements between Listen360 and our Clients.

You right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.
Notification to Third Parties.
