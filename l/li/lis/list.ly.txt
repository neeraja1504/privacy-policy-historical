Privacy Policy - Listly
Last Updated: May 25, 2018
Our Privacy Policy explains how Listly collects, uses, and discloses information about you. The terms “Listly,” "we," "us," and "our" include TwtPickin Inc. and our affiliates. We use the terms “user,” “you,” and “your” to mean any person using our website and associated tools (“Platform”), including any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf.  This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of information about users and other individuals that we collect when you use our Platform, or services we offer, or when you communicate with us. For information about choices that we offer under this policy, please see “Your Choices” below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information that you may provide to third parties, such as users, and others with whom you may share information about yourself.
1. Information We Collect And Receive
Listly may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“Other”) in a variety of ways.  Certain visitors to Listly and websites with embedded Listly lists choose to interact with the lists in ways that require Listly to gather personally-identifying information.  The amount and type of information that Listly gathers depends on the nature of your interaction.
1.1 Information You Provide To Us
We ask users who sign up to Listly to provide a username and email address.  If you use your Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking site (‘SNS’) account information to sign in to Listly, we will collect and store your SNS user ID and related information.  Users that purchase a paid version of the Platform provide Listly (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address
1.2 Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Platform
Platform Content. You may also create a public or private list on Listly, contribute to someone else’s list by voting, commenting, and adding items. These contributions are publicly viewable on Listly, along with their name.  This information may be searched by search engine and republished elsewhere on the Web.
Platform Metadata. When an authorized user interacts with the Platform, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way you interact with the Platform content and other users. For example, Listly logs the lists you visit, people you follow, content and links you interact with, the content you shared, and what third party services are used (if any).
Log Data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data
Device Information. We collect information about the computer or mobile device that you use to access our Platform, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
Location information. We receive information from you or other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Listly may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device. This helps us customize the site content based on your approximate location.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. We and our service providers collect information using various technologies, including cookies and pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels). Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Platform and your experience, and track usage of our Platform.

If you register or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to some of your third-party account information from that service, such as your name and other information in that account, and used for purposes such as improving your Listly recommendations. We may also have access to third-party account information if you use the Platform feature to share a link.
