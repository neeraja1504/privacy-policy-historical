Registration
In order to add links to this website, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about updates and changes on our site that affect them, and verify user modifications to listings.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates (with the exception of classifieds and forums, in which cookies are used only to store user preferences and determine which messages are new since their last visit).
If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
