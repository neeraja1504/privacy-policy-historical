A detailed explanation about what web cookies are and what they do
A cookie on the web is a text file that a website’s computer asks your computer to store that file. The text file will then sit on your computer’s hard drive. Information we collect on that data includes statistics such as your time of visit, what you looked at and how long you stayed on a page. Cookies are useful for website owners and advertisers to better understand you. If you are one of the people who complain about not seeing target advertising, you should seriously consider allowing permissions for cookies. It’s the cookie that pings back keywords to ad sources which then try and match those keywords with a subject you are interested in. A person like yourself always has control on allowing or disabling cookies; however, turning the cookies off will result in it being impossible for us and our advertising partners such as Google to know what might interest you. You can read up on more information about cookies here: https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/

Most people don’t mind, but if you are one of the people who dislike it, you can block the cookies from your browser Settings. In case you don’t already know, a browser is what you use for browsing the internet. While many think that Internet Explorer is the ‘Internet’, it’s really just one way to browse the Internet.
