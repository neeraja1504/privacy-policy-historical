Where possible, HostPapa uses industry-standard SSL encryption when communicating your data. HostPapa also ensures that all customer websites have free access to SSL certificates from“Let’s Encrypt.”
However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed 100% secure.

How we use cookies
HostPapa uses “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize HostPapa pages, or register with a HostPapa site or service, a cookie helps HostPapa recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same HostPapa website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the HostPapa features that you customized.
Some cookies are necessary for HostPapa sites to work properly, such as the cookies which indicate you’ve successfully logged into your account. Some cookies, like the ones used by Google Analytics, help us see how visitors use our sites. Others are used to customize your advertising experience. If you visit a HostPapa website with a browser that has cookies enabled, you are letting us know that you agree to us using cookies with your browser.
You can modify your browser settings to delete or block cookies. You will need to see the “Help” section of your browser for instructions on how to do this. You could also install plugins that block or manage cookies. If you do decide to limit your browser’s ability to use cookies, please remember that HostPapa sites may not function properly.
Information collected by our customers
HostPapa customers may collect data from people who visit their sites, regardless of whether a purchase is made. HostPapa customers are responsible for ensuring they are complying with all legal and privacy regulations, including but not limited to the European GDPR.
HostPapa does not have a direct relationship with our customers’ visitors or users.
If you would like to make any requests regarding personal information that has been collected by a HostPapa customer, please contact them directly. This applies to any kind of request, whether to access, correct, amend, or delete information. If the customer asks HostPapa to remove any personal information we will respond within thirty (30) days.
Links to Third-Party Sites
You may be able to access other websites that have links on HostPapa websites, where you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials or new product updates. In many of these cases, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, email address, or other contact information, or credit/billing information. If you complete an order or provide personal information to a website or service that is not provided by HostPapa, HostPapa has no control over the third party’s use of any personal information. HostPapa therefore has no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use, disclose, secure, or otherwise deal with your personal information. HostPapa provides these links to other websites as a convenience to you. Please exercise care when visiting linked websites, which will have separate and independent privacy policies.
Social Sign-in
We provide you with the ability to log in to your account using social media services such as Facebook, Google+, or Twitter. If you choose to use this feature, the service you select will prompt you for your consent to share some personal information. We will store that information in order to give you access to your account.
If you no longer want to use social sign-in, you can disable it in the My Profile section of the HostPapa Dashboard.
