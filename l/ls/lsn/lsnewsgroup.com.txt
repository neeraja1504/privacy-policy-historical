Privacy Policy
Comments and E-mails
As of January 16, 2012, this site is owned by LS News Group (LSNG)/Larry Sinclair LLC. I am the founder, chairman, and 100 percent owner of LS News Group/Larry Sinclair LLC. In order to register to post comments, you must provide LSNG/Larry Sinclair LLC with a valid e-mail address. LSNG/Larry Sinclair LLC will retain that e-mail address on its servers. You may also provide other information such as your name. This too will be retained on /LSNG/Larry Sinclair LLC’s server. However, LSNG/Larry Sinclair LLC won’t share any of this information with anyone except its contractors and under certain extraordinary circumstances as described below. LSNG/Larry Sinclair LLC will cancel your registration and block you from re-registering with that e-mail address if you violate its terms of use.
If you send me an e-mail, your e-mail address typically will be displayed at the top of your message. I retain most of the messages I receive, so your address likely will remain on record in my e-mail archives. These archives are stored on servers owned by a third party (currently Hostmonster, Inc)
