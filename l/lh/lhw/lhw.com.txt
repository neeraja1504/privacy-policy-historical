EU - U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework
With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area (“ EEA ”) and Switzerland, LHW participates in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, the “ Framework ”) as set out by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of Personal Information from the European Union and Switzerland.

Your Rights Concerning your Personal Information

Cookies and Similar Technologies. Please review your browser or computer settings for certain cookies and see below to exercise certain choices regarding cookies.
You are not required to provide all Personal Information identified in this Privacy Policy to use our Site, but certain aspects of our Site will not be available to you.

You are solely responsible for any use of your The Leaders Club account via your email and password.
Retention and Storage of Your Information
We will maintain Personal Information for as long as we are required to do so by applicable law(s), or for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) described above for which it is processed. We will delete Personal Information when it is no longer needed and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which LHW is subject) and, in any case, upon expiration of the maximum storage term set forth by applicable law.
Children
LHW does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16, and users under the age of 16 should not submit any Personal Information to LHW.

These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
