Is my information secure?
Lugz believes in providing a safe and secure shopping experience for all of our customers. We want you to feel comfortable that personal information such as credit card number will be kept safe throughout your entire shopping experience at Lugz’s Online Store.For added safety we do not store credit card information on our web server. This significantly reduces the chances of Internet credit card fraud. Unfortunately, this also means that on future orders you will have to tell us your credit card information again. We apologize for the inconvenience, but believe the safety benefits warrant this action.It is our policy to never send private information such as your credit card number via email. In fact, this is a policy we recommend you adopt in all of your Internet activities.We designed the Lugz Online Store to accept credit card information only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology; for example, 3.0 versions or higher of Netscape Navigator and versions 3.02 or higher of Internet Explorer. This means you’ll be unable to inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection.

Jack Schwartz Shoes, Inc. (“Lugz”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Lugz.com web site.

Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. Lugz.com collects IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on Lugz.com. Lugz does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address).

Lugz.com will not disclose your personal identifiable information to any third party unless we tell you otherwise when asking for it.
