How does Luggage Online use cookies?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide tailored information from our web site and store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can change the settings in your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
A special note concerning children’s privacy.
The safety of children is obviously very important to us. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. Luggage Online does not knowingly collect or maintain information at our website from those who are under 18.
Is there anything else I should know?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas – that information can be collected and used by others. In addition, the privacy policies of other websites will vary, while many will have no stated privacy policy.
In short, if you provide personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. It is ultimately your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your personal information to the extent you feel comfortable. We encourage you to be careful and to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
