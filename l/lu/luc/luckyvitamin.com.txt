Privacy Policy - LuckyVitamin
At LuckyVitamin.com we protect your privacy as if it were our own. We use the information you provide to us for three purposes only: to process your order(s), to reply to your questions and provide our newsletter via email, and to incorporate your feedback into improvements to our Web site. We will not give, sell, or rent your personal information or specific account activity to anyone for any reason except as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
Our Secure Ordering
LuckyVitamin.com. uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the privacy of your personal information. When you make an online purchase, our advanced security technology encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card number) before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than LuckyVitamin.com, Inc. to read it. To further protect your information, we utilize the security. In addition, unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.
To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), the SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the location line or your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through a secure server like the ones we use at LuckyVitamin.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-888-635-0474 or you can fax or mail in your order using our printable order form. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. At LuckyVitamin.com we want you to feel completely comfortable. If you have more questions about our security systems, please call 1-888-635-0474 and we will be happy to help you.
Credit Card Fraud Protection
All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. LuckyVitamin.com will protect you for this $50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company.
Optional Phone, Fax & Mail Ordering
If you are still skeptical about placing your order online, you may place your order over the phone at 1-888-635-0474, via fax at 610-635-0472 or mail your order in and we will process your order during normal business hours Monday-Friday when we receive it.

Third-party relationships.

We occasionally run our own online surveys and we ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our company. You may opt-out of the survey and also opt-out of any future mailings at the time of the survey.
