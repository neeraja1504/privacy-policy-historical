When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous for that activity.

provide you with product information

market products to you
send you email notices or newsletters at your request*
communicate with you for other purposes

personally identifiable information to third parties without your permission.

In the event of a data breach, a notification will appear on the website within 72 hours of the breach.
When we contract with other companies to provide us with web services, we only share personally identifiable information with those that we believe share our commitment to privacy and information security. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties and your use of the site is subject to Lubrizol’s Terms of Use.
Lubrizol is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in posting comments, discussion forums or other publicly accessible interactions.
