This includes personal information under our control, as well as personal information that we may transfer to our affiliates or third party service providers for processing or other purposes that facilitate our business operations.

We collect aggregate information regarding open rates, page views, and generated sales from our HTML emails. Aggregate information does not personally identify individuals. Subscribers concerned about collection of aggregate information may unsubscribe in the manner described above.
Consent
Depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the information, we may obtain your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in different ways. Express consent may be obtained verbally, online or in writing. Implied consent may be obtained when you approach us to obtain information, inquire about or order products or services from us, or through your use of a product, service or the Website.

Retention of Personal Information
Lush will retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of the identified purposes, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. Lush will take reasonable steps to destroy, erase or render anonymous personal information that is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes.
Security of Personal Information
Lush has implemented security safeguards, appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, to protect personal information in our control against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. These security safeguards include organizational, technical and physical measures.
Any personal information you provide to Lush on the Website during the ordering process is exchanged on a secure server. We use an advanced security system, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, to encrypt, or encode, information you send to us in the order process. The encryption process protects information, such as your credit card number, and billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent from your computer. Only once we receive your information is it decoded, and we use all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our own systems.
If you create an account on the Website, your account information is protected by the password you use to access your online account. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Lush will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or email messages).
Warning: Email is not a secure means to send personal information, as it is not encrypted. We strongly encourage you to use our secure ordering process when ordering online. Nevertheless, Internet or wireless communications are never completely private or secure and there is always a risk that any messages or information you send to or through the Website may be intercepted by others.
You should also be aware that certain aspects of the Website are not confidential and are available for public viewing. For example, any submissions that you post to any publicly available online forum or blogs or other publicly available features of the Website are not confidential and may be viewed by other users of the Website. By making personal information publicly available where the Website allows you to do so, you consent to such publication by Lush or its service providers. Please refer to the Terms of Use for additional provisions relating to user submissions that may apply to you.
Lush has arranged with PowerReviews, Inc. (d/b/a Buzzillions) ("Power Reviews") to facilitate the collection of customer product reviews on products sold by Lush. When you submit a product review to Lush, you are also subject to PowerReviews' terms of use and privacy policies. Accordingly, you should review those policies prior to submitting a review. Also, reviews you submit may be posted on both Buzzillions.com and www.lush.ca.
Accuracy of Personal Information
We strive to ensure that any personal information we use and retain is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. We do not routinely update personal information unless necessary for these purposes. Nonetheless, if our records regarding your personal information are inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend that information at your request. Requests for correction of your personal information should be directed to the Lush Privacy Officer at the address below. Lush account holders and subscribers to Lush e-news or the Lush Times catalogue may also update their contact information at any time by using our online subscriber services in My Account to do so.
Access To Information
At your request, we will provide to you a statement explaining the extent to which we hold personal information about you and how that information has been used or disclosed by us. You may also request access to your personal information in our custody or control. In order to verify that the information is being released to the proper individual, you may be asked to provide suitable identification or to otherwise identify yourself. If we are unable to provide you with a list of organizations to which we have actually disclosed your personal information, we will provide you with a list of organizations to which we may have disclosed your personal information. In certain circumstances, access to personal information may be denied. If we deny your request for access, we will advise you of the reason for the refusal. Requests for access should be directed to the Lush Privacy Officer at the address below.

Lush reserves the right, in its discretion, to change this privacy policy at any time and from time to time. All changes will be posted to the Website and will apply to any personal information collected on or after the date posted.
