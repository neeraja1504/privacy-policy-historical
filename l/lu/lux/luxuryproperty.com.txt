COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
Personal Information
We only collect your personal information from you when you voluntarily submit your data, for example where you: a) submit an enquiry on a specific property or development; b) submit a general enquiry through the “Enquire” button; c) request support to sell your home and d) submit your information through the contact us page.
Your personal information is accessible only to employees of Luxury Property LLC, who have a need to know it. It will not be available for public inspection without consent. Any user providing us with their personal information has a right to examine, change or correct that information.
Non-Personal Information
Even if you do not send us any Personal Information, we collect information about how you use our site ("Non-Personal Information"). This information cannot identify you personally and is used to improve our site performance. This type of information can include IP (internet protocol) address, name of your ISP (internet service provider), browser types, user journey to arrive out our site, time spent on pages and page preferences. This information is transmitted to us as a cookie. Cookies are commonly used across the internet to improve the performance of websites and increase user experience. A cookie is a small file that includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. But if you refuse cookies, some parts of the Site will not function properly and may not provide services or information you have requested. For example, without cookies, we will not be able to provide you with searches that you have asked us to save.
We use Non-Personal Information to customise the experience and advertising that you experience on our site. It helps to improve our service and website performance, but cannot be used to identify you.
USE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTIES
We reserve the right to share your Personal Information with our marketing partners as permitted by law, in order to fulfil our commitment to providing you with full-service real estate brokerage services. We do share your Personal Information under the following circumstances:
Third party vendors we engage to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting, website development, and support, have access to Personal Information, but they have agreed not to disclose the Personal Information or to use it for any purpose other than providing the requested services.
There may arise special circumstances where it is necessary for us to disclose and use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, such as: to enforce this Privacy Statement or any other part of our Terms of Use; to protect our property or rights; to protect the safety of anyone; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or improper activities; to carry out a merger or consolidation with another entity, a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or any similar transaction; or for other reasons we determine in good faith are necessary, appropriate, or required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal or administrative process.
This website contains links to third-party websites. We provide these links solely for information and convenience. When you link to an outside application or website, you are leaving Luxury Property LLC’s website and our Privacy Policy no longer applies.
Our hosting service maintains its systems in accordance with reasonable industry standards to reasonably secure the information of its customers against unauthorised access, accidental or intentional manipulation, and loss. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and you use the Site at your own risk.
