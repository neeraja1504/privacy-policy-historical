It is optional for you to engage in such activity, however, if you choose to do so, we may require that you provide us certain Personal Information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is required and some is voluntary. If you do not provide required information for a particular activity, you may not be permitted to engage in that activity.
2.2       We may also collect certain information automatically, including through use of cookies, Web beacons and other technologies. This information may include the following: your browser and mobile device type, operating system and name of your Internet service provider; Web pages you visit on the Web site(s); IP address, browser type, profile information, geo-location information; information about your interactions with email messages, such as whether the messages were opened and the links clicked in those emails; and standard server log information.

Registered users’ user names are displayed to all users, although each verified user has the option of having his or her full name displayed to all users instead of his or her user name.

We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. We also work with third parties, such as ad networks, analytics companies and social networking platforms, and they may collect information about your online activities over time and across our sites and other online services. We require that these outside individuals and/or companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us. We may also contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to Personal Information.
4.3       If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.
4.4       We may disclose your Personal Information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site(s), to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Web site(s) or the public.
4.5       We may provide products or services jointly with certain third-party businesses, for example and without limitation, retail businesses. We may share your Personal Information with such entities to help them deliver to you purchased goods and services, and to provide you with better service and to measure our program’s value.

We will only share your Personal Information with affiliate providers with whom you engage in activities on the Web site(s).
4.6       In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets shared or transferred. If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your information will be subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the transfer or sharing of such information.
4.7       The Web site(s) may allow users to post comments and other content to the Web site(s). Any Personal Information that you post to the Web site(s) will become public information and will be accessible by other users of the Web site(s).

We have no responsibility to maintain the privacy or security of any such Personal Information that you may choose to post to the Web site(s).
4.8       Mobile phone numbers may be used to send SMS (Short Message Service), text and voice message notifications related to the Web site(s) and to communicate offers. Registered users may choose not to receive text messages from us by not providing their cell phone number to us at registration. Please note that standard message rates and data charges from your cellular service provider apply to sending and/or receiving text messages. You are solely responsible for such message rates and data charges.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
5.1       Through your use of the Web site(s), we may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from you (“NPII”). NPII is not associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. We use NPII to maintain and administer the Web site(s), analyze trends, gather demographic information and comply with applicable law. We may share this information with others without express notice to you or consent from you, and we may exploit, use and disclose your NPII without limitation of any kind.
5.2       The Web site(s) may use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site(s) that is saved on your hard drive by your computer’s browser. Cookies help us remember you when you return to the Web site(s). Cookies also hold information to personalize and enhance your experience and to gather Web site(s) statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider’s domain name and the addresses of the sites you visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Web site(s). The information in the cookies lets us trace your “clickstream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Web site(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Web site(s) are the most popular. Cookies contain absolutely no Personal Information. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Web site(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Web site(s), its content and advertising. Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (http://www.networkadvertising.org). In addition, some cookies may be placed by third- party service providers who perform some of these functions (or other services) for us. Cookies are used on this web site for the following third party services: Facebook Like and Share Button, Twitter Follow and Retweet button, Google +1 button, and if videos are embedded from sites such as YouTube or Vimeo, etc., they may set their own cookies that are beyond our control. Some of these services may be used to track your behavior on other websites and we have no control over this.
The Web site will comply with Do Not Track browser settings, where supported, for certain cookies. Cookies with a red asterisk next to their names will not be set if your browser has _  Do Not Track_ enabled, even if you have accepted cookies.
5.3       We may also use “pixel tags” (sometimes called “Web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on the Web site(s). Pixel tags help us analyze users’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Web site(s) and our advertising and marketing. We may also use other analytical tools to evaluate site performance through the use of aggregated data, which contain no Personal Information. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.
5.4       Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Web site(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Web site(s). This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the Web site(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Web site(s). We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web site(s). Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools in our emails may also be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Web site(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications, but no Personal Information is shared with them.
5.5       We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Web site(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes. We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us.
5.6       Ads appearing on the Web site(s) may be delivered to users by Us or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
5.7       We authorize certain service providers to use NPII for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies, such as to report on usage or industry trends to their customer base.
5.8       Third-Party Functionalities: The Web site(s) contains links to and/or enables certain third-party functionalities to enhance your experience on the Web site(s), including social plug-ins, tools and APIs. Prior to using any third-party functionalities (e.g., Facebook “Like” button) on the Web site(s), you should consult the privacy notices of the third-party providers of such functionalities (e.g., Facebook), as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, such third parties, or how they may use the information. The privacy policies and data practices of such third parties may significantly differ from ours, and we make no representation or warranty whatsoever about their policies and practices. Your communications and interactions with such third parties are solely between you and them, and are at your own risk.
Your Security
6.1       We strive to keep your Personal Information private and safe. We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security of Personal Information collected, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. In addition, it is our policy to never send your credit card number via email. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information, so please do not send us your credit card number by email. Any payment transactions will be encrypted.
6.2       Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. While we will use reasonable means to ensure the security of information you transmit through the Web site(s), any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties and we shall not be liable for any breach of the security of your Personal Information resulting from causes or events that are beyond our control, including, without limitation, your own act or omission, corruption of storage media, defects in third-party data security products or services, power failures, natural phenomena, riots, acts of vandalism, hacking, sabotage, or terrorism and we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website(s).

Such other Web site(s) are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for their information, products or activities.
7.2       In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other Web site(s). If you provide Personal Information at one of those Web site(s), you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that Web site(s), not our Privacy Policy. Please make sure you understand any other Web site’s privacy policy before providing Personal Information.

You further agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief or to combine or aggregate similar claims or unrelated transactions. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
