We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
Cookies
We use cookies to collect information that allows us to optimize our web site for an optimal user experience. We also use cookies for social media sharing and content remarketing. Finally, cookies are used to remember user preferences and to enable our live web site chat functionality.
Cookies are essential to the functionality of those parts of our web site that require a login. Disabling cookies may render these web portals non-functional.
Visitors to the LuxSci web site from the EU have the option to control their cookie preferences. Non-essential cookies are not set until you explicitly opt into cookie use. LuxSci permits you view and change your cookie preferences on demand. These preferences are unique to your browser and last up to 1 year, or until you explicitly clear your cookies. In your cookie preferences you can enable or disable use of cookies related to site "preferences" (i.e., functionality such as web chat and site usage history), "analytics" (i.e., functionality that allows us to optimize our site performance), and "marketing" (i.e., functionality that enables social media sharing and other cross-site information transfer).
Social Media (Features) and Widgets
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a RSS Blog Feed, Widgets, a "Share This" button and interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
You can opt in or out of the use of social media features by enabling or disabling use of "marketing" cookies.
Behavioral Targeting
We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking Here and Here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
You can opt in or out of behavioral targeting by enabling or disabling use of "marketing" cookies.
Newsletters
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you ways to unsubscribe.
Choice/Opt-out
We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments and to protect against fraud.

In this case, your credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way on the US-based servers of our trusted partner, Authorize.net

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using transport-layer security (TLS).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Some of our blogs (e.g. LuxSci Status) are managed by a third party application that may require you to register. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog.

You agree that Lux Scientiae may disclose any and all of your information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, etc., to any law enforcement agent who makes a verified written request, without further consent or notification to you. LuxSci will verify the legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine if compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law.

Confidentiality
Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data without Customer's explicit consent:
Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the sending or connecting computers, and any message header information removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization.

Databases: The content of all databases hosted by Customer in its web hosting account.

Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.
Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of a possible violation by a client of its Acceptable Use Policy and it concludes that analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.

As stated in the High Volume AUP (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP).
