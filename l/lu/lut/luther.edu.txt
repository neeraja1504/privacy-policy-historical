Privacy | Luther College
Protecting the privacy of your personal information is important to Luther College. We respect your right to privacy and recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and confidential. We have implemented appropriate technological safeguards and usage policies to ensure that the personal information you submit to Luther College is used only for official college business.
Luther College receives your personal information solely for the purpose of establishing and maintaining our relationship with you. For that relationship to proceed as effectively and conveniently as possible, we use technology to manage and maintain your information. We will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with other individuals, private or public organizations for any purpose outside official college business. We will not share your personal information with any unauthorized third parties.
The Luther College privacy policy defines personal information as information about you that identifies you and that is not available from public sources, such as your date of birth, your Social Security Number, or an unlisted telephone number.
Our sources of personal information about you include, but are not limited to, the following:
Information we receive from you on admissions applications, correspondence, communications, and other forms.
Information received from schools you attend or formerly attended, or to which you have applied for admission.
We do not disclose any personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law. For example, we share such information with the U.S. Department of Education and state agencies. We are permitted by law to disclose personal information about you to "nonaffiliated third parties" in certain circumstances; for example, we may share your personal information as necessary to administer a transaction you have requested or to process a service on your behalf.
We restrict access to your personal information to our employees who need to know the information in order to provide service to you, such as processing your application for admission. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with federal regulations to safeguard your personal information.
