From time to time, leethax.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to leethax.net choose to interact with leethax.net in ways that require leethax.net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that leethax.net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors may optionally enter an e-mail address when leaving comments.
