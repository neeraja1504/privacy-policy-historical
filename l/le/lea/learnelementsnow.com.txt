We will never sell, rent, or otherwise abuse your e-mail address or personal details.

Here’s our full privacy policy (for anyone with the inclination to read it)…
WEB SITE TERMS OF USE AND LEGAL NOTICES
Wow! You actually came to this page. Our lawyers made us include it and made us use a precious button on our home page to get you here. At first, we thought the lawyers were a real pain. But then we read the page. What a Netwakening! It’s really important stuff. We took the legalese the lawyers wrote and translated it into readable English. So be a smart nethead and read the stuff on this page. It could prevent you from hearing from our lawyers, or worse yet, from really nasty people, like prosecutors.
OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We collect information from online visitors who ask to be on our newsletter mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements or free reports. Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time. Each email will always contain a simple unsubscribe link.

Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer:
Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.
Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
