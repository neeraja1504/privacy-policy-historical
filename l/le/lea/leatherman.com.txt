Personal Information
Personal Information is information that identifies you as an individual. We collect personal information, such as name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, birthdate, payment information (including payment card number or online payment service number) and related information.

The personal information you provide will vary based upon the context, and we will not collect your personal information unless you make it available. Much of the Website is accessible without providing any personal information. As a result, you do not have to provide personal information to us to visit our Website. However, in order to set up an account, place an order or to take advantage of certain features of the Website, such as product registration or to sign up for newsletters, we may require that you furnish personal information. If you do not provide your personal information, you will not be able to use these areas or features of the Website.

By providing your personal information to us, you grant us permission to use this information consistent with this Notice and to contact you about selected products, services, and events and to provide to you other information we think may interest you. Your provision of requested personal information to us through the Website or other means is presumed by us to be voluntary and with your consent to the uses described in this Notice.
In addition, you may provide information about another person on or through this Website. For example, you must provide information about another person when you request that we ship an order to another person. If you provide information about a person other than yourself, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by that person to provide this information to us.

Social Sign On. You may elect to use your social media credentials to log into your account on the Website. If you do, we may receive from the social media platform the information on the applicable permissions page that you permit the social media platform to share now or in the future. When you engage with the social media platform, you are interacting with a third party, not Leatherman. Leatherman does not endorse and has no control over that social media platform. The information you share with the social media platform is subject to the privacy policy and privacy settings on that social media platform. Leatherman makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the social media platform or any other third party website or application (including the accuracy, reliability or completeness of information supplied or the privacy practices thereof).

Advertising Networks. We may work with advertising networks that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of such advertisements using information collected through cookies, web server logs and web beacons. This information is used to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our Affiliates and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on this Website and on third-party websites that participate in the advertising networks. We do not provide any personal information to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.
Many companies that collect information for behavioral advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI offers the ability for you to opt-out of the behavioral advertising programs of their members by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp or http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that if you use a different computer, change your web browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew all of your opt-out choices.
We do not provide any Personal Information to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements. Click here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative website to learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out from each of those listed.
Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising but only excludes you from interest-based advertising. If you use the Leatherman website or Affiliate websites, you will continue to receive generic advertisements.
Your Choices; Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information. You are able to make certain choices about how we communicate with you and the information we collect from you and share with third parties.

Your California Privacy Rights.
