We Protect Your Information
Our terms of use and privacy policy extends online to our website, and our primary focus is providing free information and web tools for students and non-profits across the globe. When a website chooses to use our tools and resources they are doing so without financial charge, and without providing personal information.
In an effort to remain transparent, here our more details on our data policies. LearnHowToBecome.org does collect two kinds of information from those who use our site: submitted information and automatic information.
AUTOMATIC INFORMATION is anonymous information that is automatically cataloged as you interact with our site. Examples of this type of data includes, but is not limited to, your browser version, operating system version, and your computer's IP address. This data helps us improve user experience, such as creating more compatable pages or more relevant, tailored content. We use “cookies” to collect this anonymous data for analytics, site optimization and customized advertising and marketing campaigns.
As a user of LearnHowToBecome.org, you acknowledge and agree that this automatic data may be shared with schools, affiliated companies, and third parties for the purpose of providing information about degrees, programs and other education-related products and services.

Examples of this data may include any personal contact information you provide, such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address.

Any communication you may receive any email from us, a school, or third party, will also provide the ability to unsubscribe through a link in the email. If you choose to unsubscribe, you will be removed from further mailings from that sender.
In circumstances required by law, we also retain the right to release your personal information. This may include such instances as to abide by a subpoena or other legal preceeding. This will be when, in good faith, we believe it is necessary to preserve our rights, ensure the safety of you or others, explore alleged fraud, to reply to a government or legal request, and/or in the instance that LearnHowToBecome.org is merging, acquisitioning, or selling some or all of its assets to a third party.
