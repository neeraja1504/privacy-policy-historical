We collect this personal information only from those individuals/entities that choose to participate.
We use this information to process requests for products and services.

In addition, we use the personal information that you provide, other than your Sensitive Information, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
Supplementation of Information

Sharing of Your Information
Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for LeadsMarket.com.

Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Website

Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third-party website through which you access the Website(s). If personally identifiable information may be provided to such a third party, we will inform you at the point of collection and provide you with an opportunity to tell us not to share your personally identifiable information.
