C. EU–US Privacy Shield
1. What is the EU-US privacy Shield?
In order to allow for export of personal data covered under the GDPR towards a US recipient, the GDPR requires that certain safeguards are put in place first. Under section 45 of the GDPR, such safeguards may be established by a so-called “adequacy decision” to be taken by the European Commission.
On July 12, 2016, the European Commission, through the “Commission implementing decision (EU) 2016/1250”, has accepted that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield ensures an adequate level of protection for Personal Data transferred from the EEA to organisations in the United States, to the extent covered under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please see https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview.
