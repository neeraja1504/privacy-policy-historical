Opting Out

In Android devices, End Users can activate the “Opt out of interest-based ads” setting. For example, you can do this by going to “Settings” on the device; select “Google Settings”; select “Ads”; and check the box labelled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Ads”. Please note that even if you opt-out, you will still receive advertising but these ads will not feature interest-based ads that may be more relevant to you.
