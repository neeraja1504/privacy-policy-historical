Your Rights and Choices
You can request that:
your details not be used for marketing purposes;
we provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;
we correct inaccuracies in your information.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strengthens your rights over how companies use your data.
We ensure Data Subjects rights under the GDPR are protected by ensuring a data subject can request:
The right to be informed  | The right to be informed encompasses our obligation to provide ‘fair processing information’, typically through a privacy notice. It emphasises the need for transparency over how we use personal data of individuals.
The information we supply about the processing of personal data must be:
concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible;
written in clear and plain language, particularly if addressed to a child; and
free of charge.
---|---
The right of access  |
Individuals have the right to access their personal data and supplementary information. This is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR).
The right of access allows individuals to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.
Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:
confirmation that their data is being processed;
access to their personal data; and
other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided in a privacy notice.
We must provide a copy of the information free of charge. However, we can charge a ‘reasonable fee’ when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.
Information must be provided without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt. We will be able to extend the period of compliance by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous.
Certain data may not be disclosed where a relevant exemption applies. We will provide an explanation and a right of appeal in these circumstances.
Where we are not the Data Controller, we will forward the request to the Data Controller and otherwise assist in answering the request, where appropriate. For example, where we are a Data Processor we will provide information we hold on behalf of the Data Controller to the Data Controller within a reasonable amount of time to allow them to respond to the request within the statutory time limits.
For more information about SAR process, please refer to learndirect Subject Access Request process.
The right to rectification  |
The GDPR gives individuals the right to have personal data rectified.
Personal data can be rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
We must respond within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request for rectification is complex.
If we cannot take any action in response to a request for rectification, we must explain why to the individual, informing them of their right to complain to the supervisory authority (ICO) and to a judicial remedy.
The right to erasure  |
The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.
The broad principle behind this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.
Individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:
Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;
When the individual withdraws consent;
When the individual objects to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing;
The personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR);
The personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.
We can refuse to comply with a request for erasure where the personal data is processed for the following reasons:
to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
to comply with a legal obligation for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
for public health purposes in the public interest;
archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes; or
the exercise or defence of legal claims.
The right to restrict processing  |
Individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.
When processing is restricted, we are permitted to store the personal data to comply with legal or contractual obligations, but not further process it.
We can retain just enough information about the individual to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
We will be required to restrict the processing of personal data in the following circumstances:
Where an individual contests the accuracy of the personal data, we should restrict the processing until we have verified the accuracy of the personal data;
Where an individual has objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a public interest task or purpose of legitimate interests), and we are considering whether our organisation’s legitimate grounds override those of the individual;
When processing is unlawful and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead;
If we no longer need the personal data but the individual requires the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;
We must inform individuals when we decide to lift a restriction on processing.
The right to data portability  | The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.
It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.
The right to data portability only applies:
to personal data an individual has provided to a controller;
where the processing is based on the individual’s consent or for the performance of a contract; and
when processing is carried out by automated means;
We must provide the personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form. Open formats include CSV files. Machine readable means that the information is structured so that software can extract specific elements of the data. This enables other organisations to use the data.
We must respond without undue delay, and within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request is complex or we receive a number of requests. We must inform the individual within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary.
The information must be provided free of charge.
The right to object  | If a data subject believes that the processing of personal information about them is causing, or is likely to cause, substantial and unwarranted damage or distress to them or another person, they may notify the organisation in writing to request learndirect to put a stop to the processing of that information.
Individuals have the right to object to:
processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
direct marketing (including profiling); and
processing for purposes of scientific/ historical research and statistics.
We must stop processing the personal data unless:
we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual; or
the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
We must inform individuals of their right to object “at the point of first communication” and in our privacy notice. This must be “explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information”.
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling | The GDPR applies to all automated individual decision-making and profiling. This may be not applicable to learndirect if we are not using any automated means to process personal data.
Automated individual decision-making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement)
Profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual). Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process.
We can only carry out this type of decision-making where the decision is:
necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract; or
authorised by Union or Member state law applicable to the controller; or
based on the individual’s explicit consent.
You may also turn cookies off in your browser. However if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features on the website. (More information).

Third parties and sponsors
To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to share your information and Learner File with our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course with a service provider in a learndirect centre, the service provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which learndirect courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these learndirect courses to help us deliver our services to you.  In a limited number of circumstances it may be necessary to allow a new Service Provider access to all your personal information for example if your existing Service Provider no longer provides learndirect services.
We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the learndirect business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.
Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by learndirect staff to check the quality of tutor support. learndirect staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.
Referral Partners
If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we may be required by the referral partner to provide them with updates on the following areas:
Attendance
Progress
Achievement/completion
Outcome/destination
Withdrawal
Job Centre Plus Referrals
If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.  We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.  You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing.  When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.  In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from www.direct.gov.uk.
Keeping you informed
We, and our approved service providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about:
our services and materials;
additions to the website; and
specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.
If you enrol on a learndirect course you will periodically be sent customer feedback surveys.  If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes untick the relevant boxes on the ’contact permissions’ page. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using “edit your details” on your learner home page.
If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the “request more information” page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on 0800 101 901 or email us.
We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes without your express consent.
Funding
We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the Skills Funding Agency in England. The Skills Funding Agency may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the Welsh Assembly Government for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility. If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved service providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.
At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the Skills Funding Agency or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. You can change your choices at any time by talking to your tutor.  Please read the SFA Privacy Notice below.
We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the Department for Work and Pensions) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.
ESFA Privacy Notice 2017 to 2018
This privacy notice is issued by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department of Education (DfE). It is to inform learners how their personal information will be used by the DfE, the ESFA (an executive agency of the DfE) and any successor bodies to these organisations. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the DfE is the data controller for personal data processed by the ESFA..
How We Use Your Personal Information
Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise its functions and to meet its statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN) and a personal learning record (PLR).
Your information may be shared with third parties for education, training, employment and well-being related purposes, including for research. This will only take place where the law allows it and the sharing is in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
The English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on its behalf) may contact you in order for them to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.
You can opt out from being contacted for other purposes by choosing a relevant option in the ESFA Contact Restriction fields which will be discussed with you when you register with learndirect.
Further information about use of and access to your personal data, and details of organisations with whom we regularly share data are available at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice
Statistics
We and/or the approved service providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading ‘Funding’ and to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using learndirect, you cannot be personally identified from this information.
However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether learndirect learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled.
The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information.
Requests for information
If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.
Protecting your personal information
We are registered as a data controller (in our registered company name of learndirect Limited) in line with the UK Data Protection Act, 1998. As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information including your password is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees and sub-contractors can access. All parties with access to your information are subject to confidentiality obligations. If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the “change my password” option under “your details” on your learner home page.
Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk.
Please look at the terms and conditions on this website for our policy on purging emails and webspace. The terms and conditions tell you when we may close your account and delete all your records, files and information.
Keeping your personal data
We keep personal data and Learner Files:
for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for;
as required by law; or
to enforce or defend legal claims.
Sometimes we will keep information that you have deleted, for example messages sent by you to your tutor, as a record of your learning experience. We will keep this information for a reasonable time.
Our policy for children
Our website is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. No one whose date of birth indicates that they are under 16 years will be able to register on-line as a learner. We recommend that you put parental controls on your internet browser and supervise your children when they are online.
We will not use information collected from people under 18 for marketing purposes. In general, Government funding is not available to learners under 19 via learndirect, although there are some specific exceptions, in particular apprenticeships.  This privacy statement will apply to any learner enrolled on an apprenticeship even if you are aged between 16 and 18.
Although anyone can take part in competitions and promotions, we will send notice of a win or prize directly to the parent or guardian identified during registration. Where a winner is under 18, we will not publish his or her personal details unless we have obtained the consent of the parent or guardian during registration.

Part B
Terms applying if you enrol for a  learndirect course  at a Service Provider
These terms and conditions (‘Terms’) apply to your learning when you enrol on a  learndirect **  course in a learning centre**
learndirect **  and your learning centre**
learndirect
learndirect is the trading name of learndirect Ltd, which is the provider of your learning. That service to you includes the learndirect website, your course on the website or any learndirect off-line materials, and the learndirect learner helpline.
Your Service Provider
learndirect has contracted with your service provider to support you through enrolment, use of computers, tutor support while you are learning, and assessment for your qualification. You can learn at the learning centre or online or a mix of the two; your service provider will be able to provide you with support whichever method you use.
For the purposes of these Terms
‘ advisor’  the person who provides general support while you are learning
‘ course fee ‘ means the fee you may be asked to pay for this course.
‘ course’  means this course that you are signing up to learn. In the learndirect system it is referred to as a ‘programme’ because it usually contains more than one piece of learning, and it will prepare you for your qualification.
‘ enrol ‘ means the process of enrolling for a course.
‘ learning centre’  means the centre where you are enrolled.
‘SFA’   the Skills Funding Agency which pays for a lot of the learning.
‘Service Provider’  means the organisation contracted by learndirect Ltd to provide your services.

‘ we ‘ and  ‘us ‘ means learndirectLimited. learndirect **  is the brand name which learndirect **  Ltd uses for its learning services.

Enrolment
Your Service Provider will help you to choose the correct course. It will assess your skills and knowledge and provide advice and information before you start learning to make sure you choose the right course.
If you are eligible for government funding to pay, or help to pay, for the course, you must provide your service provider with relevant evidence about yourself and your circumstances, and we will obtain that funding for your learning.
If the SFA says that you must pay for a part of the course, your service provider will collect the fee on behalf of learndirect, and give you a receipt.
You must follow the terms and conditions of the course.
The Service Provider will not make other charges to you, or ask for any deposits, for learndirect learning.
Your Service Provider will provide you with the online course materials for the course (and off-line courses if used) and access to learndirectonline systems and the tools and resources for learners you will find there.
By accessing your course you will be deemed to have accepted these Terms and the terms and conditions of the Learning Agreement.
When you have signed the Learning Agreement with us, your Service Provider will provide you with a tutor. Your tutor will provide support and guidance to you during your course.
Your course
Your course is a mixture of online software, (or off-line course materials) tools and information on the Website, and tutor support from your service provider. The course is designed to help you to achieve the qualification you have chosen with support from your service provider.
Whether you pay a fee or not, you are not ‘buying’ the course. You are being licensed to ‘use’ the course while you are on the course. You cannot ‘keep’ the course for ever. You cannot give or sell the course or any of the learning materials to anyone else. The course always remains the property of learndirect .
Assessment :
Assessment is an important part of your course. It is the only way to get the qualification that you want when you have finished your learning. It may be the online test for maths and English, or a portfolio if you are doing a vocational qualification.
If you are doing an English or maths course, your service provider will help prepare you for your Skills for Life test, and will arrange with you a suitable time and date to take your test. There is no charge for this service.
If you are doing an NVQ, your learndirect assessor will help you prepare and submit your portfolio. Once you have been assessed and passed, you will get your certificate for your qualification.
There is no extra charge for assessment and certification.
Quality of the services
We will, (and we will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that your service provider will), use reasonable skill and care in providing the services to you. We do not make any commitment to you that the content of the services will meet any specific requirements that you have (except to the extent that your requirements match the course description which is given in more detail on the Website). We expect you to take reasonable care to make sure that the course you have chosen will meet your needs.
We do not make any commitment to you that you will obtain any particular result from your receipt of the services. We do not make any commitment to you that you will obtain any particular qualification from your receipt of the services (unless stated otherwise in the course description on the Website subject to your successful achievement of that qualification).
All representations, warranties and/or terms and/or commitments not expressly set out in these Terms and the terms and conditions of the Learning Agreement (whether implied by law, conduct, and statute or otherwise) are hereby excluded to the maximum extent permissible at law.

You will be responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. You must not allow anyone else to use your user name and password. You must tell us immediately of any unauthorised use of your user name or password or if you believe that your user name or password are no longer confidential. We reserve the right to require you to alter your user name and password if we believe that they are no longer secure. We will never email you or ask you on the phone for your password. If anyone asks you for your password you must tell your tutor or advisor.
We will provide you with access to your course once you have enrolled. You will need to log on using your user name and password to use the course.
When you first enrol for a learndirect course you will also be issued with a learner reference number. We may use this number in correspondence with you.
Course fee and funding from the Skills Funding Agency
You may be eligible to have part or the whole cost of the course paid for you by the SFA. If so, you must provide your Service Provider with the evidence we request. If you are not eligible for funding support, you will have to pay the whole cost of the course.
You agree to pay us the course fee, (including VAT where applicable), if a fee is required for the course. You may be asked to pay a course fee even if you are eligible for some funding from the Skills Funding Agency. Your advisor has explained any cost to you before you are asked to sign the Learning Agreement. The Learning Agreement shows the course fee payable by you, and you must pay that fee to us through your service provider.
Provision of the Services
Help:    You will find help with your learning in several ways. There are videos, ‘how to’ guides and frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the Website. You can send a message or speak to your advisor or tutor.
Tutor Support :  When you enrol on your course your service provider will assign a tutor to support to you through the course. Your tutor will contact you regularly to discuss your progress. You must keep in touch with your tutor at least every 3 weeks if you are going to continue on the course.
Your tutor will help you with any questions about your course. This includes how to use the course online, specialist advice about things you are learning in your course, or any other aspect of learning with learndirect. Your tutor may not be the same person every time you are learning. The tutor you speak to will know what course you are doing and will be able to see in the Website how you have progressed so far.
Tutor support will be provided on a first-come first-served basis. Tutor support at the learning centre will be available during the normal opening hours of the centre, as advertised on the learning centre entry in this Website.
Computer compatibility on your own machine : You can log onto the Website from any computer using your assigned user name and password. The computers in your learning centre have been tested to make sure they work with our courses.
However, not all computers have all the software needed to use every course learndirect provides, so we do not make any commitment that the course software will be compatible with or operate with the software or hardware on your own computer. If your computer does not have the necessary software installed you will be able to download the software from the Website (at your cost and risk) that should allow you to use the course. If it cannot, and you want to learn from home, your service provider will help you to choose another suitable course, or refund any course fee you have paid.
If we recommend that you either enable cookies or download certain publicly accessible software to ensure that your computer is capable of accessing the course, you do so at your own risk. There is a ‘How to’ guide called ‘Setting up my Computer for Learning’ on the Website. We use cookies to check the compatibility of your system with some of our services. If you wish to know more about cookies, please see the section on ‘Cookies’ in the learndirect Use of Cookies Statement.
If when you are doing your course you need to use software which is not provided as part of the course, or as a free download from the Website, you will be responsible for any charges from the software supplier.
Technical Support:  Your Service Provider will provide basic technical support to learners to help them to use our courses. Your Service Provider cannot provide technical help that is not about using your learndirectcourse. Please contact an advisor at your learning centre for technical help using the learndirect courses. There is a FAQ and a ‘How to’ guide and a contact form on the Website. We will use reasonable skill and care in providing any technical support and to ensure that this service is available to you. l earndirect  cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability of its technical support. We do not guarantee that the technical advice provided by us will resolve your technical problems.   If you decide to take advantage of such technical advice you must strictly follow that advice.
System downtime:  We may need periods of downtime to maintain the website. learndirect tries to ensure that the Website is available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. learndirect reserves the right to suspend access to the Website between the scheduled maintenance window of approximately 01:00 and 02:30 GMT each day. There may also be occasions when access to the Website is interrupted for emergency maintenance or repairs or to carry out upgrades to improve the performance or functionality of the website. Access may also be interrupted due to failures of telecommunications links and equipment which are beyond the control of learndirect .
Your right to use the course and your related obligations
On payment of the course fee, or funding approved for you on your course, we grant to you a licence for you to use the course for your own use only. This is for the sole purpose of non-commercial use by you in your learning centre, at home, at work or any other lawful location in connection with the receipt of the services. You can only use the course while you are learning, and for a period afterwards. You cannot ‘keep’ the course, and it is not yours to sell or give to anyone else.
You may make copies of sections of the course as they appear on the Website if you need to while you are doing the course for your own use only. You may print for your personal use only as many pages of the course on the Website as are reasonable for your own private study purposes.
You may not change, copy (except as permitted above), reproduce, re-publish, upload, post, transmit or distribute in any way any part of the course. Any use of the course not permitted in these Terms and the terms and conditions of the Learning Agreement is strictly prohibited. Such use will constitute an infringement of either our copyright or our other intellectual property rights, or the copyright or other intellectual property rights of people who write courses for us.
Your right to cancel the course
If you decide that you wish to cancel your enrolment, you may do so provided that you tell your service provider that you wish to cancel within 30 days of your enrolment. If you are entitled to a refund of any course fee, this will be paid to you within 30 days of the date of your cancellation.
You agree that you will lose your above right to cancel the course and get a refund of any course fee you have paid if you have started using the course. This will not affect your statutory rights.
Our rights to stop providing the services to you
We will make the course available to you in the Website from enrolment until:
you tell your tutor or advisor,  in writing, by email or by telephone that you have completed the course and no longer require access to the services or,
90 days after your  tutor marks the course as completed or achieved or,
you do not answer tutor or advisor emails or calls to you, and/or you do not do any activity in your course,  for a period of longer than 28 days  while you are on the course (unless you have agreed a break with your tutor in advance) or,
we or your service provider decide that your actions are unacceptable.
In any of the events above, we will withdraw your access to the course. If you wish to use the services after your access to the course has been withdrawn, you will need to enrol again.
We reserve the right to stop providing the services to you immediately if:
you do not follow the way in which you are allowed to use the course and the Website; or
you act in such a way as to threaten, intimidate or otherwise harass our staff or other learners; or
if you are in receipt of funding from the SFA, and you fail to comply with the requirements of the SFA as described either on this Website or in the Learning Agreement or in information given to you by learndirectwhen you enrol.
If we exercise this right your service provider will tell you by email or by your chosen route. We will then immediately withdraw your access to the course.
Complaints
If you are not satisfied with any aspect of the services, please speak to your tutor or advisor, or contact us in the manner described in ‘Contact us’ section in the learning planner.
Our liability to you
We will not be liable if we cannot provide the services to you because of an event beyond our reasonable control.

(a) If you have purchased online via the learndirect website
We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction.
The online purchase process prompts you to specify whether you are:
a) buying for yourself or
b) buying for others.
Where you have specified that you are buying for yourself, in order to access Course Materials, you will be able to access the Course Materials by logging on the website using your registration details. The Course Materials can be accessed by you through the “my courses” page of the Website.
Where you have specified that you are buying for your business, or if you have purchased multiple copies of the same Course, the website will generate a series of “Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description. We cannot extend or replace expired enrolment keys.
(b) If you have purchased by placing an order to be paid by invoice
We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction. Depending on your purchase and delivery requirements, we will fulfil your order in one of a number of ways.
These may include:
“Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the Website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired Enrolment Keys.
“Learner Management System” (LMS).” A LMS is an online system that can be used to facilitate and track course enrolments. Depending on your purchase, the access model may include:
“Specific Course Enrolments” If you have purchased a number of enrolments (an enrolment provides access to a single course for one individual learner) from a specific course range, these will be added to your LMS account for you to administer (by registering your learners and providing access to the courses). In this case the enrolments must be accessed by the individuals within 12 months and (once the enrolment has been activated) will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired enrolments.
“Pre-payment”. If you require the flexibility to select courses from across the range of products on the LMS, then you may make a pre-payment for unspecified course enrolments which will be added as a “starting balance” onto the LMS. The cost of each individual course (as shown on the LMS) is deducted from the pre-paid balance when a learner is enrolled onto that course. Your pre-payment must be used within 12 months and cannot be extended or refunded (meaning that you must “spend” your pre-payment by enrolling learners within the system to the value of the pre-payment).
c) If you purchased online Course Materials from one of our Resellers, you will be given access to the materials by the Reseller.
Please note that it is your responsibility to check that the computer you plan to use to access your Course Materials is compatible with the minimum specification requirement that relates to the Materials you are ordering. The minimum specification for each course is provided on the Website.
