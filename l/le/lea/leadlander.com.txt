Furthermore, when you contact us (online or offline) in connection with a request for information, to access a Platform, and to provide you with support, we collect personal information necessary to fulfill your request, to grant you access to the Platform, to provide you with support, and to be able to contact you.

Information we collect on behalf of our Customers
Upland may store personal information on behalf and under the instructions of our customers (“ Customers ”), which we will process as a processor (or sub-processor) on our Customers’ behalf. Note that when you are using the Platforms, Upland collects information under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct relationship with individual end-users whose personal information it processes.
Our Customers request information related to the services they provide you. This information can include personal information such as name, address, contact information, gender, date of birth, unique identifiers such as social security number, employee identification numbers, and employee records, as applicable to the services provided to you.
You can log in to some of our Platforms by using sign-in services through our Customers’ websites. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up forms.
Information we collect about your use of our Services
As is true of most websites, we automatically gather technical information about your computer when you visit our Sites or access our Platforms. This information includes your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system and general geo location (we do not collect precise geo location). We collect device identifiers such as system and performance information when you download and use our Platforms.
We may combine this automatically collected technical information with other personal information we collect about you.  We do this to improve marketing and analytics.
Use of Personal Information
We use personal information to:
Provide, maintain, improve, and protect the Sites and Platforms
Resolve technical issues, and respond to customer service requests

We may also use the information you provide to contact our corporate customers for marketing purposes if they elect to continue to receive such communications.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Platforms on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Platform, the events that occur within the Platform, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Platform was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the Platform.
In some cases, you can log in to our Sites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name and email address to pre-populate our signup form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Sites to your profile page to share with others within your network.

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Platforms or other services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the terms of the service agreements we have in place with our Customers.
We use your personal information to send transactional communications via email, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Platform to help you become more proficient in using that Platform.

Information Sharing
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We may provide your personal information to third parties who are acting on our behalf or assist us in providing services to you, such as data storage, maintenance services, hosting services, database management, web analytics and payment processing providers. We do not allow these third parties to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. For a list of the processors that Upland Software utilizes, visit https://uplandsoftware.com/upland-software-third-party-subprocessors/.
Such third parties are subject to this privacy statement in addition to certain contractual obligations with respect to the use of your personal information. Notwithstanding such legal and contractual obligations between Upland and such third parties, Upland remains potentially liable for any misuse of personal information by such third parties.
All information provided to our Customers using our Platforms is controlled by our Customers. Please refer to their privacy statement on how the information provided is shared with others.

when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
if one of the Upland affiliates or group companies is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Sites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information; and
to any other third-party with your prior consent to do so.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by Upland and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and business support service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering our Sites, tracking users’ movements on our Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, hosting service providers, and other business support service providers on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
Upland may keep a cached copy of the content you provide or disclose to us as a part of your use of the Site or Service, including media files, for an indeterminate or indefinite period of time. To assist in development, we may keep copies of HTTP requests and responses in your notification log. If your web server does not specify that we may cache your content, we will not keep a cached copy of any text or audio data transmitted through the Service during calls, but we may still maintain copies in your notification log. We may also keep call log, notification log, billing/payment, and other log data as we determine is appropriate.
Some of our web pages, e-mails, and other online content may contain electronic images provided by us or authorized third parties known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images. These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our Site, seen our ads, or opened our e-mail, and to track whether messages are shared using our social share features and, once shared, whether these messages are opened by the recipient. In addition, when you click on a link in an e-mail, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by e-mail. If you do not wish to receive web beacons by e-mail, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select text only) e-mails via your e-mail software.
We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs, such as HTML 5 and Flash, to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs, please click the link below. http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

Links to Other Websites
Our Site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Upland. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
Our Sites include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, the Share this button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Sites. These features may collect personal information, including your IP address and which page you are visiting on our website, and will set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Sensitive information, such as user name and password used during log-in, is transmitted over the Internet by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet and no method of electronic storage are 100% secure. Therefore, while best efforts are made to secure your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Sites or Platforms, you can contact us at privacy@uplandsoftware.com.
Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personal Information

We will respond to your request without undue delay and within one month of receipt of your request.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Information we collect on behalf of our Customers
Since Upland has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes, an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his or her query to Upland’s Customer (the data controller). If the Customer requests us to remove the data, we will seek to respond to the request within one month. Additional forms of identification may be required before any action is taken.

We will retain personal information that we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide services to our Customers. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Upland is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you.
