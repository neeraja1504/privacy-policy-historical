Cookies and Web Beacons
We use a variety of technologies on our Sites. Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer so that the website can remember your browser in the future.

Cookies may be used by us in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our Sites, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign, and to provide you with more relevant content. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, as well as enable us to make your visit to our website easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a customized experience.
Information gathered through usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal identifying information, unless you become a trial or paying customer of ours.

In addition, when you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by email. If you do not wish to receive web beacons by email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.
Import Wizard
The LeadOutcome import wizard uses a technology called Context.IO.

If you wish to opt-out of sharing your information with Context.IO Providers, you may do so at https://optout.context.io/ or simple don't use the feature that allows you to automatically import emails by adding your email account.
You can learn more about how we use anonymous data in our Privacy FAQ (https://context.io/privacy-faq). Basically, we redact all personally identifiable information and then use the anonymous and aggregated reports to improve spam filters, report phishing attacks, improve deliverability, etc.
