IP addresses are not usually associated with your personal computer, but with a portal through which you accessed the Internet. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. A "cookie" is a piece of information a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website to remember who you are without personally identifying you.
We may share this non-personally identifiable information only in summary form with its suppliers and other third parties for the purpose of website statistical and trend analysis.

We use "cookies" to understand our website usage and to improve the content and offerings. You can disable "cookies" through your Internet browser. If you set your browser not to accept "cookies", you will still be able to use the website. We may use web beacons to track certain websites that you visit. Web beacons are programming codes that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows us to track certain websites that you visit. Web beacons are used to track behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services that you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, we may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.
