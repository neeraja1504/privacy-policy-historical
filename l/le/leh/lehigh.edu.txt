Applicability
This Privacy Policy applies only to lehigh.edu domains and explains our practices about the collection, use, and disclosure of visitor information.
Statement of Policy
Privacy is extremely important to us. Please read the following to understand our views and practices regarding this matter and how they pertain to you. Lehigh University gathers several types of information about our visitors: data that prospective students provide when inquiring about academic programs, information about how many people visit our site, and personal contact information supplied by visitors signing up for electronic publications or newsletters created and transmitted by Lehigh University or other promotions such as our opinion surveys. Such information enables us to personalize our communications and engagement with our visitors and to help us better understand their demographics as well as their needs. Lehigh University does not share information about individual visitors with any other party, except as disclosed below. Lehigh University gathers user information in the following processes:
What information we collect
We and our third-party vendors collect certain information regarding your use of lehigh.edu, such as your IP address and browser type. Your session and the pages you visit on lehigh.edu will be tracked, but we will not attempt to identify you individually. We may use your IP address to identify the general geographic area from which you are accessing lehigh.edu. We may also collect other information as described in this policy.
How information is used
We use the information we gather from you for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention, and to track user trends, and for the other purposes described in this policy. If you send us an email, the email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. We will not share, sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use your email address for commercial purposes without your permission.
User information may be shared with third-party vendors to the extent necessary to provide and improve web services or other communications to users. For example, we use third parties such as Google Analytics to generate reports on site usage, web traffic, user behavior, and user interests in order to optimize our website for our visitors. We also use geographic, demographic, and interest-based reports of our website visitors to create custom audience lists. We prohibit any third parties who receive user information for this purpose from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services for the benefit of our users.
We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect our rights and safety and the rights and safety of our users or others.
