What Personal Information We Collect.
We collect personal information ("personal information”), like names, email addresses, comments, images and videos of your likeness etc., only when voluntarily submitted by you or your authorized users. This information may be provided in the form of videos, comments, photos or forms that contain personal information. We may offer some services on or in collaboration with other Internet web sites, or through third party applications such as gadgets or extensions. Personal information that you provide to those third-party sites may be sent to us so that we can deliver the requested service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy.

Similarly, if you use our website to share and/or distribute content (including videos, comments or other submissions), and such content contains personal information about others, such information may be stored in order to allow for such uploading, sharing and/or distribution.
How We Use and Disclose Personal Information
We only use or process personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized for use.

How We Protect Children’s Privacy.
Children under the age of sixteen can use the Recap services with parental consent using Student accounts. A Teacher can also provide consent and assume responsibility for obtaining the appropriate parental consent. Swivl does not knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use any information from any child under the age of sixteen without the appropriate consent. If a child whom Swivl knows or suspects to be under the age of sixteen sends personal information to us online without appropriate consent, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify the parents, or seek parental or other appropriate consent. Parents can at any time request deletion of data or of the entire account.
In addition, the Recap Services and information stored on Student Accounts on the Recap Services are not private or confidential between the associated teacher account, and Student account. Student users should have no expectation of privacy in any part of them. Although each Student account user has an individual password or class pin to access the Recap Services, the Recap Services and all account information created through or hosted on the Recap Services belongs to the teacher account holder and/or Swivl, and all parts of the Recap services are accessible by the teacher account holder and Swivl management and other personnel as described below in the section on Swivl Policies. The teacher account holder has the right to monitor the Recap Services and their associated Student account usage at their discretion.
Retention of Data and Authorized Data Processors
Users are responsible for determining the duration necessary to retain content for their purposes. When the purpose is complete, it is recommended that users delete the content. Note that content deleted by the user is retained for 30 days for recovery purposes due to accidental deletion (per user request) and then removed permanently from the Recap storage servers. In addition, if a users account is inactive for more than a calendar year, content will be automatically deleted using the same procedure. This insures that data is not retained any longer than is required.
We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers (sub-processors) that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include providing customer service, performing business analysis and supporting our website functionality or other services that are necessary to operate the site. We do not disclose any personal information to authorized service providers from Student Account holders beyond what is necessary to operate the site. See our List of Sub-processors.
We may share personal information from Teacher Account holders with business partners on an opt-in basis to authorized service providers to support contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website now or in the future.
How To Access and Control Your Information
You, and parents of users under the age of sixteen have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information, to request the deletion of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
