When you sign up for a LetsIntern discussion forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the Letsintern. When you use co-branded services, or those provided by a third party, within the Letsintern website, your information may be passed to the co-brand or third party provider and their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.
Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of Letsintern, such as in online forums, chat rooms or searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom Letsintern has no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of this website.
Letsintern may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral and preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in receiving email or other communications about particular products or services.
We believe that managing your career is a life-long process. Hence, we retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can correct or update your account profile and resume at any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume from our online database or close your account at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of your resume and your account profile information except for an archival copy which is not accessible on the internet.
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Letsintern as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
received your permission;
given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.
Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.
