Thomas Fuchs
Terms of Service (User Agreement) | Privacy Policy | Data Security | GDPR Data Processing Agreement
At Noko, we collect and manage data according to the following Privacy Policy (last update March 31, 2019).
TL;DR
Your data is yours & you can change or delete it at any time.
We never share any information about your projects, entries or customers, with anyone unless you explicitly allow us to.
To provide better service, we share some statistical data and some personal information with third parties.
You can opt out of sharing your email address with the tools we use to track errors and performance issues; however if you do we can’t proactively contact you if you run into an error. To opt-opt, go to the Privacy tab in Settings & Profile.
You’re welcome to use content blocking software (e.g. to remove analytics tags); however be aware that this may interfere with our ability to track errors and performance issues that affect your account.
We encrypt backups, don’t store credit card numbers on our servers and generally make sure your data is safe.
When legally required, or when we suspect fraud, we may share data with law enforcement.
If you have questions, or want to export or delete your data, please write to support@nokotime.com.
Privacy Policy
By using NokoTime.com (the “Website”) and/or a Noko account (the “Service”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. The Service is designed and operated by Slash7 LLC (“Slash7”). Please read the Terms of Service in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.
GDPR compliance and Privacy Shield
For a detailed list of data sub-processors under the GDPR please see below under “Sharing of Data”.
If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:
You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. You can exercise these rights by emailing support@letsfreckle.com.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing support@letsfreckle.com.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
Right to Access, Correct, Update, or Request Deletion of Data
If you want to request an export or deletion of your personal data, and have an account with us, please contact us at support@ nokotime.com. Please note that we cannot delete personal data in open accounts when you’re not the account owner, as this would prevent us from providing the service the account owner is paying for (We suggest that you contact the account owner of the Noko account in question to ask them to anonymize or remove your data).
In order to accommodate customers who need older data restored, we keep backups indefinitely and cannot delete personal data form them as these are stored off-site, read-only and heavily encrypted and compressed. If we do have access or restore data to our production systems or for purposes of debugging, any deletions of personal data will be applied retroactively or the personal data will be anonymized.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
International data transfers
GDPR includes provisions on international data transfer mechanisms. In order to comply with these provisions we have certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (please see below for details).
Data Retention and Deletion Schedules
Application Data and Backups
Backups are securely encrypted and stored as defined in our Privacy Policy.
In order to accommodate customers who need older data restored, we keep backups indefinitely and cannot delete personal data form them as these are stored off-site, read-only and heavily encrypted and compressed. If we do have access or restore data to our production systems or for purposes of debugging, any deletions of personal data will be applied retroactively or the personal data will be anonymized.
Purchase Records and Invoices for our Services and Products
We keep copies of all purchasing records for tax and auditing purposes.
Personal Metadata
We keep personal metadata, given that the user allows us to process their data, which can be controlled by going to the Privacy tab in Settings & Profile.
When a user opts-out of a type of data processing we prevent additional data from being sent to the relevant data controllers. Every quarter, we contact our data processors with a list of users who have opted out of allowing us to process their personal data in the specific manner that we use their tools.
We will also respond to Data Subject Rights Requests within the appropriate amount of time
Metadata collected by 3rd-party services
Some 3rd party services collect data independently from us, and have incorporated it as part of their service.
We do not store any copies of this data, and Data Subject Requests for this data must be submitted to the 3rd party service, since we do not control the data.
Slash 7’s Internal Business Data
We keep all internal business data as long as it’s relevant, and internal business data may include the data listed above.
Data Processing Agreement
We do have a Standard Data Processing Addendum (DPA), which meets with GDPR requirements for agreements between Data Controllers (you) and Data Processors (us). We offer this DPA to our customers that operate in the EU. The DPA offers contractual terms that meet GDPR requirements and reflect our data privacy and security commitments to our clients. To ensure no inconsistent or additional terms are imposed on us beyond that reflected in our standard DPA and model clauses, we cannot agree to sign customers’ DPAs. We’re a small team so we can’t offer individual changes to the DPA since we do not have a legal team on staff. Any changes to the standard DPA would require legal counsel that would be cost prohibitive, increase our prices and would put an undue burden on our other customers. The DPA is a part of our Terms of Service. By agreeing to our terms of service, you are automatically accepting our DPA and do not need to sign a separate document.
EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
Slash7 LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Slash7 LLC has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Slash7 is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Slash7 complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Slash7 is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Slash7 may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Slash7 LLC commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Slash7 LLC at:
Thomas Fuchs, Owner, thomas@slash7.com.
Slash7 LLC has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, you may visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint (free of charge). To facilitate fast and convenient resolution of complaints, you agree to participate in on-line dispute resolution through JAMS Online Mediation (Endispute).
Under certain conditions, Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have not provided resolution. This is described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield.
