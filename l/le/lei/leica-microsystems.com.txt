Effective, April 26th 2018
This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how we handle the Personal Data provided to us on websites, mobile sites, mobile applications, and other digital services and products controlled by Leica Microsystems GmbH (collectively, "Leica Microsystems Sites"). Leica Microsystems is the data controller for the processing of Personal Data under applicable law.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Leica Microsystems Sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy or to third-party Web sites to which Leica Microsystems Sites may link.
Types of Information We Collect Online
The types of Personal Data that we may collect while you use the Leica Microsystems Sites are described in this section and include both information that you provide to us and information that we collect automatically when you use the Leica Microsystems Sites.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Data" means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Data include name, address, telephone number, and email address.
Information You Provide
You do not have to register for a service or program to receive much of the information available through Leica Microsystems Sites. However, some of our content may be available only to registered or identified users and will require you to set up a profile or provide specific information about yourself in order to provide you the service.
Personal Data You Provide When Visiting Leica Microsystems Sites
Leica Microsystems collects Personal Data that you provide on Leica Microsystems Sites, for example, when purchasing a product, to receive marketing products and information, contact Leica Microsystems customer service, or respond to Leica Microsystems questionnaires or surveys. This could include:
Contact Information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address

If you communicate with or request information from Leica Microsystems, you may be prompted to provide your contact information as well as any Personal Data that is relevant to your request.
Information That May Be Collected Automatically
When you use the Leica Microsystems Sites, we also may collect certain usage and device information automatically as described below.
IP Address
We may record the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer or other electronic device when you visit the Leica Microsystems Sites. An IP address identifies the electronic device you use to access the Sites, which allows us to maintain communication with your computer as you move about Leica Microsystems Sites and to customize content.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We also collect information about your use of Leica Microsystems Sites through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A "cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A "Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site, e-mail or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you on the basis of "clickstream” data that shows your previous activities on Leica Microsystems Sites.
We utilize Google Display Advertising (such as Retargeting with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) to (1) show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to Leica Microsystems Sites, and (2) better understand our ad impressions and use of ad services. In connection with the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting service, we may use data from Google's interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to understand and improve our marketing campaigns and Site content.
Some of our online advertising takes place through Google Display Advertising. As part of this program, we use Google Analytics features such as Retargeting. In connection with that feature and others offered by ad networks, we and the operators of ad networks, including Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize and serve ads across the Internet, based on a user's past visits to Leica Microsystems Sites. We also may show you ads from some of our affiliated companies when you visit Leica Microsystems Sites.
You can opt out of Google Ads by visiting http://www.google.com/ads/preferences. If you do not want your data used by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at the Google Analytics opt-out page.
This Leica Microsystems Site is not designed to respond to "do not track" signals received from browsers.

Legal Basis for Processing
Under European data protection laws, Leica Microsystems must have a legal basis to process your Personal Data. The legal basis that applies in a particular instance will depend on the specific purpose, as described above, for which Leica Microsystems is processing your Personal Data:
In certain cases, Leica Microsystems may ask for your consent to collect and process your Personal Data. Should you choose to provide your consent, you may later withdraw your consent by contacting us as described in the "Your Privacy Choices” section. Please note that the withdrawal of consent will not affect processing which has already occurred.
In other instances, the processing of your Personal Data may be necessary in order to comply with an applicable law or regulation or for the performance of a contract to which you are subject. You may not be able to opt-out of this processing, or your choice to opt-out may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation otherwise owed to you.
In still other instances, Leica Microsystems may process your Personal Data based on Leica Microsystems’s legitimate interests in communicating with you about our products and services, and about scientific research and educational opportunities. You have the right to opt-out of all such processing of your Personal Data. You may do so by contacting us as described in the "Your Privacy Choices” section.
Information We Share
We only share your Personal Data with third parties as described below. We do not sell or rent Personal Data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Third-Party Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising
You may be provided with online advertisements of Leica Microsystems products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that you provide to Leica Microsystems or a third-party website you are visiting, or of your browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:
We may share with our advertising service providers your non-identifying information that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies on our Leica Microsystems Sites.
Some Leica Microsystems Sites participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called re-target advertising or interest-based advertising). You can identify these sites by the "Advertising Choices” link in the footer. Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on Leica Microsystems Web sites and on other third-party Web sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests. When a Leica Microsystems online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an "Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from Leica Microsystems that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. You can also opt out now by clicking here.
Some Web browsers may transmit "do-not-track” signals to Web sites with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, Leica Microsystems does not currently respond to these signals. As discussed above, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements by visitingg adchoices.

We have relationships with suppliers and affiliated companies, who help us operate our business and for whom it may be necessary to have access to your Personal Data in the course of providing services to Leica Microsystems.

Data Security
Leica Microsystems maintains reasonable technical, administrative and physical controls to secure any Personal Data collected through the Leica Microsystems Sites.

Third Party Sites and Social Media Plug-ins
This Privacy Policy does not apply to Leica Microsystems Sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy, or to third-party Web sites to which Leica Microsystems Sites may link. Leica Microsystems Sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook "Like” button, "Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit Leica Microsystems Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our Leica Microsystems Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our Leica Microsystems Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our Leica Microsystems Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.

Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than Germany, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for Personal Data is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Policy in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you understand that your Personal Data will be stored and processed in Germany and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.
