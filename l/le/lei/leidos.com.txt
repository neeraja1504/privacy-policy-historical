Privacy Statement | Leidos
Back to top
Last Updated: May 2019
Leidos, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Leidos,” “we” or us”) recognizes the importance of protecting the personal information of any visitor to  leidos.com , sites that operate on a related sub-domain, or sites identified as being owned and operated by Leidos (“Leidos websites”). This Privacy Statement (or “Statement”) applies only to Leidos’ online activities and is valid for visitors to Leidos websites with regards to the information that is shared and/or collected. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website. We commit to processing your Personal Information responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection/privacy laws in the countries where we operate.
This Statement applies to all users of our Leidos websites. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have additional rights, which are explained in the Application of Local Laws and Managing Your Personal Information sections.
For purposes of this Statement, “you” refers to any visitor to a Leidos website.
Some Leidos websites may have a separate or supplemental privacy Statement, policy or notice, which you should review as well. For example, the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy can be found here (in the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy, the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy takes precedence).
If there is a conflict between this Statement and the terms of any agreement between a Leidos customer and Leidos, the terms of such agreement will control.
Current Privacy STATEMENT Changes since PRIOR Privacy STATEMENT
Accepting this Statement
You acknowledge that you have read this Statement and that you understand and accept it.
Your use of our Leidos websites and any dispute related to the collection of your Personal Information is subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Terms of Service (including any applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes) and any applicable End User License Agreement.
Application of Local Laws
This Privacy Statement is designed to comply with relevant applicable laws in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Australia. If an applicable local data protection or privacy law provides for a lesser level of protection than that established by this Statement, then this Statement shall prevail.
Consent to Data Transfer
While Leidos has active businesses in many countries around the globe, we are headquartered in the United States. Thus, if you proceed to use this site, your Personal Information may be transferred to or accessible by entities or individuals in the United States and processed according to the terms described in this Privacy Statement.
Personal Information collected by Leidos may be stored and processed in the United States and/or in any other country where Leidos or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities. Typically, the primary storage location is in the United States or a customer’s region (which may also be the United States), often with a backup to a data center in a different region. Storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, improve performance, and create redundancies to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.
We (or our service providers) may transfer Personal Information from the EEA to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, those countries’ laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a government authority capable of addressing your concerns. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts and written assurances from service providers, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your Personal Information. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the personal data protection in the countries where Leidos operates (such as the United States), please visit:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
By continuing to use this site, you authorize Leidos and its service providers to transfer your Personal Information to – or make it available in – destinations outside your home country and to process it according to this Privacy Statement. You may contact us at  [email  protected] ** ** for more information about the safeguards used to protect your Personal Information if it is transferred outside of your country of residence.
What Types of Personal Information Are Collected via Leidos Websites?
For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, “Personal Information” generally means data, or a combination of data from one or more sources, that identifies or could reasonably be used to identify an individual.
When you visit a Leidos website, the Personal Information collected about you may include, but is not limited to:
name;
postal address;
e-mail address;
organization name and job title;
telephone number;
IP address;
network and geo-location; and
education and/or employment history.
If you cannot or choose not to provide us with this Personal Information, we may be unable to provide you with the information or services you have requested.
Why is this Personal Information Collected?
We generally collect the Personal Information described above on an entirely voluntary basis – in other words, we do not require you to give us your Personal Information. Certain areas of Leidos websites, however, may request your Personal Information so that you can use specific features, learn more about Leidos or access certain content. For example, you may be asked to submit Personal Information if you:
request a product demo, download or access information about our products, services or programs;
watch on-demand content;
submit a contact form to request customer or technical support;
access Investor Relations information;
apply for a job with Leidos; or
ask to have a Leidos employee contact you.
Non-Personal Information, Analytics, and Advertising
We market our business in a number of ways, primarily through digital advertising, owned social media presences, email marketing campaigns and other offline mechanisms. To understand how our marketing or promotional campaigns are performing, one or more of our third-party service providers may collect certain information via our Leidos websites. We and these service providers use several industry standard analytics and tracking tools to collect this information, such as web browsers and flash cookies, web beacons and other, similar technologies. The information we collect includes IP addresses, number of page visits, pages viewed, search engine referrals, browsing activities over time and across other websites following your visit to one or more of our Leidos websites, and responses to offline marketing campaigns through dedicated tracking web addresses.
Note : Although network or device identifiers such as computer or device IP addresses, serial numbers or other identification numbers do not necessarily identify an individual who uses such computers or devices, some jurisdictions’ laws may define them as Personal Information.
We use Non-Personal Information to:
identify new visitors to Leidos websites;
recognize returning visitors;
analyze the effectiveness of our website content and marketing or sales-related activities;
better understand our audience, customers, or other website visitors; and
determine whether website visitors, potential customers and customers might be interested in additional content, new products or services.

Managing Your Personal Information
Certain data protection/privacy laws may provide you rights with respect to how we manage your Personal Information. These rights (and potential limitations on them) are described below.
Right to Change or Delete Your Personal Information
You have a right to request that we correct or delete inaccurate Personal Information about you.  In such cases, we will first verify your identity and then check whether the Personal Information is in fact inaccurate. We will correct any Personal Information found to be incorrect.
You can also request that we delete your Personal Information if, for example,
it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was initially based on consent), and where there is no other  legal basis  for the processing;
we are relying on our legitimate interests as the basis for processing your Personal Information, you object to such processing, and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue processing it;
we are processing it for direct marketing purposes and you object to that processing; or
it has been processed unlawfully.
Please note that this right to deletion is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances. For example, we are not required to comply with your request if it is necessary for us to maintain your Personal Information:
for compliance with a legal obligation;
for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
for the performance of a contract;
to detect, prevent, or otherwise mitigate  illegal activities, including but not limited to fraud, computer crimes and identity theft;
to avoid or mitigate harm to Leidos personnel or property or to others,
it is in our legitimate interests and there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests in having your Personal Information deleted; and
to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including employment laws and regulations.
Right to Restrict the Processing of Your Personal Information
You can ask us to limit processing of your Personal Information, but only when:
you dispute its accuracy, to allow us to verify its accuracy;
the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased;
it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.
After you submit a request to restrict the processing of your Personal Information, we can continue to process it:
when we have your consent;
to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
Right to Transfer your Personal Information
You can ask us to provide your Personal Information  to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another entity or company, but only when:
the processing of your Personal Information is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you;
the processing is carried out by automated means; and
where such transfer or production is technically feasible.
Right to Object to the Processing of your Personal Information
You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information if our processing is for direct marketing purposes.
You can also object if the processing is for:
a task carried out in the public interest;
the exercise of official authority vested in us; or
our legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
In these circumstances the right to object is not absolute. You must provide specific reasons why you are objecting to the processing of your Personal Information. These reasons should be based upon your particular situation. And please note that we may still continue processing if:
we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms; or
the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
If we are processing your Personal Information for scientific or historical research, or for statistical purposes, your right to object might also be limited.

Right to Not be Subject to Automated Decision-Making
You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.
Data Retention
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as required for the purposes for which it was collected. How long we retain it depends on a number of factors, including the  legal basis  for which it was obtained and/or additional legal or regulatory obligations. Thus, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements. We may also store it for longer periods of time to have an accurate record of your interactions with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.
