Our Legal Basis for Data Processing
In some circumstances, we are not allowed to process personal data if we do not have a valid legal ground. Therefore, we will only process your personal data in these specific situations if:
the processing is necessary to perform our contractual obligations towards you or to take pre-contractual steps at your request, such as when we authenticate your log-in to our services or ensure that you only have access to the services and data you’ve agreed to buy;
the processing is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, such as tax reporting or regulatory requirements;
the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of LegitScript, and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (see below);

If we ever process any special categories of data relating to you, we will do so because:
the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim;

Accessing and Correcting Data
In some circumstances, you may have the right to access personal data that we hold and ask that we correct, amend, or delete information which is inaccurate or has not been processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the privacy rights of third parties would be violated.

We may also ask you to provide information that helps us better understand what you are asking. To exercise your rights, send an email to privacy@legitscript.com.

Therefore, data access requests should include the name of the LegitScript customer who submitted your personal data to LegitScript. We will forward such requests to the customer you identify to respond directly to you and will provide any necessary assistance in that customer’s response to you.
