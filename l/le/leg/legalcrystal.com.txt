Privacy Policy - LegalCrystal
Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to the LegalCrystal Privacy Promise for Subscribers, which is as follows:
While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our subscribers' trust. Keeping subscriber information secure, and using it only as our subscribers would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at LegalCrystal. Here then, is our promise to our individual subscribers:
·We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our subscribers share with us.
·We will limit the collection and use of subscriber information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our subscribers, which includes advising our subscribers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.
·We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of subscriber information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal disciplinary process.
·We will not reveal subscriber information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the subscriber in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the subscriber, or are required by law.
·We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our subscriber information.
·Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.
·We will attempt to keep subscriber files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our subscribers how and where to conveniently access their information (except when we're prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
