Privacy & Legal
How we protect your privacy
Lenox is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and/or to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We also may monitor customer activity and site usage to help us best serve our visitors. In addition, in order to keep our customers informed about Lenox product news, special offers, and other products or services of interest, we may send such information via postal mail, email or telephone, based on customer-provided contact information. For information on how we protect your privacy and credit card information when you order our products online, click here.
We always try to offer all visitors the best site possible. Lenox.com may use, for example, a Session ID Cookie, which allows the site's features to run smoothly and to provide enhanced online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt-out of this advertising provided directly by us, click here. Many sites track usage on their sites, which is part of basic web technology and the only real way an e-tailer, like Lenox, can tell if its customers like or dislike a feature and we may share this information with carefully selected partners whose products and services you may find of interest.
While you are at Lenox.com, you will see forms that allow you to leave your name and contact information. By using Lenox.com, you consent to the collection and use of the information obtained by Lenox and to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Website. If we decide to change the Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are aware of our online practices, including how we use the information we collect and under what circumstances we disclose it. Lenox is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of the non-Lenox websites to which Lenox.com may link.
Unless you leave your name and contact information on any of our registration forms, you can browse and exit the Website without leaving any information that would identify you. If you choose to do so, we may contact you via email, postal mail or telephone informing you of new products, services or events. Occasionally we will rent our postal mailing lists to companies that have products or services that we believe will be of interest to our customers. Even if we share our mailing lists with these other companies, however, please be assured we do not share your email address or credit card information. For details on how to "opt-out" if you do not want us to contact you or rent your postal address information, see Section D below entitled, “How to be removed from our lists.”
At some point Lenox may sell or transfer subsidiaries, divisions or business units. If any such transactions occur, customer information relating to the transferred unit would likely be one of the transferred business assets. Also, if Lenox or substantially all of its assets were acquired by another entity, customer information would be one of the assets transferred. However, any information transferred in these situations would remain subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of collection of the information (unless the customer consents otherwise).
Except as otherwise provided in this Policy or by law, personally identifiable information is only shared with Lenox. From time to time, we engage third parties to provide services related to the maintenance and operation of the Website and to provide personalized online display advertising. In connection with these types of services, the provider may have access to information provided by users of the Website. A service provider's use of such information is typically restricted by confidentiality agreements with Lenox, and such information may in some instances be made anonymous before reaching the service provider.
Our Website is designed for potential customers who are 18 years of age or older. We do not intentionally collect information from children.
