Collection of Personal Information
Keeping your information private and secure is incredibly important to us. These pages explain what we collect and why we collect it.
Please note: we only collect what we need and we only share when it’s necessary to help you out.
Personal info we collect|  Why we collect it?
---|---
Your name, address, and date of birth| We need this in order to determine the appropriate insurance price based on a risk assessment of your property, your claims history, credit rating, and other attributes. The credit check has no impact on your credit score.
Your email address| This is part of the account creation process. It’s also the way that we will contact you with policy, service, claims, availability in your region, and news-related communications.
Your home inventory| The more we know about your home and what’s in it, the better and faster we’re able to respond when you have a problem.
Your payment information| This is needed to process your payment. Since we use a third-party payment processor, we have only limited information about your payment transactions.
Facebook or other social account| This may be your preferred method for account creation. You may also use social connection as a way to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.
Contact/Address book| You may use your contact list to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.
App and device usage statistics| We may collect data from your smartphone. We aggregate and anonymize this data to look for statistical patterns that can help us give you, and all our users, more precise rates and coverage, as well as to improve overall performance and experience.
The type of incident, date, and time| We need this in order to create a record of your claim and to assess how to best respond.
Your phone number| We need this in order to contact you. We may share your phone number with our service providers who need to coordinate with you.
A short video| This helps us better understand what happened. The video is always kept private.
