Security
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using a 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. This SSL is the strongest encryption available.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Levenger.com uses HACKER SAFE to ensure your personal information cannot be read by hackers.
Please note: while it's safe to order online through our Website, we do not recommend that you send a credit card order through an email.

1. Information Collected
a) Personally Identifiable Information
If you request a catalog or join our e-list a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, address and email address). We use this information to send the customer a catalog and/or marketing emails. It is optional for the user to provide unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience. We rent our customer’s mailing address with other third party catalog companies. If you wish to remove your name from third party rentals, it can be done by emailing our Customer Support at cservice@levenger.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you submit a comment for Add Your Review, we collect your name, email, and city/state to use as part of the testimonial for the product. We do not use your email address for marketing purposes but we may use it to contact you directly regarding your feedback. As stated on the Add Your Review page, by submitting your information and comments, you authorize us to print your name and comments as a review for the product listed. When an order is placed with us, you may be asked to provide your name, address or credit card information in connection with your use of the Website (including without limitation, by your submission of purchase orders.) This information is used for billing purposes, to fill customer orders and to send the customer a catalog.

We do track and analyze personally identifiable usage for customers who have completed a purchase, requested a catalog or signed up for our e-list. The provider uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and Levenger sets cookies that will be listed under the domain lev.levenger.com.

We also partner with other third parties such as Experian to provide specific services. For example, Experian is responsible for the data processing and postal sortation for each catalog mailing. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names and mailing address information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
