3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

The type of information that gets collected depends on the section of our site that the user accesses. A large portion of our website can be accessed by the general public without a need to share any kind of personal information. In those areas of the site, the information collected may include IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, session length, etc. This information, of anonymous nature, allows Leviton to measure the performance of its website, and come up with possible improvements for it. Leviton may use this type information, which does not reveal the user identity, in whatever fashion it deems necessary.
Visitors to our website can register to create an account, access the website, and download Software. When you register for an account, we will request some personal information such as your name, address, e-mail, telephone number or fax number, location, and other relevant information. Leviton will not resell, or share this information with any outside entity unless that’s required in order for us to comply with a law, or a court order, or to protect our vital business interests.
When you purchase products from the Leviton website, your complete purchase order is processed by Leviton, but your payment information is submitted directly by you to a third party website for processing of your payment only. Leviton does not collect, store, or see your credit card information.
Leviton is committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access by having various administrative and technology safeguards in place. Any page at our site that asks you for sensitive information is highly secure. Most browsers will show a lock icon in the bottom status bar on secure pages. Look for this icon on any web page that asks for sensitive information.
Any other communication you transmit to the website, such as questions, comments, suggestions, or the like, will not be encrypted or otherwise secured or treated confidentially.

Use of Cookies
Leviton may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to identify that specific user the next time he or she visits the website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information, as well as providing personalized functionality.
We do not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as integrating another site that relies on third-party cookies into the existing website).
Modifying cookie settings
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. The help function of your browser should contain instructions to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your computer to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Website features (i.e. you will be able to browse the site, but will not be able to make a purchase).
Use of Web Beacons or GIF Files
This website may contain electronic images known as “Web Beacons” (also called single-pixel gifs) that allow Leviton to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Leviton may include Web Beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Leviton prohibits Web Beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
