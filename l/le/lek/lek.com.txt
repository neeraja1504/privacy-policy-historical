In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. For the processing of data subject to GDPR, they will only process your personal data on our instructions and where they are subject to a duty of confidentiality, and we will also deal with personal data breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

9. Data retention
L.E.K. Consulting will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including, where applicable, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods applied to your personal data can be requested by contacting us. For data subjects protected by GDPR we keep basic information about you for six years after you cease to use our services or hold other communication with us. This data retention schedule comes into effect January 2020, six years since the launch of our current contact database. Personal information collected in relation to money laundry requirements will be kept for up to 10 years. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data: see request erasure below for further information.
We may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Consulting staff will also have access to that information and may use such information to contact you.  If you are a data subject protected by GDPR, L.E.K.

12. Your legal rights
Under local data protection laws, you may have rights in relation to your personal data. In the processing of your personal data, certain of your rights are protected by the GDPR, and these rights will include the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent
If you are protected by GDPR and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. However, there are circumstances in which those rights may not be available to you and we may not satisfy your request.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights, where these rights apply in our processing of your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
In addition, where granted by local law, you may also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the relevant data protection authority. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach any authority so please contact us in the first instance.
13. Your California privacy rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send an e-mail to info@lek.com or write us at:
