Lexus Financial Services, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, Toyota Motor Insurance Services, Inc., and their subsidiaries (LFS, or we) respect your privacy and the confidential nature of the information that we gather during the course of our relationship with you. This Policy describes Lexus Financial Services' policy regarding information received about you during visits to our website.
Normal Website Usage
You can visit Lexus Financial Services' website to read product, investment, and company information, or use some of our online tools (e.g., What's Right for Me? and Payment Estimator) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. During these types of visits, we collect and store statistical information on an anonymous basis, such as the information about the time and length of your visit, the website you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We may also collect and store the name of your Internet Service Provider.
We use cookies when you enter our website to help us gather this type of statistical information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes so that we can track website and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do so, some parts of our website may not work properly for you.
We also use cookies to trigger certain online customer service surveys, which could be hosted on a site other than this site. These surveys are completely anonymous and optional. The information that LFS and any outside survey company obtain from you if you choose to fill out these surveys is used only to improve your experience in visiting the LFS website.
Collection and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
There are instances where we request personally identifiable information to provide our website visitors a service or correspondence (e.g., promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, or type of request, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and used to fulfill your request. If you are our customer, the information may also be shared as described below.
When you submit an online application to us or you are accessing your account online, we collect the following types of personally identifiable information about you:

Information we receive from you about your transactions with us, or affiliates (as permitted by law), or others such as account balances, payment history or account activity.
Credit applications and consumer report information: We do not disclose personally identifiable information from your credit application to any third parties, including our affiliates, except as permitted by law. We also collect information from consumer reporting agencies, but we do not disclose personally identifiable consumer report information to any third parties, including our affiliates, except as permitted by law.
If you are our customer, to the extent permitted by law and in accordance with our Privacy Policy, the personally identifiable information we collect about you may be shared with our affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties as follows:
