(a)            ** Service Providers.   **We use third parties to help us operate and improve the Service (e.g., hosting providers, e-commerce service providers and analytics service providers). We may provide these third parties information we collect and they may collect information from you and about your use of the Service.

(c)            ** Legal Requirements**. In some cases, we or our service providers may disclose your personal information as required by law; to enforce this Policy or any other agreement between you and LKQ; if we or our service providers believe that disclosure is needed to protect the Service, any Host or Guest, or our rights; prevent or stop fraud or any other activity that, in our sole discretion, may cause harm to person or property or be illegal, unethical, or legally actionable; to government regulators; to law enforcement authorities; in connection with any complaint, dispute, claim, conflict, judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us or the Service; and to respond to a physical threat to you or another person.
(d)           ** Insolvency and Business Transitions**. If we ever file for bankruptcy or engage in a business transition such as a merger or joint venture with another company, or if we purchase, sell, or reorganize all or a part of the Service or our business or assets or the business or assets of our affiliates, we may disclose your personal information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Service. No storage or transmission of data can be 100% secure.
4.     ** ONLINE TRACKING AND YOUR CHOICES  **
4.1.          As discussed above, because we and our third party service providers automatically collect Service usage information through the use of Cookies (including as described in Section 1.2,  Information that is  _ _Automatically Collected , and Section 3.3,  Sharing with Third Parties ), your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of automatically collected information. One way to attempt to “opt out” of the collection of any information through Cookies and some (but not all) other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable Cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult and may not be possible. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.  Additionally, if you select a “Do Not Track” option or disable Cookies on your device, certain Service may become unavailable or may not function properly.
4.2.          You may adjust certain aspects of Apps, such as turning on and off notifications, by adjusting your preferences within the “Settings”.
5.     ** INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES**
Keeping secure personal information that we collect is of great concern to us. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no storage or transmission of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. When you provide information to the Service, you do so at your own risk and fully understand and agree to accept the risks of unauthorized access, use and disclosure of your personal information that may occur despite our compliance with this Policy and implementation of security technologies.
We will keep your personal information in a file specific to you, and store your personal information at the offices and data centers of us and our service providers in the United States.  As we are a U.S. business, we use and store your personal information in the United States. If you do not reside in the United States, you should note that any personal information we collect is subject to United States’ laws, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of the United States, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  For written information about our policies and practices regarding foreign service providers, contact our Privacy Officer (see Section 10 below).

7.     ** CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT LAW**

Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
8.     ** ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
If you would like to update your personal information associated with your Account, you may make changes in the “My Profile” or “Settings” portions of the Service.  Aside from updates you make, at any time, you may challenge the accuracy or completeness of your personal information in our records.

Where appropriate, we will transmit the updated information to third parties having access to your personal information.
