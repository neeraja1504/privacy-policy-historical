Personally identifiable information
Only information you provide LTheme with directly will be collected, such as through subscribing to various products & services, or identifying yourself when requesting information to be sent to you. For example, when you fill out a request form, we collect the details you enter in order to post information to you. When you answer questions about what you would like to see we keep this information so as to better serve you.
Emails
From time to time with your permission LTheme will send you relevant information emails regarding products and services which you have previously registered your interest in.

Cookies
LTheme uses “cookies” to help enhance your experience on the site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies as the default. Cookies themselves do not contain personal information about you. They simply operate as a unique identifier which helps JoomlaShine to know what customers find interesting and useful on the website, almost like a continuing questionnaire. JoomlaShine does not store any personal information inside cookies, although the cookie may identify the user’s browser.
The use of cookies can enhance your experience on the LTheme site, by remembering information that you have previously given. They can make it easier for you to fill out forms, shop online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests.
