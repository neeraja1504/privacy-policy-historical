The server host’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to LRNGO and to provide the necessary level of protection for the data stored.

LRNGO does not provide user personal information to third parties without prior consent of the user. However, LRNGO provides personal information only when the user directly agrees to providing personal information in order to use products or services of the external affiliate, and when the user is obliged to submit personal information in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. Personal information we gather is for internal use only and LRNGO will not authorize the release of this information to anyone outside LRNGO (except to third party service providers to who perform functions on our behalf but in such event personal information will only be shared to the extent reasonably necessary to perform their functions and they will not be authorized to use it for any other function), unless you have consented to such disclosure.
If you breach our website terms of use, or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, such as a lawful request from public authorities in regard to law enforcement or national security requirements, we may disclose your information to a relevant authority. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and security or credit risk. In other words, we may release the information we collect to third parties when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, to protect the rights and safety of others, or to assist with industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct.
We may release the information we collect to a third party if the information is provided to enable the third party to provide services to us, provided that the third party has agreed to use at least the same level of privacy protections described in this Privacy Policy, and is permitted to use the information only for the purpose of providing services to us.

LRNGO is committed to commercially reasonable safeguards, best practices, and approaches to keep your information secure and prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our possession.

We store information you provide to us on a computer system located in a controlled facility with limited access and our company databases are accessible only by LRNGO. However, while we make reasonable efforts to prevent third party, non-affiliate access to personally identifiable information, all data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure, and information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used, illegally or otherwise, by those other than the intended recipients. Therefore, despite these safeguards, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to our Website, or guarantee that information on our website will not be improperly accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. In view of the foregoing, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to or accessed by parties other than those authorized under this Privacy Policy.
We use reasonable measures to safeguard the security and integrity of your personal information through procedures and technology designed for that purpose. You should always safeguard your own personal information by protecting any passwords or other identifying information used to access your account with us and by safely disposing of any personal information that is no longer needed.
Verification
LRNGO, INC. utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with its Privacy Policy. LRNGO regularly verifies that the Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, and prominently displayed, and conducts its self-assessment periodically to ensure that all relevant privacy practices are being followed. Internal procedures for periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance are in place.
Communication
Individuals are informed that their personal information is:
used only for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy and only if the individual has provided implicit or explicit consent, unless a law or regulation specifically requires otherwise,
retained for no longer than necessary to fulfill the stated purposes, or for a period specifically required by law or regulation, and
disposed of in a manner reasonably intended to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.
