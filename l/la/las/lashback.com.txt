LashBack® | Privacy Policy
Last Modified: May 18, 2017
Thank you for your interest in LASHBACK®, LLC (“LASHBACK®”) and our website located at www.lashback.com. We are pleased to provide this privacy policy to inform you of our practices with respect to how we collect and use personally identifiable information about visitors to our website. By using this website, you consent to the following terms.
What we collect
The only personally identifiable information that we require about you is your contact information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, e-mail) and unique identifier (e.g., password). If you purchase any of our products or services, we will also collect financial information (e.g., credit card number). We also collect IP addresses, but this information generally does not reveal your identity.
How we collect it
We collect your personally identifiable information when you use the website, complete the registration form, or purchase any of the products or services offered on our website.
Cookies
To facilitate your use of our website, we may use “cookies.” A cookie is small amount of data that our servers transfer to your browser and that only our servers can read. When you log onto this website, the cookie file captures your username, unique session identifier number and other session data to enable you to traverse through this website’s various screens without having to authenticate yourself at each new screen.
Use of Information
We use your personally identifiable information to: (1) verify your authority to access this website, (2) provide you with access to any services that you may chose to subscribe to, (3) process and ship any products that you purchase through our website, and (4) contact you when reasonably necessary. We may also use any information you have entered into the website as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the website and our products and services.
Non-Disclosure
LASHBACK® will not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor will LASHBACK® provide to third parties your Personal Information unless LASHBACK® has your consent (which LASHBACK® may infer has been granted based on circumstances of use of Lashback.com and specific product requests) and (1) sharing your Personal Information is required to provide the product or service you have requested, or (2) LASHBACK® needs to send your Personal Information to companies which work on its behalf in order to provide you a product or service (which companies will not have any right to use your Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist LASHBACK®). LASHBACK® will disclose your Personal Information to the extent required in the event it must respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, or if LASHBACK® finds that your actions on LashBack.com violate any terms of use, any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or any terms of any license agreements you agree to.
Links
For your convenience, we may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals to certain third parties’ products or services. If you choose to visit a third party’s website or use its products or services, please be aware that the third party’s privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party.
Security
We employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with the demands of customer service, reasonably designed to protect your personally identifiable information from loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Where reasonably practical, we use encryption, password protection and other security technology (e.g. Secure Socket Layer) to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.
Do Not Track
LASHBACK® respects enhanced user privacy controls. We support the development and implementation of a standard “do not track” browser feature, which provides customers with control over the collection and use of information by third parties regarding their web-browsing activities. At this time LASHBACK® does not respond to DNT mechanisms. Once a standardized “do not track” feature is released, LASHBACK® intends to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the COPPA Rule which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
LASHBACK® does not direct its websites to children. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use any LASHBACK® SERVICES. LASHBACK® does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we obtain evidence that a user is under the age of 13, we will take every reasonable step to remove any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) permanently from our Internet servers.
Policy Changes
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and will post any revisions on its website located at  www.lashback.com. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this web site will be subject to the then-current privacy policy.
