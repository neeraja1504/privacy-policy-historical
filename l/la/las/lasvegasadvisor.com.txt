Download an evalaution: We ask for your e-mail address before downloading a free product evaluation. If at anytime you decide that you do not want to receive further marketing messages from us, each e-mail will include a link to our unsubscribe page. Your contact information may be forwarded to an authorized Huntington Press reseller in your area, in which case you may need to follow-up with them. Unsubscribing will not interrupt any ongoing conversations you may be having with Huntington Press.

You may unsubscribe or change your format preference from the discussion lists page.
If you are using the same e-mail address for multiple items above, the e-mail usage information for 'downloading an evaluation' takes precedent over all other e-mail usage information.
You may also remove yourself from our marketing list by sending an e-mail to cs@huntingtonpress.com from the e-mail address you would like to unsubscribe from.
If you opt out or unsubscribe, we may, in compliance with the United States CAN SPAM Act of 2003, run our suppression list (addresses not to be emailed) against another list of names for an Huntington Press mailing or provide our suppression list to a third party for such verification.
