Privacy Policy | Laserfiche
NOTICE: This Privacy Policy is effective as of September 1, 2018.
Welcome to the Laserfiche.com website (the “Site”). This Site is operated by Compulink Management Center, Inc. doing business as Laserfiche and its affiliates (“Laserfiche”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how information is collected and used by Laserfiche. We refer to all products and services offered by Laserfiche and the Site, including its content and functionality, as the “Services.” We are committed to taking appropriate steps to help protect the privacy of visitors to our Site or users of our Services.
By accessing or using the Site or our Services, you agree to be bound by this Policy and are accepting and consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and other handling of your information as described below. If you are entering into the terms of this Policy on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity (an “ Entity “), you are agreeing to this Policy for that Entity and representing to Laserfiche that you have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to this Policy, in which case the terms “ you” or related terms herein shall refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Policy, you must not accept these terms and may not use the Site or Service.
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Laserfiche may act as either a controller or a processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances.
Laserfiche, located at the address in the section entitled “Contact Us” below, is the controller with respect to information you provide through the Site.
Sometimes Laserfiche operates as a processor on behalf of a customer, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, Laserfiche provides cloud services to its customers and processes personal data on their behalf to provide those services. Please visit the applicable customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the customer as the controller, not to Laserfiche.

Some of the hyperlinks on our Site may lead to third-party websites that are not controlled by or affiliated with Laserfiche (“Third Party Services”). These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Laserfiche of the content on such third-party websites. If you use our Services, which include third-party integration(s), such Services are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of each applicable third-party entity. For example, Office Online is a Microsoft service and use of Office Online is subject to Microsoft’s terms of use and privacy policy. Laserfiche is not responsible for and does not endorse, guarantee or monitor the content, availability, viewpoints, products or services that are offered or expressed on such third-party websites and does not make any representations or warranties regarding the content or accuracy of any content on these third-party websites, including third-party privacy policies.

3. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
Do-Not-Track (DNT) is a preference that can be set in your browser to notify websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. Laserfiche does not respond to DNT signals at this time. As discussed in this Policy, we and third parties may track your visits to our Site to provide targeted advertising.
4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies And Choices Regarding the Same
We use Tracking Technologies to collect information, including the following:
Cookies. We may send cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. These cookies help us to improve our Services and your experience. These cookies allow our Site to recognize your device to save preferences and settings for you, such as your session information. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Log Files. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data.
Pixels. A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
Device Fingerprinting. Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.
App Technologies. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
Location-Identifying Technologies. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.
We use tools such as “Google Analytics” and others to track the usage of this Site. Google Analytics collects information, which may include, but is not limited to, what pages are visited on the Site or what browser is used to view the Site. We use the information provided by Google Analytics to improve our Site and services. You may view how Google uses data when you use our Site by visiting Google’s Terms of Service located at: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you by disabling cookies on your browser. You can opt-out of your data being used by Google Analytics through cookies by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Site, Services, and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Sites, Services, and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Site, Services, and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).
We serve ads on and through Third Party Services, such as Facebook. LinkedIn and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Site or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to the Third Party Service or incorporating a pixel from the Third Party Service on our Site, and the Third Party Service matching common factors between our data and their data. To opt-out of receiving Matched Ads, please contact the applicable Third Party Service. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such Facebook ads and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Service’s failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.
You can reset your device advertising Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. For information on how to do this on Apple devices, visit Apple.com. For information on how to do this on Android devices, visit Google.com. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app.
The location data collected through an app depends on your device settings and app permissions. You can exercise choice over the location data collected through our apps by (i) for GPS data, disabling location in your device settings or disabling location permissions to that app; (ii) for Bluetooth data, disabling Bluetooth and any Bluetooth scanning option in your device settings; or (iii) for WiFi data, disabling WiFi and any WiFi scanning option in your device settings. You can stop collection of all location data via an app by uninstalling the app.
Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the Site or Services in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. In addition, some of these third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please note that if you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving online behavioral advertising to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).
Please be aware that if you disable or remove Tracking Technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly.
5. Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms
Occasionally, portions of the Site may allow you to post information that other visitors to the Site will be able to access (i.e., a “bulletin board” or interactive “chat”).  If you choose to post information on a bulletin board or through a chat session, it becomes available to the public, and Laserfiche has no ability to control or limit its use.  Laserfiche and its affiliates have a right to utilize any information you post through the Site in connection with the operation of its business. Laserfiche encourages you not to post any information you consider private or sensitive on the Site.
