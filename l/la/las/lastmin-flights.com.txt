Whether or not you provide us with this kind information is always entirely under your control. In order to minimize the impact on your privacy, we will never knowingly collect more Personal Data than is strictly necessary to perform the activities described in this policy.

In addition to information that you voluntarily provide to us, we also collect certain Non-Personal Information directly from you as you use the Services, as well as indirectly where it is provided to us automatically by the third party application, social networking site (such as Facebook or Twitter) or other website (such as a promotion partner) that you connect to the Services from.

How do we keep your Information safe and secure?
We make the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information our highest priority and we limit access to it to our employees who need to come into contact with it in order to fulfill their role and enable the Services to be provided to you.
Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, the transmission of information via the internet can never be completely secure and we are therefore unable to guarantee the security of the information which you share with us at your own risk.
