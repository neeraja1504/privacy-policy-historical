ABOUT LASERSHIP PHOTO ON DELIVERY
LaserShip may take a photo on delivery when a package is left unattended. The photo will focus on the placement of the package and immediately disappears from the driver’s device. Capturing delivery photos is intended to help customers see that their package was safely delivered and where. If a photo on delivery is captured, it may show up when you track a package from lasership.com.
Accessing a delivery photo, to the extent this feature is or becomes available, requires signing in with your user name and password on the lasership.com website. We may use delivery photos to verify delivery location, audit for quality purposes, or troubleshoot what happened to a package.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
LaserShip does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other individuals or nonaffiliated companies, except to the extent necessary to provide the services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LaserShip's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We may transfer information about you if LaserShip is acquired by or merged with another company, including in the event of a reorganization, liquidation or dissolution. In this event, LaserShip will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
HOW WE STORE AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION
We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.
We will undertake reasonable steps to protect all information, from unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, misuse or processing, or from alteration, destruction, or loss. However, because no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of information you submit to us.
RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We may retain your questions and feedback in order to improve our services. Do not send us any information, ideas, suggestions, proposals or comments that you consider confidential or that you wish to be treated as confidential.

Your personal information will not be stored for longer than is necessary for which it was collected or as required under applicable retention policies or practices, or as otherwise may be permitted or required in accordance with applicable law.

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY)
Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of customers' personal information with third parties. These businesses are required to accept requests for disclosures of these policies from customers but are only required to honor one request per calendar year. Businesses have thirty (30) days to respond to each inquiry to the designated address. Each inquiring customer will receive an explanation of the categories of customer information shared and the names and addresses of any third party businesses. In limited circumstances, customers' failure to submit requests in the manner specified will not require a response from the business.
If you are a California resident, you may request such information from us by sending a letter to the address listed below. In your letter, please provide your name, address and email address, as well as a request that we provide such information to you, by using the following or similar language, “I request that LaserShip provide its third-party information sharing disclosures required by section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.”
