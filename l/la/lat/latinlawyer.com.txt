The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and processed by, a processor based in a destination outside of the European Economic Area (" EEA "). If this happens we will take steps, such as the inclusion of contractual clauses into our contracts with such processors, to ensure that your Personal Data is safe and treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy & Cookie Policy.
You can contact us at any time via the contact details in section 2 above for details of specific disclosures made in respect of your Personal Data.
