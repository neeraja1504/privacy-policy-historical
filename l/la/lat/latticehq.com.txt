Privacy
Degree, Inc., doing business as Lattice, and its affiliates (collectively, “Lattice”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Statement to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our website (the “Site”) and our online services, including the Lattice platform (the “Services”).
This Privacy Statement explains:
What information we collect and why we collect it
How we use that information and when we disclose it to others
Your rights regarding that information, including how to access and update your information
The steps we take to protect your information
This Privacy Statement applies to information that we obtain through the Site and Services. This Statement does not apply to personal information relating to Lattice’s employment-related activities.
Lattice is a US-based company that offers our Services to domestic and international business clients. As a result, information that we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to our U.S. offices to permit us to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, to provide information and services to prospective and current clients, and to perform related business activities. In addition, we may provide information to third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to the extent necessary to support Lattice’s business activities, and we may access personal information collected by our customers to support the Services that we provide to our customers. As a result, personal information may be transferred to and stored on servers located in the United States and in countries different from the country in which that information was initially collected. Similarly, information we collect may be accessed by Lattice and our third-party service providers and business partners from countries other than the ones in which the information is stored.
Types of Data We Collect. We collect personal information from users, as described below.
(a) Information You Provide to Us.
We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, username and password when you create an account to log in to our Services (“Account”).
We will collect payment information necessary to complete transactions, including your name, credit card information, and billing information.
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
If you have created an Account and upload any goal, project,objective information, performance reviews, peer feedback, or other materials to the Services, we will collect those materials in order to provide you the Services you request.

If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on our Services, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last name, and sometimes postal address to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.
We also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected.

This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
