Cookies also may be used to collect transaction information for promotions conducted on the Sites. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer system or files, and only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie. You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to access your account information or make purchases on or similarly use the Sites.
(c) Pixel Tags:
(i) We use “pixel tags” (also called “web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on the Sites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Sites. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.
(ii) Pixel tags on the Sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Sites. This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information and other technical information about your computer.

(d) Other Information: As you interact with us, certain information may be collected passively, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, or the MAC address of a wireless device that you may be using to access the Sites. This helps us identify you and provide better service to you. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

To make sure that you are accessing our secure server before you submit personally identifiable financial information, look at your browser’s security level indicator to the right of the address bar or lower right corner of the window. If you see a solid key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from “http” to “https.”
