Below you'll find answers to our members' most frequently asked questions. Before contacting us, we recommend checking within our FAQ just in case your question has already been answered.
How Lavalife Works
How do “likes” work?
Clicking the heart icon on someone else’s profile in search, mini profile or full profile view shows that specific Lavalife.com user that you’re interested in them, or that you like their profile. You can see the likes that your profile has received by clicking on the heart icon in your notifications bar in the upper right hand corner of the screen. You can unlike someone’s profile at any point by returning to their profile and clicking the heart icon once more, so that it changes back from red to clear.
How do “favorites” work?
Clicking the star icon on someone else’s profile in search, mini profile or full profile view adds that particular profile to your “Favorites” list. Think of this list as a collection of bookmarked profiles. The person that you’ve added to your list doesn’t know they’ve been added. So, you can keep tabs on your favorite profiles or favorite a few to go back to and read in full later on. Just like “likes”, you can unfavorite a profile by returning to the profile and clicking the star icon once more, so that it changes back from yellow to clear.
How do “views” work?
The eye icon in your notifications bar shows you a list of other Lavalife.com users who have recently viewed your profile. When you view someone else’s profile, you will appear within their list. This is a handy way to see how popular your profile has been recently and to follow up with anyone you might be interested in.
How do messages work?
The message center is where all your sent and received messages are stored. The envelope icon in your notifications bar will show you a running total of all new messages received. As you read through your messages, you’ll notice the notification number decreasing until the notifications clear. You can also delete a message, click through to view a user’s full profile and even block a user directly from your message center.
Are there fake profiles on Lavalife.com?
We never have and never will have fake profiles on Lavalife.com. We believe in connecting real local singles with other real local singles, and that’s what we promise to continue to do.
Is Lavalife.com free?
It’s always free to join Lavalife.com and to try it for a week. But, after the week, you’ll be notified that your free trial period is up and will be prompted to purchase a monthly subscription membership.
Can I use the same login for Lavalife.com and the Lavalife mobile app?
Yes! Lavalife.com and the Lavalife mobile app are directly linked, so you can use one set of logins for both platforms. Any changes you make to your profile on the app will also be changed on your Lavalife.com profile and vice versa. Take Lavalife with you on-the-go with our mobile app available for iOS and Android devices.
Another user or his/her profile content is bothering me on Lavalife.com. What can I do?
We take all user misconduct very seriously and strongly urge you to report and block any harassing or bothersome behavior. Our team of dedicated customer service professionals carefully review and appropriately action any and all flagged profiles, messages and activity as quickly as possible. Your safety is our priority here at Lavalife. Please never hesitate to contact us if we can help make your experience a more enjoyable one.
Making the Most out of Lavalife.com
How do I choose the best profile picture?
A good profile picture can make or break an online dating profile’s success. A general rule is to use a photo taken within the last year and to frame your upper body and face. On the Lavalife blog, we regularly post tips and advice on how to make your Lavalife.com experience the best it can be. Click here to read more about how to take a great profile picture.
How do I write a great “About Me”?
When it comes to writing your “About Me” section, it is important to play up the positives and avoid focusing on the negatives. You also want to be truthful, upfront and put your best self forward. For more tips and advice on how to write a great “About Me,” click here and here.
How do I use the search function to find the right profiles for me?
Seeing too many results at once can be overwhelming, and we understand that! That’s why we offer two ways to narrow down your results. First, use the “Basic Search” to quickly narrow down your search results to see people looking for the same relationship type as you, within your preferred age range and within a specific distance. Then, use the “Advanced Search” to select more specific search criteria that will help comb through results and present you with people who most closely match what you’re looking for.
How do I use the “In Common” feature to break the ice?
Lavalife.com’s “In Common” feature allows you to see what another user has in common with you straight away, so you can break the ice by sending a message about something you both enjoy. Do you have a specific sport in common? If so, ask about his or her favorite team. Do you both enjoy gourmet cooking? Ask about the last recipe they enjoyed. Our “In Common” feature is all about cutting through the noise and highlighting your common ground faster, helping you to strike up a conversation and get things moving.
Privacy and Security
Will other users see my personal contact information?
No Lavalife.com users will never see your personal contact information, including your real first and last names. All we show is what you include on your public profile. If you choose to share personally identifiable information within private messages (something we generally advise against unless you have decided to meet offline for a date), then that’s up to you. For more information on how we store and use your personal information, please visit our Privacy Policy page.
Can anyone see my photos?
Any photo that you upload to Lavalife.com is viewable to other Lavalife.com members. If you don’t want other users to see a photo, we strongly advise you to not to upload it to Lavalife.com as it will be made publicly viewable immediately. While it’s unlikely, it’s always possible that search engines may index images from our website. However, we make every effort to prevent this from happening.
Do you share my email address or contact information with third parties?
We don’t rent, trade or sell our members’ or subscribers’ email addresses with any third party. We care deeply about your privacy and ensure it’s respected at every turn. We use StreamSend, a reputable and trusted email service provider, to send relevant, interesting email content to email addresses that have opted into email communication and always maintain complete ownership and control over our own email database. To unsubscribe from email communication, please visit your Preferences Centre.

Do you monitor all sent and received messages?
We don’t monitor or screen sent and received private messages. We do, however, read and action any and all messages flagged as inappropriate. For more information on what is and isn’t acceptable on Lavalife.com, please read our Code of Ethics.
How do I know I can trust Lavalife.com?
Lavalife.com was one of the very first names in the online dating space and continues to be a trusted choice of thousands of online daters every single day. We carefully screen all new members, respond to and action all reports of misconduct as soon as possible, and process all credit card transactions in accordance with best practices. All transactions are processed via our secure payment system, keeping your safety and security as our top priority.
Billing and Account
Why do you need my real first and last names?
Your first and last name will never be revealed to other Lavalife.com members. We require this information for a couple of reasons. First, maintaining accurate and detailed records of all our member is one of the ways we are able to maintain a safe online dating experience. Second, we require this information for all credit card transactions and pre-authorized automatic subscription renewals. You can rest assured that your personal information will never be released on the website or shared with any third party. For more information on our Privacy Policy, click here.
How much does it cost to have a Lavalife.com membership?
As of January 5, 2015 we’ll be introducing new monthly subscription options ranging from $19.99 to $89.99.
Will you charge my credit card without my permission?
We’ll never charge your credit card without your permission. When you sign up for a monthly subscription, you have the opportunity to opt out of auto renewal. If you opt out of this feature, we’ll only charge your card for the amount specified as a one-time charge. If you remain opted into the auto renewal feature, you’ll see a recurring charge in the amount specified and at the frequency specified beginning the month your initially purchased subscription expires. For example, if you purchase a three month package at $49.99, you will be charged an additional $49.99 on the fourth month, which will then extend your subscription an additional three months and so on and so forth.
How do I cancel my account?
For information and instructions on how to cancel your Lavalife.com membership account, please click here.

COMING SOON
THIS AGREEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED ON AUGUST 13, 2009.
Lavalife is firmly committed to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, including the Lavalife®, Manline® and Womanline™ communities.
The protection of your privacy being very important, we have adopted the following practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. We will notify all registered users via email of any material change to this Privacy Policy, unless you have opted-out of receiving email from us. From time to time, changes to this Privacy Policy will also be communicated on this site.
What information do you gather automatically from visitors?
We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about you.
We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected if you have set your browser to reject cookies.
What information will you ask me for?
When you register to use any Lavalife service you will be asked for some general information, which enables us to provide you with this individualized service. We gather contact information (like your email address), demographic information (like your city of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become a Full Member, we collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date). We will only use this information in the course of providing our service to you.
Once you have registered, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile (nickname and personal description) within any of our communities where your gender is applicable. Depending on which community you choose, you will be asked for some personal but non-identifying information to complete your profile (i.e. whether you have dependants, height, body type, race, religion, whether you smoke, etc.). This information is not linked in any way to your personally identifiable information, for other members to see. Obviously, if you provide us with a photograph or video some of your information may become personally identifiable information.
How will this information be used and who has access to it?
If you choose to have them sent to you, we may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving different types of communications from us at the point where we request registration information. You may modify this choice at any time by selecting "Preferences" from the member home page. We reserve the right to use your contact information at any time to advise you of any updates that may materially affect your rights or status on our site.
Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, allow us to forward you further search results, to compose your personal profile—which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created—and to deliver targeted advertising and promotional offers to you from us and from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your demographic profile. Lavalife promotional offers and service information maybe sent to your contact email from time to time as well as to your Lavalife mailbox. In respect of all other promotions, only your Lavalife mailbox, and not your contact email or other contact information may be made available to other members or organizations unless you have initiated or opted in to receive information or emails from the member or organization.
In the event that you decide to become a Full Member of Lavalife's community, you will be asked for your financial information (like your credit card number) , which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon—located at the bottom of your browser—appears "locked.”
The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. Additionally, we may, from time to time, use this information to identify other members that fit your search criteria and to contact you with the profiles of those members or to provide other members with your profile. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Lavalife.
Although Lavalife makes use of up-to-date technology in order to protect your pictures and video recordings from being copied or captured by unauthorized third parties, please keep in mind that we cannot ensure complete protection. When we use your pictures in our service or our marketing materials we include the Lavalife logo to serve as notice to third parties not to copy or use the pictures. The presence of this logo, or watermark does not in anyway imply copyright or other proprietary rights in and to the picture by Lavalife and is merely provided to discourage the unauthorized use of the picture.
How long do you keep the information I've given you?
We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
Can I change the information I have already given you?
You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "My Account" from the main menu on the site.
Any such request may also be made by contacting the Lavalife Privacy Officer at the co-ordinates listed at the bottom of this page.
Do you monitor online behavior?
Our members communicate with each other through instant messages and onsite mail. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Policy. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.
Members may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personally identifiable information linked to the individual voters.
What security features do you have?
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet; it ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at the coordinates listed below.
Advertisers
When you inquire about advertising opportunities on our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your advertising objectives. This information will be used to provide you with the business information you are seeking. Your information is only shared with internal staff and the external ad representation agencies that sell media space on the site, on our behalf. Lavalife sites may contain links to other sites not affiliated with Lavalife. Please note that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from those of Lavalife. We have no control over any personal information that you provide to these sites.
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here.
Associates
When you register to become an Associate of our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your site. Your information will only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives without your consent, unless required to do so by operation of law. Your information will be used to secure your approval as an Associate, to facilitate communication between our two sites and to send you payment, based on your site's performance.
