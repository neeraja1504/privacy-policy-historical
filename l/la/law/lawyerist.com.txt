Data Security Precautions
Lawyerist uses a variety of data security practices to help ensure as much security as possible. There is no such thing as perfect data security, but we use SSL encryption on our website and, to the best of our knowledge, all third-party data hosting we use also employs SSL. We require that all employees with access to user data have a VPN installed on their devices, use an encrypted password manager, and activate hardware encryption for their work devices.
