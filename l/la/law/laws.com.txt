Such third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal information except to provide their services, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements, which limit their use of such information. Sharing your resume with third parties. Our searchable database of job postings and resumes enables third parties, such as employers, recruiters, data collectors, marketers and others, to see your personal information, and to contact you.

We do not control these third parties, and we are not responsible for their use of the personal information you make available on our website. Therefore, you should avoid posting sensitive information in your personal profile. We share personal information with third parties to help us in the delivery of our services to you.

Or, if you indicate by configuring your profile that you wish to receive information about the services of third parties, we supply your contact information to these third parties for the purpose of their communicating with you. We use the information we have about you to determine, whether you might be interested in the services of a third party. You may control the information and status of your resume.

Your resume must not contain any information you do not wish to share with a potential employer. Producing personalized advertising.

However, we may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of members who will see their advertisements, and we may use non-personal information to select the appropriate audience for these advertisements.
