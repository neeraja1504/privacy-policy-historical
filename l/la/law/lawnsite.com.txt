Web Analytics Privacy and Cookie Policy
Group C Media, Inc. and its web properties use a third party provider to track various online advertisement programs with a goal to understand and to help others understand how people are using their computers and the Internet in the United States and throughout the world.
Collection and Use Information
We use cookies (both flash and non–flash) to gather statistical information that is designed to assist in understanding what users find interesting and useful on our clients’ Web sites. A cookie is a small text file containing a random and unique identifier (e.g., #12489) that is sent to your browser from a Web server and then stored onto your computer’s hard drive. Through modification of browser preferences, a user can elect to accept all cookies, receive notification when a cookie is set or decline all cookies (specific instructions are set forth below). Alterations to these settings may, however, affect the functionality of certain websites.
We may also embed a piece of code (sometimes referred to as “1×1 clear pixel,” “Web beacon” or “clear GIF”) in the pages of certain client websites in order to gather additional statistical site usage information.
The technology used by Group C Media, Inc. and its web properties is not intended to collect personally identifiable information. In some limited circumstances, however, some personally identifiable may be captured–when, for example, personal information such as an email address is incorporated into a URL string. Group C Media, Inc. does NOT use personally identifiable information inadvertently captured in this manner, nor will we ever share any of this personally identifiable information with our clients.
Updating Customer Details
It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don’t miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products. Please email any changes to your personal information to webmaster@groupc.com.

Group C Media, Inc. does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. When necessary underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent of guardian has informed us that these details have been collected.
