Any personal data we collect during registration is designed to allow us to personalise the site for you and give you access to the right kinds of information.
If you register, request further information or contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence and incorporate the information it contains into our database(s).

Internet security
The web server that hosts this site is not used to store personal information of any kind.
Any personal information that you do provide is stored on a separate and secure database server within the University's firewall. There is no direct link between this database server and the internet and access is strictly limited to internal University IT staff and authorised site administrators only.
Access to certain areas of the site is limited to specific registered user groups only. Registering as an accepted applicant or active is restricted; we will verify your status before granting a user account of this type. If your status changes then your user account may be withdrawn or downgraded to 'general visitor' without further notice.
Whilst we do not directly track or record your usage of this website, in the event that we become aware that site security has been compromised as a result of external activity (including but not limited to external security attacks) we shall take reasonable measures which we deem appropriate. This includes but is not limited to internal investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.
This privacy policy may not apply to you if we believe you are misusing the website or if we are required to disclose information by a court of law or other relevant body.
