Lakehouse.com - Privacy Policy
Lakehouse.com recognizes that the growth of the Internet has created substantial privacy concerns.
Online privacy concerns focus primarily on the protection of "customer identifiable" information which an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information that, when associated with an individual identifies that individual, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
Lakehouse.com has put in place the following Online Privacy Policy.
Collection and Use: Lakehouse.com will collect and use customer identifiable information for billing purposes, to provide service, or to create and inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. We will not disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you.
Lakehouse.com servers receive usage data when customers visit Lakehouse.com Web sites. Lakehouse.com will not use information about your activities on the Internet together with any information that identifies you without your consent.
Lakehouse.com does not supply customer identifiable information to advertising companies or to individual advertisers or other third parties.
Disclosure: Lakehouse.com will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for or use of an Lakehouse.com online service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others). Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at the Lakehouse.com Web Site to purchase Lakehouse.com products and services will be protected just as if the information had been provided under more traditional ways of ordering that service.
Security: Lakehouse.com has implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available.
E-mail Contents: Lakehouse.com will not read or disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are transmitted using Lakehouse.com services except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law.
Improper Conduct: Lakehouse.com may also use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity.
Account Information: Lakehouse.com honors requests from customers to review all customer identifiable information maintained in reasonably retrievable form, which currently consists of your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or billing information, and will correct any such information which may be inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.
Customer Concerns: If you are a consumer with concerns about the Lakehouse.com online privacy policy or its implementation you may contact us at 817-368-8010.
Changes in Practices: Lakehouse.com will keep this Policy current. The company will inform you of any changes that we make.
