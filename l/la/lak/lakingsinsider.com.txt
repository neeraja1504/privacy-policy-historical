We may also process data to protect the vital interests of individuals, or on certain public interest grounds, each to the extent allowed under applicable law.
Personalization, Marketing and Advertising
Entertainment is personal, and we are always working to help you find the events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend products and services that are personalized to our prior customers, we may link together personal data processed for the following purposes:
when you make a purchase or other transaction through our Service;
when you attend Kings Events;
when you access and use our online Services; and
when you enter a contest or other promotion.
We use this information for our legitimate interests in:
market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services;
personalizing the Services and future offers you see;
creating aggregate data; and
marketing communications.
We may also process this personal data for targeted advertising. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising only with appropriate consent.
Aggregated data
We will collect and aggregate on an anonymous basis information about you, your spending and use of our Services with information about other users of the Services in order to identify trends (“Aggregated Data”). We may pass Aggregated Data to the third parties referred to in the section below, to give them a better understanding of our business and to bring you a better service. Aggregated Data will not contain information that personally identifies you.
Marketing communications
Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our third party partners) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us, as permitted by applicable law. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with, or submission of User Content to, us. These communications may be personalized or customized based on your user profile. Similarly, we may also collect device data and contact data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate preferences data based on these interactions.
Personalization and profiling
We or other companies in Our Group will combine any personal data about you that we receive from you, from other companies in Our Group, and from third-parties in order to create marketing profiles.
Marketing profiles include personal data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, information about when you have visited Kings Events in the past and which parts of the building you visited or events you attended, demographic data and data from your social media profiles.
For example, we may analyze the personal data of people who have purchased tickets for a particular Kings Event, and then compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in our database who have similar personal data to the original purchasers, we may then target marketing about that Kings Event to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending direct marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.
Targeted Advertising
Our Group, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third-party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of personal data for targeted, behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from personalization and profiling. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective.
These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.
We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).
Sharing your personal data
In order to streamline certain business operations, improve Service personalization and behavioral marketing, develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers, and promote information we believe will be of interest to you, we will share your personal data with other companies in Our Group, as well as any other current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies of the L.A. Kings.
In connection with our general business operations, product/service improvements, to enable certain features, and in connection with our other legitimate business interests, we may share your personal data with service providers who provide certain services or process data on our behalf. We may also share information with or receive it from third party operators of Kings Events.
In order to improve personalization, deliver more relevant advertisements, and develop better products and services, we may share certain personal data with current or future affiliated entities and trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may allow third parties (such as Facebook and social media advertisers, ad exchanges, data management platforms, or ad servers) to operate on our Services and process data for behavioral advertising.
Where allowed by law, or with your consent, we will share your personal data with other trusted third parties, for example the sponsors with which we work. In certain cases, these parties may use your personal data for marketing or promotional purposes by sending you information about related products or services that may be of interest to you.
If you use any social media plugin, API, or other similar feature, use an event hashtag or similar link, or otherwise interact with us or our Services via social media, we may make your post available on our Services or to the general public. We may share, rebroadcast, or redisplay personal data or other information in the post to the extent permitted by the relevant social media service.
We will also disclose your personal data to third parties in the following circumstances:
if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us will be one of the transferred assets;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;
in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or
to protect the rights, property, or safety of Our Group, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal data with other organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
International transfers of your personal data
If you are located outside the US, your personal data may be transferred to and/or processed in the United States.
In particular, your personal data may also be processed by staff operating in the United States, other members of Our Group or third-party data processors. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of our Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services.
Some countries outside Europe do not have laws that protect your privacy rights as extensively as those in Europe. However, if we do transfer your personal data to other territories, we will put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data are properly protected and processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Those safeguards include imposing contractual obligations of adequacy or requiring the recipient to subscribe to or be certified with an ‘international framework’ of protection. You can obtain more information about the safeguards we put in place by contacting us using the information below.
How long do we keep your personal data?
We retain information for so long as it, in our discretion, remains relevant to its purpose, and in any event, for so long as is required by law. We will periodically review retention periods, and may sometimes pseudonymize or anonymize data held for longer periods, if appropriate.
However, in some circumstances we will retain your personal data for a shorter period, such as CCTV footage, which will be retained as required by law. Similarly, we will retain your personal data for longer if we believe we may need them in order to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, and we will retain your personal data for longer if we are required to retain them in order to comply with applicable laws.
We will retain your personal data in accordance with data protection law and for so long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.

Individuals under the age of 18 in California can delete or remove posts using the same deletion or removal procedures described above, or otherwise made available through the Services. If you have questions about how to remove your posts or if you would like additional assistance with deletion you can contact us. We will work to delete your information, but we cannot guarantee comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the Services.
Your Choices
You may control or limit location data that we collect through our Services by changing your preferences in your device’s location services preferences menu, or through your choices regarding the use of Bluetooth, WiFi, and other network interfaces you may use to interact with our Services. However, please note that use of RFID technologies may be necessary for the functioning of hardware required for certain processing of personal data.
Our Services do not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can manage/deny cookies (and certain technologies) using your browser’s settings menu. You must opt out of third-party services directly via the third party. For example, to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit Google Analytics Terms of Use, the Google Privacy Policy, or Google Analytics Opt-out.
You may opt out or withdraw your consent to behavioral advertising. You must opt out of third-party services directly via the third party. For example, to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit Google’s Ads Settings, here. To opt out from Facebook Custom Audience Pixel, visit their customer support page here. To learn more about how to opt out of Twitter’s use of audience pixels, visit the Twitter help page here.

You can also withdraw your consent to receive marketing communications or any other consent you have previously provided to us by contacting us using the information below.
The consequence of you withdrawing consent might be that we cannot perform certain services for you, such as location based services, the availability of personalized services or relevant advertising, or other services conditioned on your consent.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
You may also make a complaint to a supervisory authority for data protection matters. Complaints should be directed to the appropriate supervisory authority in your jurisdiction. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.
How do we protect your personal data?
We use industry standard technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data. We keep your personal data secure by implementing policies, procedures and access controls so that only authorized members of our staff or authorized third parties can access your personal data, and we use encryption when appropriate. We protect our information technology systems with firewalls and anti-virus and anti-malware software and other information security technology solutions.
We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data when you transmit it to us. For example, if you email us your personal data, you should be aware that email is not a secure transmission method. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to us and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access one of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Links to other websites and mobile applications
We sometimes provide you with links to other websites or mobile applications, but these websites and mobile applications are not under our control. We are only responsible for the privacy practices and security of our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies, content or security of any linked websites or mobile applications. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies of each and every website and mobile application that you visit.
For example, some purchases on our Services or on our premises are handled directly by the L.A. Kings, and others are managed and processed by third-party service providers (such as axs.com, auction.nhl.com, shop.nhl.com, or shopify.com). These third parties may or may not be affiliated to the L.A. Kings, but in either case, the terms, conditions, and privacy practices of the third party, not the L.A. Kings, will govern your transaction.
Please note, the L.A. Kings mobile app is developed and operated by a third party. Please see the third party’s privacy policy for more information about how they process your personal data. This mobile application may, however, frame portions of our Services, and in these cases, you may provide information directly to us through the mobile application.
In some instances, a third party may operate or host a contest/sweepstakes on our websites or mobile applications, and collect your personal data. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest/sweepstakes, we have no control over the personal data collected and accordingly urge you to review the third party’s privacy policy before participating.
As described above, we and our third party service providers may add your personal data to our and their databases in order to inform you of upcoming events, offers or other information that may be of interest to you. We or our third-party service providers may also collect and store your purchase information and associate it with personal data held about you so that we or they can personalize services and offers for you.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
We use cookies and web beacons on our websites. Third parties also view, edit, or set their own cookies or place web beacons on our websites. Cookies and web beacons allow us and third parties to distinguish you from other users of our websites. Some of these technologies can be used by us and/or our third-party partners to identify you across platforms, devices, sites, and services. Third parties may engage in behavioral advertising using this data.
Cookies and web beacons are used by us and third parties for the following purposes:
to enable certain features of our websites (for example, to allow a customer to maintain a basket when they are shopping at an online store);
to analyze the traffic to and on our websites (for example, we can count how many people have looked at a specific page, or see how visitors move around the website when they use it, what website the visited prior to visiting our website, and use this information to understand user behaviors and improve the design and functionality of the website);
for social media integration (e.g. via third-party social media cookies) or when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter; and
to collect information about your preferences and demographics to help target advertisements which are more likely to be of interest to you using behavioral advertising;
to allow us to carry out retargeting (this includes, for example, when advertisements are presented to you for products or services which you have previously looked at on a website, but have not purchased).
The use of these technologies by such third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy, except as required by law.
Minors
Our Services are generally not directed at nor intended for use by minors, and in accordance with COPPA, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. However, parents may provide their child’s personal data if the parent or guardian wishes for their child to participate in our Bailey’s Buddies program, our youth leagues, clinics, or in connection with other programs or portions of our Services which are “directed” at children. As part of these programs, we may collect your child’s name and email address, and if you choose, their birthdate, gender, age, and other information we may request from you following signup. You may provide your consent via email, by using a credit card at check out, or other mechanism which may be allowed by COPPA. Where required, we may contact parents and guardians using the information provided in the applicable sign up form to obtain this consent. We will attempt to contact you twice, and if we have not received a response with your consent pursuant to COPPA, all information provided will be deleted.
Unless we obtain parental consent, we do not share children’s personal data with third parties (other than those providing support services for the internal operations of our Services) or use this information except to provide services directly related to the program for which a child’s information has been provided in connection with COPPA. We use that information only to provide services directly related to our Services or the particular program, such as sending your child special offers, news, team updates or other appropriate information.
You may choose to review, delete or prohibit our further use of your child’s personal data at any time. Further, you may revoke any consent you have previously provided. To do so, simply submit a request to us using the contact information below.
Except when collection is expressly allowed under COPPA or if the information has been provided by a parent (e.g. a parent registering their child for one of our programs), we will promptly delete any personal data we possess about children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information outside these contexts, please contact us at the address below.
