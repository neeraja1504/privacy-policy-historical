By sending us an electronic message (e.g., through e-mail, chat, text messaging or an online form), you may be sending us personal information (i.e., your name, address, e-mail address, etc.). We may store the name and address of the requester in order to respond to the request or otherwise resolve the subject matter of your e-mail.  Please note that electronic messages may not be transmitted securely .
If you register with a County Department or agency or request other specific information:
Some County department or agency websites may ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors requesting access to Requests for Bids, Requests for Proposals or homeowners or businesses requesting Permits, may be asked to provide their names, addresses, e-mail addresses and other pertinent information to ensure we can process and deliver the information requested. Other information may be collected at these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, to enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of providing better service.  Please note that these methods also may not be transmitted securely.

A user must provide certain contact information, such as name and address, and financial information, such as a credit/debit card number and the expiration date, in order for you to pay the total amount of your library fines and fees using our website.  Here is what you should know about the security of personal information you provide in order for us to process these transactions:
We are committed to data security and the data quality of personal information that is either available from or collected by our website.  We have taken reasonable precautions to protect such information from disclosure, loss, misuse or alteration.  We require that “secure data networks” be operated, which are protected by industry standard firewalls and password protection systems.  We additionally require that only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.
We require the use of Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) standard transmission encryption to protect transmission of users’ personal information submitted in connection with credit/debit card transactions.  SSL is a security technology designed to enable your browser to send and receive information with another server in an encrypted format.  Your browser’s security icon, usually located in the top or bottom status bar of your browser’s window, reflects the security condition of the browser.  The lock icon indicates that your browser is communication over a secure link.
