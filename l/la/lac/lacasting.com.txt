The Services are directed to a general audience.

Authorized Representatives agree to stop using the Services immediately when such authority from Talent is no longer effective. We are not obligated but reserve the right at any time to require evidence of an Authorized Representative’s authority to enter into this Privacy Policy, and act on behalf of Talent in connection with the applicable Services. If we become aware that someone other than an Authorized Representative has established, edited or otherwise modified in any way an Account Profile or Resume for a Talent, we will take steps to terminate the account and remove any corresponding information within our control.

Usage Data may be collected from the devices you use to access our Services for a variety of reasons including system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity or improve security, to assess the performance of our Services, and to tell us, for example, the website you were visiting before you came to the Services and the website you visit after you leave the Services, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.

Interacting with or Viewing Third-Party Content or Advertisements
Our Services may also contain third-party advertising, links, widgets, or similar code linking to external third-party websites, services or products that we do not control. Therefore, they are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third-party sites or services to determine how the proprietors will utilize your personal information. For example, when you load a page on our Services that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service such as a Like or Send button, or interact with a third-party ad or link on our Services, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies or use tracking devices. These third parties may use personal and non-personally identifiable information collected from your device (such as IP address or device identifier) to serve you targeted advertising or content. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party advertiser. If you would like information about targeted interest-based advertising and your choices not to accept cookies used to track your activities, go to www.youradchoices.com or www.networkadvertising.org.
5. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
How We Process Database Information About You
The Services are designed for networking, which enable Industry Professionals to search for you, view your Resume, and to contact you or your Authorized Representative. For example, personal information on your Resume may be visible to casting directors who are searching the database for new talent or Talent Representatives who are searching for their own talent accounts. Please remember that any information you disclose on your Resume may be accessed, used, and stored by Industry Professionals, and redistributed to others in any manner. We attempt to limit access to our searchable database to legitimate Industry Professionals, but we do not do background checks of our members and cannot guarantee who might gain access to the Services. Nor do we have control over how those users may use your personal information. Therefore, there is no expectation of privacy when posting, or otherwise participating in the database Services. You expressly and voluntarily accept and agree to the processing of the information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must cancel your account by following the instructions in Section 7, Choice and Opt-outs.
We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the database or other Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content or action we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms for more information regarding your appropriate use of the Services.
Information Posted Through the Services
The Services offer you the opportunity to communicate with Industry Professionals for you and Industry Professionals to share Resumes and other content. For example, if an Industry Professional posts an audition video in which you appear on the Services, it may be viewed by users of the Services and forwarded to others outside the Services. We have no control over what others may post or how those users may use the information. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when using our Services or allowing your Authorized Representative to participate on your behalf.
Personalized URL Link to Your Online Resume
You may opt-in to create a personalized URL link to your online Resume by logging in to your account and clicking “Resume Link” from the Resume drop-down menu.

Web Beacons/GIFS
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code downloads temporarily onto the device you use to access Services from our web server or third-party service provider. It is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted after that.
HTML 5
We may use HTML5 in some of our Services, including in our mobile website. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge, there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
E-tags, Cache Browsers, and Web Logs
Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identifier to improve security, analyze trends, and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times, and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identifier of the mobile device that you used to access our Services, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
