How we gather information:
We will NEVER release your personal information to any other third party without your express permission except for the sole purpose of data verification and supplementation.
When we give information to the advertisers, agencies or other companies that participate in the Service, it is in the form of grouped statistics based on members’ information while participating in the Service. The Service is designed to make it impossible for outside companies to extract personal information without your consent.
We follow rigorous security protocols within our company to safeguard any personal information you share with us.
How We Use Information:
The personal information you provide is used to customize the Service to your needs. For example, if you select cinema and music as interests, only advertisers with promotions relevant to these interests will be interested in sending you any information on their offering or events.
Advertising partners will be able to plan marketing campaigns using aggregate profile data. For example, they could choose to send a promotion to all users of the Service living in Dubai, interested in music and arts. However, they will not be able to access any individual profile data unless you’ve stated so.
