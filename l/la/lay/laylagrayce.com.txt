Privacy Policy
We value your privacy
Layla Grayce is committed not only to bringing you the finest products, but also to keeping your personal information confidential. We only require personal information from you when you place an order and will only use what you provide to process orders, ship orders and contact you if necessary. You may choose to sign up for our mailing list, but rest assured that we never share or sell your confidential information with any third parties. We compiled the following statements to explain how we collect, use and secure your information.
Security Policy
We have taken every measure to ensure that online shopping at Layla Grayce is as secure as possible. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry standard encryption technology that ensures safe transmission of your personal information. Once you enter the Checkout process (when you are ready to purchase the items you have put into your shopping cart), your connection to our server becomes secure. To confirm this, look at the bottom portion of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), you can be sure that your information is secure. You can also ensure security by checking the URL line in your browser. When you enter the secure area of our site, the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https”. If for some reason you do not see these cues, please contact us directly to place your order.
About Cookies and JavaScript
“Cookies” are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer. They find their way to your browser via a web server. They sound friendly and helpful because they are. They flag information about your activity on our website, which helps us improve our site and make it friendlier and easier to use. We never use cookies to save passwords, credit card numbers or any other confidential information. Our website also requires that JavaScript is enabled on your browser. Our servers use JavaScript to provide a more interactive shopping experience. Enabling this coding language on your browser will not affect performance, nor will it collect or store any of your personal information.
Personal information collected
Whenever you shop with Layla Grayce, we obtain information we need to complete your transaction. This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card number. We also keep records of your specific product purchases and transactions with us. We use this information to process your purchase transactions, send you marketing and promotional materials via email, and help us improve our online product assortments and services. You may always opt out of mailers, and we never share or sell any of our confidential customer information.
Third Party Advertising Partners
Layla Grayce works with third-party partners, including Google, who automatically collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site.

We will never run interest-based advertising campaigns that collect or disperse confidential information, such as email addresses, telephone numbers and credit card numbers. You can adjust your browser preferences to refuse all cookies of this kind, but doing so may limit our ability to provide an optimal and tailored shopping experience. If you wish to adjust your Google Analytics and advertising settings, please see their currently available opt-outs for the web.
