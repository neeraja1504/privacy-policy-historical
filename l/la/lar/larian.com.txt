Last update: March 20th, 2018
Larian Studios values your privacy and respects your rights to control your personal data. We aim to be transparent about what data we're collecting and why. We will protect your data like a dragon protects its treasure. We do not sell your data to third parties and we never will.
The overarching purpose of collecting your data is to improve your gaming experience. Whether we are asking you to tell us who you are and what else you like, logging and analyzing gameplay experiences for different gameplay and game experience purposes, or whether we are offering you customer support when something goes wrong, our goal is for you to enjoy our games as much as possible.
This statement explains the personal information we collect from and about you, either directly or indirectly, and how we use it. The statement also covers what choices you can make about the data we collect, and how you can control those choices. It applies to all Larian Studios Products.  It additionally applies to any Larian Studios Services, such as Larian Studios owned websites, as well as other offline interactions such as Larian Studios events or Larian Studios booths at conventions.
Please read this statement carefully to understand when you may provide personal information to us and how Larian Studios uses personal information provided. By using Larian Studios Products and Services you agree to the use of your personal information as described in this statement. The terms "we", "us", or "Larian Studios" are each intended to refer to Larian Studios.
To make the information in this statement easy to understand it's structured to highlight different points at which a typical customer would potentially share information with Larian Studios. It is broken down into the following four segments:
Learning about Larian Studios

Additional sections give more detail about How We Use Personal Information, Sharing and Disclosure, How to Access and Control Your Personal Information, Other Important Privacy Information, and How to Contact Us regarding your information.

Examples include browsing one of our websites, or attending an event Larian Studios is organizing or part of. During these interactions, in order to learn more about our Products, you may voluntarily provide some personal information, such as your name and email address. You might also provide information online via cookies or similar technologies when you visit our websites.

Purchasing Larian Studios Products
Once you have made the decision to purchase a Larian Studios Product, we sometimes offer ways for customers to purchase directly from us (for instance at larianvault.com or via Kickstarter). When you purchase from us, you may be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase. Such information may include things like your name, phone number, email, shipping address, and payment information.
We collect: your name, phone number (optional), email address, shipping address, and payment information.
Why: We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with the delivery process, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Larian Studios Products. Note that we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with your purchase of Larian Studios Products.
Using Larian Studios Products
There are three main reasons we collect information from your Larian Studios Products: (1) to offer you support in case something goes wrong, (2) to offer you improvements and updates based on usage, and (3) to make Larian Studios Products better over time.
Regarding reason number 1: when something goes wrong, you are given the option to send anonymous data to us.
Reasons number 2 and 3: in order to do this, we log and send gameplay decisions but only if you agree to this.
You can opt-out from this data collection, sharing and/or processing.
For support, we may collect:
System data. This data includes things like product version number, driver dates and version numbers, operating system details, computer hardware information (processor name, amount of memory, graphics card installed). It also includes error information provided by our Product (a dump, or the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally).
Why we collect System data: We collect this information to be able to provide you personalized customer support and to guide product improvement and customer support decisions.
For improvements and updates, we may collect:
Gameplay logs. This data includes details about your playing session but is otherwise anonymous. It records things like story decisions, combat decisions, deaths, in-game locations you have visited, in-game shopping decisions, your party and character customization decisions. (It does not include hardware or software information, IP address, email address, usernames, or anything else that does not have anything to do with playing the game.)
Why we collect Gameplay logs: We collect this information so that we can help ensure Larian Studios Products are balanced, fun, clear, working the way we intended and help predict and prevent potential problems with this Larian Studios Product and other (future) Products.

We collect: Contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, social media identifiers, and the content of your emails, chats and other communications with Larian Studios Support.

We do not share your personal information as part of this process. You can opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Electing to opt out may make the ads you see on the internet less relevant to you.
If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email address in this for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest-based advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.
