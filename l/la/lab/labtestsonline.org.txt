Aggregate Information
AACC does collect non-personal data to help us understand how the Website is being used – and how we can improve it. Our web server log also collects certain non-personal information such as the domain you are using to surf the web (e.g., users of your ISP will show up as "ISPname.com") and the page from which you linked to our site, if indeed you followed a link from elsewhere on the web.
When we collect this information, we endeavor to make any personally identifiable information non-personally identifiable by combining it with information about other individuals or by removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable to you. AACC reserves the right to share with third parties aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website.
AACC uses a third-party advertising company, eHealthcare Solutions (EHS), to serve ads when you visit the Website. EHS uses cookies to serve ads on the Website. The use of cookies enables EHS to serve more relevant ads to our users based on visits to the Website and other sites on the Internet. EHS may use non-identifying information about your visits to the Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by EHS, see their Preference Manager. You may also review eHealthcare Solutions' Privacy Policy.
