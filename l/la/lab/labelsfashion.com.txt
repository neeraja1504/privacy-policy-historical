Your privacy matters to us
The protection of your personal privacy is one of our highest priorities. In the following, we will provide you with detailed information on how we handle your data.
Collection, processing and use of personal data
You can visit our site without providing any personal details. Even when you visit us via newsletter links, we only store access data without any personal references such as:
the name of your Internet service provider
the site from which you visited us
the name of the requested file
This data is analyzed solely for the purpose of improving our services and does not allow any conclusion as to your identity.
We collect, store and process your data for the purpose of processing your order and for the possible subsequent processing of a warranty, as well as for promotional purposes.
Personal data is collected if you notify us that you are willing for it to be collected during your order, when opening a customer account or when you register for the Newsletter. We pass on your personal data to service providers used by us to assist in fulfilling your order (haulage contractors, logistics experts, payment providers).
Email Marketing
If you have subscribed separately for the Newsletter, your e-mail address will be used by our company for promotion purposes, until you unsubscribe. It is possible to cancel your registration at any time, without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs at your access provider's basic rates.
If you subscribe to our newsletter we will require you to confirm this subscription by clicking a confirmation link, after which your subscription is acknowledged (double opt-in). You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking a link at the bottom of an email campaign.
We will delete all customer data of unconfirmed or unsubscribed subscriptions after keeping them for one month in retention.
Data Security
During the ordering process your payment data is transferred in encrypted form over the Internet. By means of technical and organisational procedures we secure our website and other systems against loss, destruction, amendment and dissemination of your data by unauthorised third parties. You should always keep your access data secret and close the browser window once you have ended your communication with us, in particular if you use your computer jointly with other users.

Data encryption
One of our highest priorities at Labels is the protection of personal data. Labels BV is committed to always to handling your personal data in accordance with the provisions of European Data Protection Law (GDPR).
Thanks to modern SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, your personal data from the order form, such as name, address etc. can be stored safely on our secure server.
SSL encryption is one of the safest and most modern processes anywhere on the Web and therefore meets the highest security requirements, such as in the case of online banking.SSL offers triple protection:
your data is transferred in an encrypted form;
the form can only be returned to the server it was opened from;
checks are carried out to ensure that the data reaches the recipient complete and without alteration.
Your data is therefore kept secure from access by outsiders. This is how you can be sure that your data is safe with us:
with the locked key symbol in the browser bar
with the additional "s" (for secure) at the start of the URL (address) in https://
With SSL our website offers the best possible protection from all types of access to your personal data. Click on the certificate logo, to see the validity of the security certificate for yourself.
