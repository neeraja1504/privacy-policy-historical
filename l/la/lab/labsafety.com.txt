Protect Your Account from Online Fraud
The Internet is not immune to fraud. Criminals will use spoof e-mails, phony web sites, and other deceptive practices to try to obtain your personal information; this is known as phishing.
Spoof emails are phony emails that appear to have originated from a legitimate company. These phony emails ask you to go to a spoof web site and provide your personal account information. To bait you, often these deceptive emails may allude to an urgent matter concerning your account. In many cases, there is no easy way to determine that you are on a phony web site because the URL may contain the name of the company it is spoofing.
Security Tips:
Delete suspicious emails without opening them. If you do open a suspicious email, never click on a link or open an attachment contained in the suspicious email.
Do not provide your sensitive information by email or phone.
When entering private information, confirm your security by looking for a closed lock at the bottom of the Web page. Click on the lock icon to verify that the security certificate has been issued to Our Site.
If you believe that there is a problem with your account, please contact customer service. To report a suspicious email that uses Our name, immediately forward it to custsvc@labsafety.com or call PHONE: 1-800-356-0783 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, Monday-Friday; 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST, Saturday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST Sunday.
