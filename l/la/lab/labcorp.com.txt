What personal information does LabCorp collect?
LabCorp does not ask you to provide personal health care information to us through our web site. We obtain personally identifying information about you only if you voluntarily choose to provide such information via e-mail comment to LabCorp. Our LabCorp e-mail correspondence link specifically requests that you not include personal medical information. The LabCorp bill payment link, which allows you to make electronic payments, requests that you provide personal financial data for the payment of invoices. Information from the bill payment link does not display or transmit any personal health care information about you or from your account.
How does LabCorp protect the security of your information?
Financial information and payment data, including credit card numbers, that you provide to us via the LabCorp Internet bill payment link is encrypted by using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology which employs a 128-bit encryption system. This information may be accessed only by LabCorp employees who maintain password and job-required access rights. Additionally, LabCorp maintains all personal patient data within the LabCorp information system (IS) firewalls that operate on separate LabCorp mainframes/servers. The general public may not access these mainframes/servers.
