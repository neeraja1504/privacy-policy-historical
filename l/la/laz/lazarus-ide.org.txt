Lazarus
The Lazarus servers are located in the EU, and so are most of the core contributors to Lazarus. This means we are subject to the stipulations of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which requires us to inform you about our privacy policy, and about which data we collect about you.
What data do we collect about you?
The only personal data we collect and store are:
a name (which can be a nickname for this specific use)
an email address
There are 4 possible locations where we ask for a name and an email address:
The bugtracker
The WIKI.
The forum.
The mailing lists.
This information is stored in the respective databases that underly these information systems. This information is kept for an indeterminate period of time, as they are needed for the functioning of these communication systems.
The web server's log files of these systems contain the IP address from all requests. Occasionally they also contain a name or email address. The log files are deleted after 14 days, unless we need to analyse some problem with the server. In such cases the relevant log file may be kept longer, but will be deleted after being used.
The collected data is not communicated or sold to other parties in any way, other than what is accessible publicly through the public user interface.
You are free to use an alias and a special email address that cannot be linked to any other personal information. We will be none the wiser.
Note that because some information is displayed publicly, it can be therefore be downloaded to other servers beyond our control (such as mailing list archives).
For what is this data used?
The data is only used to be able contact you through the public websites or by email in case of bugreports.
Where can you see this information?
All recorded information is publicly accessible when you log into one of these systems, you can consult therefor all information we have on the respective websites listed above.
