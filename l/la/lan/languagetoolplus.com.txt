The processing of personal data on this website is carried out in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act, Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG 2018).
Here's how you can contact us.
Have you given us permission to use your data, e.g. by subscribing to the newsletter? You can revoke this permission at any time as described below.
We don't store the text that you submit for style and grammar checking on languagetoolplus.com, with the following exceptions:
If you explicitly submit feedback, for example about false alarms or undetected errors, we store that feedback.
In case of an internal software error (which is extremely rare), we log the sentence that caused the error so we can reproduce and fix the error.
In any case, we don't store the data with your IP address or any other meta information that would allow us to identify you. Thus it's also not possible to delete your data.
If you contact us via a contact form, your data will be transferred via an encrypted connection and stored in one of our databases.
To improve our proofreading service, we keep a log of the following information:
date and time, length of submitted text, text language, processing time on server, number of detected errors, type of detected errors (e.g. "uppercase sentence start" or "confusion of 'piece' and 'peace'"),
the page on which you submitted the request (e.g. languagetoolplus.com),
only for the browser add-on: add-on version; date of installation; random id of the text field that is being checked
only transferred when you uninstall the browser add-on: the number of times you used the add-on and the URL of the page where the add-on was last used
