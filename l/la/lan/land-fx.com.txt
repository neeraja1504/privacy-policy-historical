Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third-party websites.Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers.

In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.
Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or through, them.
