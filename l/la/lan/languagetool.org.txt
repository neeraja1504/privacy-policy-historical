LanguageTool is a proofreading software. It works by sending the text to be checked to our servers over an encrypted connection. This policy describes what kind of data we store.
The processing of personal data on this website is carried out in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act, Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG 2018).
Here's how you can contact us.
Note: If you don't want any information to be transferred, download the stand-alone version from our homepage. It works locally without internet access and thus doesn't transfer any data.
Have you given us permission to use your data, e.g. by subscribing to the newsletter? You can revoke this permission at any time as described below.
We don't store the text that you submit for style and grammar checking on languagetool.org, with the following exceptions:
If you explicitly submit feedback, for example about false alarms or undetected errors, we store that feedback.
If you accept or explicitly ignore corrections or open examples for an error, we log the internal rule id of that error (this is something like ENGLISH_WORD_REPEAT_RULE for word repetition errors).
If you accept a correction of a spelling error, we log the original word and the correction you selected.
In case of an internal software error (which is extremely rare), we log the sentence that caused the error so we can reproduce and fix the error.
In any case, we don't store the data with your IP address or any other meta information that would allow us to identify you. Thus it's also not possible to delete your data.
To improve our proofreading service, we keep a log of the following information:
date and time, length of submitted text, text language, processing time on server, number of detected errors (but not the actual errors unless you have agreed to that),
the page on which you submitted the request (referrer),
internal errors that occur (e.g. the browser add-on not being able to access the text to be checked),
the number of times you used the browser add-on (only transferred when you uninstall the add-on)
None of this information can be used to identify you.
In our web server log files, your IP address is stored in an abbreviated form (like 192.168.xxx.xxx) so it cannot be used to identify you. Error messages like for exceeding the query limit are stored with the full IP for up to 48 hours so we can prevent misuse of the service.
If you subscribe to our newsletter, your email address will be stored at our newsletter provider (newsletter2go.com, Newsletter2Go GmbH, Köpenicker Straße 126, 10179 Berlin, Germany, Privacy Policy). Your email will be deleted when you unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link that is included in every newsletter we send. You can also contact us to unsubscribe from the newsletter.
