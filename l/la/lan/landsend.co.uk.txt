What are the legal bases we rely upon when collecting your personal data?
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:
Consent
In specific situations, we collect and process your data with your consent.
An example of consent is when you tick a box to receive email newsletters.
When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.
Contractual obligations
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
An example of a contractual obligation is when you order an item from us for home delivery, we collect your address details in order to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our courier.
Legal compliance
In certain circumstances, the law requires us to collect and process your data.
An example of legal compliance is when we pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting the Partnership to law enforcement.
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers.
We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products/services.
We will also use your address details to send you direct marketing information by post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you.
