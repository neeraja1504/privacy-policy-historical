Unibake Home > Privacy & Cookies Policy

Your privacy is important to Lantmännen and we strive for a high level of protection in all our personal data processing. All personal data processing carried out within Lantmännen is performed in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Within the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies from 25 May 2018[1]. As most of Lantmännen’s companies are covered by European legislation, this policy is based on the GDPR. Local data protection legislation outside the EU/EEA will be taken into account where relevant.
Specific information regarding personal data processing might be provided in connection with Lantmännen’s Digital Channels, which, in such case, will take precedence over this general information.
What is personal data?

Restrictions on disclosure of personal data
Lantmännen may appoint external partners to perform tasks on Lantmännen’s behalf, such as providing IT services or helping with marketing, data analysis or statistics. The performance of these services may mean that Lantmännen’s partners, both within and outside the EU/EEA, gain access to your personal data.
