People who make applications
Customers who lodge applications or correspondence with us in connection with a registered title or about the registration of land and properties  are providing us with information. The use of this information is governed by the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003. This includes hold both personal and non-personal information. Official copies of registers of titles and title plans are publicly available upon payment of the prescribed fee. It is also possible to apply for or inspect copies of documents held by Land Registry including scanned electronic images. This information is also publicly available (also upon payment of ther prescribed fee) and governed by section 66 of the Land Registration Act 2002 which sets out the protocol. As the information is made available under this statutory access code, the same information is not available using the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
This information is held indefinitely. The Public Records Act 1958 as amended ordinarily requires that public records selected for permanent preservation are transferred to The National Archives once they are 20 years old. However, this requirement does not apply where the Lord Chancellor has given his approval for their retention by the body holding them. We have obtained an Instrument of Retention in respect of our registers and associated documents, which includes all the associated paperwork, which means we have physical custody of all of those records.
When we handle personal information supplied by you as part of our statutory functions, your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 are limited. The Data Protection Act 1998 permits us to use personal information for these official purposes. The information is exempt from the disclosure provisions, as it falls within section 34 of that Act. This exempts information that has to be made available to the public under legislation.
In order to maintain the integrity of the register of title we may disclose to or share with others any information we may hold – see Disclosure of personal information and Sharing Information.
People who make a complaint to us
When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. This normally contains the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in the complaint.
We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. We do compile and publish statistics but not in a form which identifies anyone.
We usually have to disclose the complainant’s identity to whoever the complaint is about. This is inevitable where, for example, the accuracy of a title is in dispute. If a complainant doesn’t want information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will, in exceptional citcumstances try to respect that but it  will not usually not be possible to handle a complaint on an anonymous basis.
We will keep personal information contained in complaint files in line with our retention policy for a period of 10 years. Our Document Disposal Policy and list is available on request. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the ‘need to know’ principle.
Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry and any subsequent issues and to check on the level of service we provide.
Usually we do not, identify any complainants unless the details have already been made public.
Information from complaint files is not available under Land Registry’s statutory inspection protocol and Open Register.
Usability Suite
Land Registry has a Usability Suite which is used by Land Registry to undertake study/research into product, service and system development. Land Registry’s Usability suite is a facility which hosts a studio where the testing takes place and an observation room where those involved in the development of products or services can observe the testing as it happens. The suite uses world leading eye tracking technology which highlights where users look and shows their immediate reactions and the distribution of their attention during a test.
Usability testing is a way of studying how easy it is to use a product, system or service by testing it with real users. Undertaking this kind of testing will help Land Registry to develop new, and refresh existing, products and service as we move to more digital services.
Customers and staff may be asked to participate in such research. This is purely voluntary and participants have the right to withdraw at any time. Participants in such studies will be given information about the research being undertaken and we will be asked to give their consent before taking part. The informed consents are held securely. The information obtained from the research project will be held for no longer than the information has a useful value.
For further information you should contact Gavin Thorne, Head of Customer and Market Insight Team: gavin.thorne@landregistry.gsi.gov.uk
People who use our other services
Land Registry offers various services to the public. For example, we send out public guides and other publications. We may use a third party to deal with some services.
We have to hold the details of those who have requested  any particular service in order to provide it. However, we only use these details to provide the service requested and for other related purposes. For example, we might use information about people who have requested a publication to carry out a survey to find out if they are happy with the level of service they received.
Job applicants, current and former employees
When individuals apply to work at Land Registry we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference,we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.
Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 24 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from that data.
Once a person has taken up employment with Land Registry, we will compile a file relating to their employment. Our Staff Information Charter sets out what we do.
Complaints or queries
Land Registry tries to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. For this reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously. We encourage people to bring it to our attention if they think that our collection or use of information is inaccurate, unfair or misleading. We would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.

However, we are happy to provide any additional information or explanation needed. Any requests for this should be sent to the address below.
Access to personal information
Land Registry tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people access to their personal information. Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access request’ under the Data Protection Act 1998. If we do hold information about you we will:
give you a description of it;
tell you why we are holding it;
tell you who it could be disclosed to; and
let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.
