Lawful basis for processing. If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and process information about you only where we have a lawful basis for doing so under applicable EU laws, including, but not limited to, The EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The lawful basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them. Our lawful basis include:
Consent. Under certain circumstances, personal information may be processed on the basis that you have consented to such processing. If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.

In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services we provide to you.
Compliance With Legal Obligations. Personal information may be processed on the basis that we have a legal obligation to perform such processing. For example, tax laws may require us to retain records of payments you made through our Services.
Legitimate Interests. This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your personal information and we do so in ways which do not interfere with your interests, freedoms and fundamental rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business.

To provide this service, Landmark may share your personal information among Landmark's wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, our service providers, and other third parties working with Landmark or a part of Landmark who we need to operate our business, which may be located in countries outside of your own. Although the data protection laws of these various countries may differ from those in your own country, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is handled as described in this Policy.

We will not use your Personal Information for a purpose that is materially different than that for which it was collected or you subsequently authorized.
We will not sell or disclose your Personal Information to a third party other than our agent doing work under our instructions.
Accountability For Onward Transfer. Landmark will not transfer personal information originating in the EU to our agent unless the agent has entered into an agreement with us requiring the agent to protect your personally identifiable information in accordance with the Principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties other than our agents, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data. We will only transfer data for limited and specified purposes. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, we remain potentially liable.

Creating a User Profile
You may create a user profile on the Landmark websites to, among other things, facilitate your purchasing of services, and to tailor your experience to your interests. We may use the information you provide in your user profile to populate other databases maintained by us and our service providers, as applicable. We also use this profile to try and ensure that you only receive information that is likely to be of interest to you. By creating a user profile, we may use the personal information you provide for these purposes.
You can view, update or remove any personal information that you have provided to us for inclusion in your user profile by amending your user profile online here https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/Updateaccount/. If you subsequently elect to remove your user profile, we reserve the right to use any personal information previously provided by you for inclusion in your user profile for record keeping and quality assurance purposes (unless we are required by law to delete or cease to process or use your personal information). Even if you choose not to create a user profile, you can still use our websites to search for services.
Your Use of Other Users Information
Certain features of our Site enable you to have access to other users of our Site. For example, you may interact with other users through seminars and various forums. You are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information about another user, including Authorized Users, that you learn through these or other portions of our Site or otherwise, to any third party without our consent and the informed consent of such other user. Our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add any user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express written informed consent.
User Generated Content
Certain portions of our Site, such as our blogs and forums, permit user generated content. If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to other persons visiting the Site. Your posting becomes public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.
Device and Connection Information
We may collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We may also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We may use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. You are able to prevent this information from being shared with us by blocking transmission at the local network level.
Cookies & Tracking Notice
Landmark uses cookies to make interactions with our websites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of our websites, Landmark's servers send a cookie to your computer or device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Landmark, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such or have previously identified yourself to Landmark), you remain anonymous to the Company.
If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. However, if you block them, you will not be able to use all of the features of our websites, including the customization features associated with creating a user profile.
Further information about cookies and other similar technology and how they work is available at allaboutcookies.org.
Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies
We use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
Site Analytics
We work with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section and other tracking means to conduct analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site. For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, including Google Analytics, to help us improve our Site's performance and user experiences. We analyze how users interact with our websites so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our customers.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We use Secured Socket Layer ( "SSL" ) software in order to encrypt the personal information that you provide to us. If your browser is SSL enabled (which most are), your transmission of personal information to us online will be encrypted. You can verify whether your personal information is transmitted using SSL encryption by confirming the symbol of a closed lock or solid key on the bottom bar of your browser window. You can also verify that your personal information will be encrypted using SSL encryption by making sure that the prefix for the web address listed for that page has changed from "http" to "https". If you do not see the appropriate symbol and the "https" prefix, you should not assume that the personal information that you are being asked to provide will be encrypted prior to transmission.
The personal information we collect from you online is stored by us and/or our service providers on databases protected through a combination of physical and electronic access controls, firewall technology and other reasonable security measures. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information and we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Where required under law, we will notify you of any such loss, misuse or alteration of personal information that may affect you so that you can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of your rights.
Social Media
Our websites may also contain plug-ins and other features that integrate third party social media platforms into our websites. You are able to click on such links. If you do so, the third parties who operate these platforms may be able to identify you, they may be able to determine how you use this website and they may link and store this information with your social media profile. Please consult the data protection policies of these social media platforms to understand what they will be doing with your personal data. If you activate these plug-ins and other features, you will be doing so at your own risk.
Apps
We may provide mobile apps that can be downloaded to your smartphone or mobile device. These apps have a variety of functionalities that enhance the customer experience. In addition to providing services, our apps may collect personal and other information that will be used in accordance with this Policy.
Minor Children
Landmark recognizes the privacy interests of minor children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's activities and interests. Minor children are not permitted to provide any personal identifiable information on or through our websites.
How to Access and Control your Personal Information
You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
Your Choices:
In some cases, you may request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to ask us to stop accessing, using, and storing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so, to request the deletion of your information, to request the restriction of processing of your personal information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. You can exercise some of these choices by logging into https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/Updateaccount/ and updating your account. For those choices which are unable to be handled on your account page, contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.
In some jurisdictions, in addition to agreeing to this Policy, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. We may seek your consent expressly in accordance with applicable laws (e.g. where the information collected is regarded to be Sensitive Personal Information under local regulations).
We will comply with any request from you not to send you direct marketing materials. When such a request is received, your contact details will be "suppressed" rather than deleted. This will ensure that your request is recorded and retained unless you provide a later consent that overrides it. If you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we will continue to send administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Services to you via email.
If you are dissatisfied with the way we process your information, you may lodge a complaint with the data protection authority ("DPA") also referred to as the Supervisory Authority, in your jurisdiction.
Changes to this Policy
Landmark may modify this Policy from time to time. When we make material changes to this Statement we will post a link to the revised Statement on the homepage of our site, and to assist you, this Policy has an effective date set out at the end of this document.
