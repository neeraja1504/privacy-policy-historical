Legal & General - Privacy policy
Protecting your personal information is extremely important to us at Legal & General. It’s especially important for a large financial company like ours, as our customers trust us to look after a huge amount of sensitive information on everything from their business affairs to their medical history.
The way we collect, use, store and share your information is equally important. Our customers expect us to manage their information privately and securely. If we don’t, they’ll lose their trust in us.
This policy tells you how we collect and process your personal information. Please take a few minutes to read it, and show it to anyone else connected to your product. This policy may be subject to future change.
What does this policy cover?
This privacy policy relates to retail customers who request a quote, purchase our products or enter into agreements with us, and individuals that we cover under employer sponsored schemes.  We have a separate privacy policy for professional business clients, which can be found on our website.
What is personal information?
When we talk about personal information we mean information about an individual that can identify them, like their name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and financial details. It can relate to customers (including prospective customers), employees, shareholders, business contacts and suppliers. Any reference to “information” or “data” in this policy is a reference to personal information about a living individual.

Where do we get our information from?
Directly from you - information you provide when you fill in forms or contact us by phone, e-mail etc.
*Information we collect about you or receive from other sources.* This could be information you provide to us electronically (through our website or an online portal, for example), information we get from your online browsing activity, information from a third party or from publicly available sources such as social media platforms or the electoral register (e.g. to detect fraudulent claims). We may also receive information if you have been dealing with a financial adviser or have been introduced to us by another company (e.g. a bank, insurer, building society, your employer or their financial adviser). Please refer to our cookie policy for more information on how we use cookies.
How do we use your information?
We use personal information that we hold about you:
To carry out our responsibilities resulting from any agreements you’ve entered into with us (e.g. to underwrite and administer your product, including processing claims) and to provide you with the information, products and services that you’ve asked from us.
To provide you with marketing information about services and products we offer across the Legal & General group which may be of interest to you. If you have opted in to receive marketing from us, based on your marketing preferences, we may deliver this information by post, telephone, e-mail, SMS or personalised online marketing via our own systems such as My Account, social media platforms and/or other third party websites e.g. YouTube.  Please note that if you choose not to receive online marketing, you will not see personalised messages using your personal data, however you may still see generic online advertising about our products and services. We will not sell your data to third parties for them to market to you. We may also send marketing to you using our “legitimate interests”, please see below for further information.
To tell you about changes to our services and products.
To comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements (including “ know your customer ” checks, or to comply with any applicable regulatory reporting or disclosure requirements).
For carrying out market research, statistical analysis and customer profiling to help us to improve our processes, products and services and generate new business (e.g. to understand digital behaviours, identify financial attitudes and develop more engaging communications).
To define our actuarial, pricing and underwriting strategies.
To run our business in an efficient and proper way. This includes testing our systems, managing our financial position, business capability, planning, communications, corporate governance, and audit.
For any other purpose that we’ve agreed with you from time to time.
When you apply for a product or to receive a service from us, the application form you fill out or the resulting contract may contain additional conditions relating to the way we use and process your personal information. These will apply in addition to the uses described in this document.
In some cases, we may use software or systems to make automated decisions (including profiling) based on the personal information we have, or collect from others. These may include:
The prevention and detection of fraud and financial crime
To perform transaction monitoring, identity verification, money laundering and sanctions checks, and to identify politically exposed individuals. We are required by law to perform these activities which may be achieved using solely automated means to make decisions about you. We may use these activities to decline the services you have requested or to stop providing existing services to you.
Providing quotes, calculating premiums and underwriting decisions
We may assess a number of factors including information about you and your health, lifestyle information such as your postcode, occupation and hazardous pursuits that you perform. These factors will be assessed against our pricing and underwriting criteria which may include statistics regarding life expectancy, illness, injury and demographic risks. For general insurance the factors may include your claims history, where you live, and the value of items you wish to insure. We may use these activities to determine the price of your product and whether we should undertake the risk of insuring you - including how much insurance should be granted to you, how much you should pay for it and whether or not to insure you in the first place.
Servicing activities such as (i) Personalising the content and design of communications and online services (such as My Account) and (ii) Determining when to provide tailored communications about your Legal & General product (e.g. as a result of changes in your personal circumstances or lifestyle) and the appropriate channel(s) to use
These may be achieved using profiling in order to predict certain characteristics about you (e.g. your economic situation, interests, personal preferences or transactional behaviour). The activities will not have a detrimental effect on you.
Using your information in accordance with data protection laws
Data protection laws require us to meet certain conditions before we’re allowed to use your personal information in the way we describe in this privacy policy. We take these responsibilities extremely seriously. To use your personal information, we’ll rely on the following conditions, depending on the activities we’re carrying out:

Complying with applicable laws : We may process your personal information to comply with any legal obligation we’re subject to.
Legitimate interests: To use your personal data for any other purpose described in this privacy policy, we’ll rely on a condition known as "legitimate interests". It’s in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with the information that we need to provide our services to you more effectively. We may use your information to:
Carry out market research and product development, which can include creating customer demographics and/or profiling.

The outcome of this assessment will determine whether we can use your personal data in the ways described in this privacy policy (except in relation to marketing, where we’ll always rely on your consent). We’ll always act reasonably and give full and proper consideration to your interests in carrying out this assessment.
Consent: We may provide you with marketing information about our services or products where you’ve provided your consent for us to do so.
