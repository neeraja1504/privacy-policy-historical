Privacy Policy - LaunchDarkly
Effective as of March 31, 2018.
By using the LaunchDarkly.com website ("service"), or any services of Catamorphic, Co ("Catamorphic"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following privacy policy ("privacy policy"). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates and all users who access our services through your account to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity, its affiliates and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use the services.
This privacy policy is effective March 31st, 2018. All previous privacy policies are here. When we update our privacy policy, we will provide a changelog that describes the differences between the two.
Who Are We?
LaunchDarkly is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform provider that serves companies looking to implement feature flags in their overall software development lifecycle. Feature flags allow software developers to change application behavior from outside of the application without redeploying their code. This has a number of benefits including a separation of risks, ability to deliver different experiences in a targeted manner, and the lower administrative burden of software release. LaunchDarkly provides a turnkey robust feature management solution that offers high availability, scalability, and audit control.
Because LaunchDarkly customers themselves have customers, language can get very confusing. In this document, we refer to our customers (Companies who utilize our platform in their software) as members (team members). We refer to the customers of those members to be "users" or "end-users". When the generic pronoun "you" is used, it is meant to refer to anyone reading this policy and can generically mean anyone who interacts with our website, a member of our services, or a user of one of our members.
This policy largely deals with members, how we keep their data safe, and how we are allowed to use their data. If you are an end-user of one of our member's services, then you should consult their privacy policy instead, as the member policy applies to the information collected instead of this policy. LaunchDarkly collects data from our members about their user under their direction, but we do not have a direct relationship with users themselves. This policy applies to the data as long as we retain the data.
This policy does not cover third party websites, products, or services even if they link to our servicesâ€”you should consider their own privacy policies carefully. If you disagree with the practices described in this policy, then you should (a) take necessary steps to remove cookies from your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue your use of our services.
How Do We Use Data?
The data we collect depends on how our services are used. We receive some data directly, like when you visit one of our web properties, sign up for a trial, or send us email. Other times, we get data indirectly, like when we record that you visited one of our websites using technologies like cookies. We also get data from third parties, like from our members when they pass data to us to process.
The collection and use of data is essential to the value that we provide as a service, as well as improve on the services we provide; but we aim to do our best to keep data safe and secure.
Data We Collect
Personal Data. We call data that identifies, or could be used to reasonably identify you as "Personal Data". We collect Personal Data in various ways, like when you register for trial accounts or interact with our sales team.

Service Data. We call data that our members send to us about their users "Service data". LaunchDarkly's core service allows our members to submit details about their end-users to enrich their experiences through our platform. Our members have a responsibility to understand the data they send to us and to take the appropriate disclosures, precautions, and responsibilities regarding the content of the service data they provide to us.
Other Data. We call any other data that is not Personal Data or Service Data "Other Data". We collect Other Data through a variety of sources. One of those sources are cookies and other technologies that record data about the use of our website. Other data that we may collect include:

LaunchDarkly's core services are not directed to minors and we request that minors do not provide to us any Personal Data. We rely on our members, when acting in the role of a Data controller, to take responsibility for making sure their users' privacy rights are respected and ensuring that the appropriate disclosures are made about third party collection and use.
Right to Access, View, or Remove Your Information
You have a right to access the personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our site or LaunchDarkly Services, we strive to make sure that your Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you tools and methods to update it quickly or delete it, unless that information is necessary for legal or business purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing new systems or fundamentally changing our existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (e.g. requests concerning information on our backup systems). Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, after data is removed from our servers, it can take some time for that data to be purged.
To request removal of your Personal Information from our site or services, contact us at privacy@launchdarkly.com. LaunchDarkly cares deeply about the sanctity of your data and our privacy team will manage each request on a case by case basis.
We totally understand your right to have us stop contacting you. We endeavor to give you the ability to control the way we contact you. You may use the the links at the bottom of each communication to opt-out of further communications.
If you are a user of one of our member's services and need to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data about you, please contact the memberâ€”in this case, they are the data controllers. We will comply with the wishes of our members should they direct us to take action about the modification/removal of collected data.
Jurisdiction
