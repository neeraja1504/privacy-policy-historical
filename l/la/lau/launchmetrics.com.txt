Launchmetrics is Controller of the personal data that you provide us. The terms « Launchmetrics », « us » or « our » mean the Fashion GPS Europe, Ltd. entity. In accordance with the applicable legislation on data protection, Launchmetrics is the Controller.
We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) certain contact information and other information about yourself when you make an inquiry on the website, and (ii) your use of the website generally. When you make an inquiry or otherwise use the website, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access our websites.
Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data protection laws. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy clearer and more understandable.
Please read this statement carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal data (“ Personal Data ”) gathered when you are using or accessing launchmetrics.com (the “ Site ”) and other interactions (e.g., customer services inquiries, newsletter, etc.).
This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“ Third Party Services ”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Launchmetrics and its affiliates, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
What Information Do We Collect and Receive?
The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Site. In connection with certain aspects of the Site, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Data. We collect the following types of information from our users:
Usage Information:
IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically.  We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Site, including your IP address and Cookie information. Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that we can analyze and improve them.
Log Data.  We do not have website “logs” as our Site is totally open. You will need to leave Personal Data only for downloading content or for request of information on our Site. A checkbox will be available on every online form you complete to make sure you consent to give us such Personal Data.
Device Identifiers.  When you access the Site by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Site. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. Some features of the Site and Site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Location Data. When you access the Site by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Site and Site. Some features of the Site, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
Aggregate Information. We collect statistical information about how, collectively, users use the Site (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Data. This statistical information cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.
* *Cookies Information:
We use Cookies and similar technologies in our Sites and Services that help us collect other information. The Sites and Services may also include Cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect information about you via the Sites and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our Cookies Policy.
Contact Information:
If you submit an inquiry through the Site, we may collect Personal Data such as your first and last name, your current job and employer, your email address and telephone number and the country where you are currently located. Before you submit an inquiry containing contact information you will be asked to tick a checkbox so we are sure that you understand the reason why we may collect such information and you will also be provided with a link to this Privacy Policy.
In order to improve the type of content you receive through our subscription channels, we use in our contact & content forms a feature that is called ‘Progressive Profiling’. It is the tool we use for marketing automation and it records your visit through Session Cookies. Once your IP is identified, the type of information that we ask you through our forms may vary when you access or download content two or more times on our website. In this way, your profile in our CRM platform is progressively enriched and allows us to offer you a unique and personalized experience through our emails according to your profile and interests.
When you submit an inquiry, you will always be asked for permission before we send marketing communication (e.g. newsletters and Discover coverage newsletter, campaign emails, etc). If you DO NOT wish anymore to receive marketing communication from us, please send us an email:dataprotection@launchmetrics.com or directly unsubscribe from marketing communication by clicking on the unsubscribe link.
You are free to explore the Site without providing any Personal Data about yourself but some information may be collected automatically, and if some information, such as account details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
To avoid features such as the ‘Progressive Profiling’ of our forms, you can always perform your browsing in incognito mode (more info here)  or deactivate your browser Cookies (Check our Cookies Policy here).

These providers do not collect any personal information or store IP address locally on their websites.
Aggregate Information:
We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.
