Keep passwords private and do not share accounts
Avoid passwords that contain common phrases like ‘password’, your own name, or details like your phone number
Try to use a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters to make passwords stronger. We recommend making a password 8 characters or longer
