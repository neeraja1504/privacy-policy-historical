Our Policy
Certain sections of lalate.com engages in permission-based marketing and collects information provided by our subscribers at our, and affiliated, websites.

After confirmation, at which time the subscriber has “opted-in,” lalate.com will assure the authenticity of the record by matching it against our database of consumers. lalate.com may then send you offers for goods and services relevant to your categories of interest.
Additionally, as part of our effort to bring lalate.com subscribers the best possible offers, subscribers will receive special offers that would be of value to any online consumer. lalate.com values your privacy.

With the exception of email transmissions conducted by a third party to its customer database, all email transmissions will be conducted by lalate.com. lalate.com databases are proprietary. However, lalate.com does, provide discretionary “optional” information such as name, postal address, zip code, age, gender, etc. to third parties for non-electronic media. lalate.com always provides notice and choice to all subscribers. Once, a subscriber un-subscribes and chooses to be removed from lalate.com, the subscriber will no longer receive any offers from lalate.com unless the subscriber later opts-in.

Data Transfer Statement, GDPR
This LALATE LLC Data Transfer Statement (“Statement”) sets forth LALATE’s policies and practices concerning the transfer of personal data across borders.
Applicability
This Statement applies to LALATE LLC and its U.S. operating businesses, as identified below (collectively and for this statement only, “LALATE”, “we”, or “us”). This Statement forms a part of each LALATE entity’s privacy policy:
Operating Entity | Representative Platform | Privacy Policy
LALATE LLC | LALATE (or LALATE.com) | https://news.lalate.com/privacy
LALATE is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will therefore be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. Data is collected, stored, used, and shared as set forth in our privacy policies.
European Users
The European Commission has determined that the transfer of personal information of its residents outside of Europe must be subject to a legal framework that adequately protects it. We transfer personal information of European Economic Area (“EEA”) residents to the U.S. (or elsewhere) based upon the following legal frameworks:
Legitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our obligations to you without transferring your personal information to the U.S.
Consent: We may transfer your personal information when we receive your express, revocable consent.
GDPR
We comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Law (“GDPR”), which governs the protection of personal data of EU residents. To find out more about GDPR, please visit the European Union’s website, at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en. EU users have the rights to: opt out of cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of their personal information; be forgotten; and data portability. We enable exercise of these rights through our products (which we reserve the right to modify). We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests. If you require assistance, please contact our Data Protection Officer. We may require additional information from you to fulfill your requests. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request imposes an unreasonable cost on us. We will afford UK-based users with all rights available to EU users, regardless of the UK’s EU member status.
Controllers and Processors
Some laws, including the GDPR, differentiate between controllers and processors of data. A “controller” has a direct relationship with you and exercises control over the use of your data. The third-party vendors that help a controller provide a service are considered “processors” because they process the controller’s customer data at the controller’s request (examples are payment processors and cloud-based hosting providers).
All LALATE entities are controllers of personal information on users who set up an account on LALATE.COM. You do not need to set up an account on LALATE to read LALATE news articles.
Dispute Resolution
We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint. We encourage you to begin by contacting our Data Protection Officer. We endeavor to respond to requests promptly. If you believe that we have not been able to address your complaint, you may seek redress through other means. For any questions, inquiries, or complaints, please contact us at Data Protection Officer at the physical address listed in our contact page.
