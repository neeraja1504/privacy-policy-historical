Brad's Deals Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website (our "Site"), our mobile apps, our Amazon Alexa Skills, and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.
What Information Do We Collect?
When you visit our Site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Site.
1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide
If you choose to purchase products or services from our partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following information:
Name
Mailing address
Email address
Credit card number, expiration date and card verification number
Home and business phone number
Other personal information (i.e. mother's maiden name)
Email Information
In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.
2. Site Use Information
Similar to other commercial web sites, our Site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the Sites visited just before and just after our Site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.
What Are Cookies? Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?
Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers' personal information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.
How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?
We use Site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Site users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.
Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Site and evaluate our Site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.
How Do We Protect Your Information?
Information Security. We have implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard personal information. We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.
Evaluation of Information Protection Practices. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.
Employee Access, Training and Expectations. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.
Communication Opt Out
If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from Brad's Deals LLC network or business partners, you can unsubscribe or follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you located at the footer of the communication.

These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you on unaffiliated websites, apps, online service for advertising, analytics, attribution, reporting, and targeted emails based items viewed on a particular website.

Personally identifiable information will only be shared if the personally identifiable information has been freely given by the user to both Brad's Deals and the third party, and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.
What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?
