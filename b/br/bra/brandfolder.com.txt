Privacy Policy
Last Updated 07/02/13
Brandfolder, Inc. (“Brandfolder” “us” or “we”) operates the www.brandfolder.com website. It is Brandfolder’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect through our website or other services. By submitting information through our website or through our related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information from Technology. Like most website operators, Brandfolder collects information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Brandfolder’s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how Brandfolder’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Brandfolder may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Brandfolder also collects information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
We also may use cookies. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Brandfolder uses cookies to help Brandfolder identify and track visitors, their usage of the Brandfolder website, and their website access preferences. Brandfolder visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Brandfolder’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Brandfolder’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Brandfolder and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
Information from You. Certain visitors to Brandfolder’s website may choose to interact with Brandfolder in ways that require Brandfolder to gather certain information. The amount and type of information that Brandfolder gathers may depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Brandfolder.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Brandfolder – by purchasing a subscription, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
We also retain information that you post or store through your account and/or on our website, including without limitation, logos, company and brand information, company bios, product images, videos, colors, fonts, drawings, company files, and other documents and materials.
If you exchange any messages through our site, we may store those as well. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. When you post messages on the message boards of our website or on our blog, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. We may also retain any messages you send through the service, and may collect information you post to the service.
We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our service through the recommendation or referral link from a third party or use third party login credentials (like Facebook), that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Brandfolder. This information could include, but is not limited to, information about any projects you are working on, any information that you permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you made public in connection with that service.
Use of Your Information. In general, information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better.

We may create anonymous data records from information (including any content uploaded by you) by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. Brandfolder reserves the right to use this information internally without restriction and disclose anonymous data to third party companies for any purpose in its discretion.
If you provide feedback on any of our services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your information.

Sharing your Information. Brandfolder discloses information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Brandfolder’s behalf or to provide services available at Brandfolder’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
