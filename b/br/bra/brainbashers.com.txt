EEA Countries (European Union countries (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway)
The BrainBashers website uses third party vendors, including Google, for its adverts, and they will show users in the EEA only non-personalised ads. Non-personalised ads are targeted using contextual information rather than the past behaviour of a user. Although these ads donâ€™t use cookies for ads personalisation, they do use cookies to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and to combat fraud and abuse.
