Data Protection Notice
A: ASSESSMENTS PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF ORGANIZATIONS (FOR TEST TAKERS)
Where we have been requested to provide an Assessment by an Organization, the Organization will be a data controller in respect of Your Information and will be responsible for Your Information including for what purposes Your Information is being collected and in what way it will be used. Your Information may include your name, email address, user details and information on your country, language, gender, age, educational background, job description, ethnicity, race and any disability, as well as your responses to the Assessment. Some of Your Information may have already been collected by the Organization or the SHL Group before you take the Assessment.
The SHL Group may invite you to participate in an Assessment on behalf of the Organization. We will score the Assessment and compile a report with the results which will be given to the authorized representatives of the Organization. If you have any query as to the identity of the Organization, please contact us by emailing dataquestions@shl.com.
B. SHL’S USE OF YOUR INFORMATION (FOR TEST TAKERS AND ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATORS)
In addition to providing Assessments on behalf of organizations, SHL also uses some of Your Information for our own purposes as described below. SHL are data controllers and are responsible for Your Information in these circumstances.
(i) TEST TAKERS
If you take an SHL Assessment for your own use (e.g. through SHL Direct or Brainbench), SHL will use responses you provide to score your Assessment and provide you with the results.
Additionally, SHL would like to use some of Your Information (including details of your ethnicity, race and any disability where it is lawful to collect this) for research purposes in order to develop and improve the assessments and services we offer. We are committed to providing equal opportunities to all people. Our research ensures that our psychometric instruments are fair and objective in the assessment of candidates and prevents unfair discrimination. It allows us to benchmark our tests against industry recognized differences for particular groups. Where we have carried out an Assessment on behalf of an Organisation, we may also request information from the Organisation as to whether you were offered a job as a result of your Assessment for research purposes. Our psychologists are bound by ethical guidelines and data protection law in the use of Your Information in research. To the extent possible, we will anonymise Your Information before carrying out such research and only those directly involved in research supporting our products will be given access to it. We may disclose the aggregated and anonymised results of our research to third parties.
We encourage all test takers to provide details of ethnicity, race and disability, where requested. However, there is no obligation to do this and if you do not provide this, it will not affect in any way the Assessment you are about to take.
Where we have appropriate permissions, SHL may ask you to participate in future test trials, surveys or for further information relating to the Assessment taken in order to help us to further research and develop our assessment processes. If you wish to stop receiving such communications, please email us at dataquestions@shl.com.
(ii) ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATORS
Where we have appropriate permissions, SHL will contact you to find out if our Assessments have been useful in the Organisation and which Test Taker was hired for the position or may use information entered by you onto our systems.
(iii) GENERAL (FOR TEST TAKERS AND ASSESSMENT ADMINSTRATORS)
Do we disclose Your Information outside the European Economic Area?
Yes, to SHL US Inc. for back up purposes and for research purposes as outlined above and to protect Your Information when it is transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the United States, SHL US Inc. complies with the US EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland.
How do we protect Your Information?
We take appropriate steps to protect Your Information both online and off-line. We use up to date storage and security techniques to protect Your Information from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss. All our employees and any third parties we engage to process Your Information are obliged to respect the confidentiality of Your Information as required under application data protection or other legislation.
How can you contact us?
Assessment administrators and direct test takers may request access to all of Your Information held by us as data controller (for which a small administrative fee may be charged), by emailing us at dataquestions@shl.com. If the Assessment has been provided on behalf of an Organization, please contact the Organization in the first instance if you would like access to Your Information.
If you have any other questions about this Notice or Your Information changes or you no longer wish to receive our services, please email us at dataquestions@shl.com and we answer your queries or correct, update or remove your details as appropriate.
