Privacy Policy | BrandVerity
Your Privacy and BrandVerity.com
BrandVerity provides subscription and contract brand monitoring services. We know that you care about how the Personal Data (as defined below) we receive about you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes BrandVerity’s privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through the website operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Site”). Our data protection practices are compliant with GDPR as we understand its laws and implications.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that BrandVerity does not own or control, or to individuals that BrandVerity does not employ or manage. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information that we receive or handle on behalf of our subscribers in our role as a service provider. Such information is governed by the terms of the applicable subscription services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy.
If, after reading through this policy carefully, you still have questions, please reach out to us at privacy@brandverity.com. You may also request a copy of this Privacy Policy by contacting us at privacy@brandverity.com.
What Types of Information Does BrandVerity Collect?
Personal Data. “Personal Data” is information that, directly or indirectly, identifies you or another individual and which may include: name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, email address, browser and device information (including IP Address), and information collected through cookies and other similar technologies. If you submit any Personal Data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Site, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Other Information. “Other Information” is any information that does not and cannot be used to reveal your identity or that of another individual, such as information which has been fully and permanently anonymized and aggregated. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Site and for other purposes described below.
How Does BrandVerity Collect Information?
We and our service providers collect Personal Data and Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through the Site: We collect information through the Site, e.g., when you request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. whitepapers), or register to use our Site.
Offline: We collect information from you offline, such as when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact a BrandVerity representative.
Through You: BrandVerity collects information such as your location or your preferred means of communication when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with Personal Data, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
Information From Other Sources: In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.
Through Your Browser or Device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Site (such as the Apps) you are using. Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. BrandVerity uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Site, help diagnose problems with its servers, administer the Site, identify security threats and for monitoring the regions from which you navigate to BrandVerity’s Site.
Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: "Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual’s device to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site. When you visit our Site, we may send one or more cookies to your device. They enable us to store information about your device which helps us, amongst other things, to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site and enhance the level of services and functions provided. We also use third parties to serve advertisements on other websites that may be of interest to you, based on information collected about your use of our Site and other websites. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie or similar on your browser. BrandVerity recognizes automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions.
By Aggregating Information: Aggregated Personal Data does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site (for example, we may aggregate Personal Data to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).

We will collect and use your Personal Data where the processing is in our legitimate business interests, such as for direct marketing and sales of BrandVerity’s Services. Our legal basis for processing Personal Data in certain circumstances will also be based on your consent to do so, a contractual basis (such as when we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you or in order to enter into a contract with you) or for legitimate interests (such as to enforce mailing-list opt-outs, account audit history or perform security forensics). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).

How Does BrandVerity Secure Personal Data About Me?
We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. We use the Transport Layer Security (TLS, also known as SSL) protocol for the exchange of data between our Site and your device.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to our Site or via our Services. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or via the Services.
For How Long Will BrandVerity Retain My Personal Data?
We will retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection, including to pursue our legitimate business interests, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce applicable agreements.
