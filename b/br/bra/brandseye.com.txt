We may compile profiles and reports based on your personal information for statistical purposes or to extend our service offering and may freely trade with such profiles and statistical data with other organisations, specifically within the communities created by sites: provided that such profiles and statistical data are not capable of identifying you as an individual, and that they will not contain any sensitive or confidential information about you.

Your information may be disclosed for the following purposes
Agents:
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose.

In the event of the purchase or restructuring of the whole or part of our business, certain intellectual property, including our customer’s information, may be transferred to another party in the normal course of business.
Credit purposes:
If we receive, compile, retain or report any account or personal information pertaining to you or your financial position, we will protect the confidentiality of that information, and in particular, will:
(a) use that information only for a purpose permitted or required in terms of the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (South Africa), other national legislation or applicable provincial legislation; and
(b) report or release that information only to you, or to another person
to the extent permitted or required by the National Credit Act, other national legislation or applicable provincial legislation; or
as directed by:
a.         your instructions; or
b.         an order of a court or the South African National Credit Tribunal.
You have the right:
(a) to be advised within a prescribed time before any adverse information is reported by us to a credit bureau and to receive a copy of that information upon request;
(b) to inspect any credit bureau file or information concerning you without charge at least once every 12 months, or by court order or at least once within reasonable period after information has been corrected or expunged to check that it has been corrected or removed; and
(c) to challenge the accuracy of the information held and require the credit bureau to investigate the accuracy of any challenged information without charge.
Where you wish to challenge any such information, you may notify the relevant credit bureau within a reasonable time, and the credit bureau will then take reasonable steps to seek credible evidence in support of the challenged information and provide you with a copy of such evidence OR remove the information from its records if it is unable to find such evidence.
Within 20 days of receiving the evidence from the credit bureau, you may initiate a complaint through the National Credit Regulator if you still remain unsatisfied.
