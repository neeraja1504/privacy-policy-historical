You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
Do we pass your information to third parties?
You consent to us sharing your personal data in the following circumstances:
(a) We may send your personal information to other group companies, affiliates and third parties to help us process your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy.
(b) We may disclose personal information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are required by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual unlawful or otherwise prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud.
(c) If our business (or any part of it) is sold or transferred at any time, the personal data we hold may form part of the assets transferred although will still only be used in accordance with this policy. Further, in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer or seller of such business or assets. We will ensure that the third parties who receive your personal information are required to keep it confidential.
Please be assured that, other than as set out here, we will not pass your personal data to a third party company without your prior consent.
How do we use your information for marketing?
We will be sending emails and push notifications of relevant content that may be of interest to you.

How long do we keep your information?
We will keep your information for a reasonable period for the purposes set out above.
Security
For your information we have certain security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of the information that we may collect. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data held by us; any sharing with us is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use good practice procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Passwords
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you post comments, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
