In the Company we are committed to making sure that absolutely everything we do is always Data-Privacy-Compliant by Design. That means that you don’t have to worry about us collecting, sharing, storing, or even worse, losing your personal data; we couldn’t even if we tried. Information that is not collected can’t be lost, stolen demanded, leaked or exposed.
We have made sure that the only information this Product saves can’t be linked back to you or anyone else. That information is very limited, non-personal and even obfuscated to make sure it can’t be associated with a particular individual. This information is for statistical purposes as it helps us improve our service and product, but also to track conversions without the need of personal data, avoiding the identification of an exact user and therefore not compromising your privacy in any way.
