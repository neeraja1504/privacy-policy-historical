Anti-Spyware Policy
Brokengold.com believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and a consumer's experience online. Therefore, we forbid any Brokengold.com employee, agent, partner, affiliate or contractor from intentionally deploying or using Spyware (as defined in this policy) on behalf of Brokengold.com. Spyware refers to any executable software application that is installed on a user's personal computer and covertly gathers and transmits PII through the user's Internet connection without the knowledge or consent of the user.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the standard operation of our servers. Such information can include the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below.
Cookies
We use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site.
While some Web browsers allow a user to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the user's computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide.
IP Address
We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.
Clear GIFs
We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.
Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, we may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide on this Site (including PII) as well as information that we may obtain elsewhere, and we may share all or some of such information with partners, prospective partners, and other affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. We may also disclose non-personally identifiable information in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights or property, this Site and/or users of this Site.
Agents
Brokengold.com may employ other companies and individuals to perform services on its behalf and on behalf of the Network Sites, such as (1) administering sweepstakes, contests and other promotions, (2) sending emails, (3) providing marketing assistance, and (4) database management and analysis. Such companies and individuals will have access to Member PII only to the extent necessary to perform their services, but will not be permitted to use it for any other purpose.
Linking of Information
We may combine information provided by a user with information obtained from other sources. Enhancing user files with this other information will allow us to provide users with more relevant services and offers. Likewise, any information entered by a user on this Site could be used to update that user's profile on third party sites.
Opt-Out of Our E-mail Promotions
When you sign up on the Site, you will automatically be registered to receive promotional offers and site updates, via e-mails, from us. Additionally, when you sign up, you will be provided with the opportunity to receive promotional offers, via e-mail, from our third party partners (including the "Jewelry Purchaser").
Users may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional e-mails from us, or our partners by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in our e-mail. We will respond to a request to "unsubscribe" as promptly as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may at any time contact users for the purpose of communicating important information about us or the Site.
Third Party Services
The information regarding unwanted or broken jewelry and/or other unwanted or Broken Gold™ pieces will be provided by the Jewelry Purchaser. Although we advise all of our partners to support this Policy, we have no control over their information handling practices and are not responsible for any failure of such partners (or unaffiliated third parties) to adhere to this Policy.
Third Party Cookies
