Broadband Speed Checker - Privacy Policy
Overview
Speedchecker Ltd ('We') are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and we shall endeavour to use any information that you provide when using this website in accordance with this privacy policy. Our policy and processes comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation introduced in May 2018.
This privacy policy is written to ensure that you understand what information we collect, how we protect any information you submit to us, how we use it and your rights and choices.
We may amend this policy from time to time by updating this page. Therefore, we suggest you check this page occasionally to ensure you are aware of and are happy with any amendments.
What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?
When you buy our products and services we may collect information from you as described below.
Information You Provide
We collect information when you register and voluntarily complete our online questionnaires and forms including signing up for newsletters we collect the information you enter.
This information includes but may not be limited to name, email address, messages and images that you send and any other information you include in one of our online forms.
Data we collect Automatically
We collect information about any orders that you place including but not limited to item information, price and payment method.
When you visit our site, we use cookies and automatic logging (see 'Cookies and Log Files') to collect information including but not limited to browser information, IP address, Location (estimated), site links.
When you use our online tools (e.g. Our Broadband Speed Checker or Availability tool) we may also collect information about the speed of your Internet Connection (determined by our tool).
Aggregated (summary) Data
We may use any data relating to the speed of your Internet connection to provide aggregated data relating to speeds in and around your area. You can see an example of this by checking our Speed in My Area page which shows other results. This is not personal information and is not linked to any personal information that we have.
Collected Location Data
This section describes how our tools determine your location and explain that it cannot be used to personally identify you.
When Speedchecker is requested to provide a location result, we may collect approximate location information that is provided or generated in any of the following ways:
GPS coordinates
Using the MAC address of wireless routers (an alphanumeric code that is unique to that hardware device)
Using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (a measurement of the strength of the access point's signal at the time it is received by the mobile device) to identify the cell ID of nearby cell towers
Using the IP address of the requesting device, Bluetooth UUID's, Received Signal Strength Indicator and associated Bluetooth data.
This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify a user. The location data along with speed tests and network measurements may be shared with third parties to compile aggregate information about network statistics and usage in particular areas.
The IP address information we collect is not associated with you or any other individual and, for this reason, is not Personal Information.
Cookies and Third-Party Data Collection
Some data is collected by third-party companies (such as Google Ads) that have content (ads) and links on our sites. Details on what this data is and how you can control it are included in detail at the end of this privacy policy.
How Is Your Data Used?
Order Processing
The information we request at the time of purchase is essential for us to provide you with our products and services. The information may also be used as necessary to process future orders and renewals.
Our Online Tools
The information we collect when you use our online tools is used for statistical purposes and analysis for management purposes in order to administer the website or improve our products and services.
If you use our broadband speed checker or availability checker tools we will use your location, postcode or telephone number to check which broadband services may be available to you, which will involve sharing those details with the providers of those broadband services, and we will also use your location or postcode, and information about the capacity of your internet connection, to aggregate anonymous statistics regarding internet usage and availability.
Internal record keeping, and administrative purposes, and to inform you about our events, services or products, or other related information that we think would be of interest to you.
To communicate marketing messages, newsletters and details of our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by post or email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications).
Marketing
Information collected during purchasing or using our website may also be used for marketing purposes. In this section we describe how this information is used with your continued consent.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes or to customise the website according to your interests.
You may at any time ask us to refrain from sending you marketing messages by sending us an email with the words UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject box or via our Contact Us page. Any marketing email you receive will also have the option to decline to receive further information of that type from us.
Information Sharing (Third Parties)
We do not sell or share your personal data with other companies or third parties without your consent.
We may disclose summary statistics about our site visitors, clients and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes. These statistics will include no personally identifying information.
If you use our Speed Checker Scheduler application, we may provide the internet connection quality information to third parties without any personal information with the exception of your IP address.
In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect precise location information, including the presence of connected devices via bluetooth and mobile ID. This information may be used by itself or aggregated and may be shared with other parties for purposes related to advertising, measuring ad performance, analytics and research. The companies we share this data with are Cuebiq, Netradar, Hivex and TwineData.
You can withdraw your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device (note that certain services may lose functionality as a result).
You can also activate your deviceâ€™s opt-out settings which will tell advertisers to not use your in-app information from that device for purposes of collecting and serving interest-based advertising.
Lawful Basis for Processing
