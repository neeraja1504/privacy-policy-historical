Find. Order. Pay. Repeat.
Once you’ve dipped into our
designer categories
via the dropdown navigation (from dresses and denim to Gucci and Saint Laurent) no doubt you’ll have your eye on at least a couple of items.
If you’ve found something you’d like to purchase, select your size (if you need a little extra guidance peruse the ‘Size & fit’ on the product page) and then click ‘Add To Bag’.
Now you can decide whether it’s time to give your credit card more of a workout or go directly to your ‘Bag’ to review and complete your order.
New customers will be required to
create an account
with Browns before their order can be processed (returning customers, you know the drill), and always do a final check on your order before payment.
Once the order has been placed, we will email may you shortly after to confirm receipt of the order before we initiate our validation process.
Finally, if everything checks out you’ll have your new things in no time.
If you have any problems, please contact our Customer Care team at
customercare@brownsfashion.com
or call +44 (0) 203 750 1241 between 9:00am - 6:00pm GMT or +1 (404) 793 0378 between 9am - 6pm (PST) Monday to Friday.
Collect from our London Boutiques
We like to give you options – so if it suits you to pick up your order in one of our stores, instead of opting for delivery to your home… then you can!
It’s pretty simple – once you’ve finished adding items to you Bag and you proceed to checkout simply select ‘Click from Boutique' as your delivery method, free of charge, and then your preferred Browns boutique. Easy, right?
Then it’s just business as usual, we will proceed with payment to complete the order and you can expect an email from us to confirm when the order is ready for pick up (usually 1-2 days). Finally, if you have ordered multiple items there’s a chance they might arrive at your chosen boutique at different times, but don’t worry – we will always keep you updated.
Order Verification
Orders may be subject to payment verification. For the protection of our customers, we want to ensure that every order we ship out is authorised by the cardholder. If your order is placed on hold, we will reach out to you immediately to ensure that any delays are minimal.

We like to be accommodating, so we’re giving you lots of options to put your payment through*

Shipping
Browns offers worldwide shipping by partnering with premium carriers (so have your signature at the ready when the postman arrives!) Oh, and any first time orders must be shipped to the billing address of your credit card so that we can make sure there’s no funny business going on.
Side note: We do not ship on the weekend or bank holidays; therefore your order will be processed the next working day.
Please select your shipping destination from the list of countries below to display the available options and charges.
Delivery
London Same Day Delivery
When you just can’t wait to get your hands on some newness, Browns has you covered with same day delivery in specific areas of London, Monday to Saturday (excluding bank holidays, because even the postman needs a holiday too you know). Orders received and processed before 11am will arrive that very day to have you kitted out! And don’t worry, if you miss the 11am deadline we will swiftly deliver the following business day.
FYI: If you were trigger happy and purchased a few different items, you may encounter two deliveries as our items can come from two separate warehouses.
The delivery window for Same Day Delivery orders is usuallly between 4pm - 6pm. If you need to make changes to your shipping address or delivery time please click here ; likewise should the carrier be unable to deliver your order, the package will be returned to Browns and a refund will be issued.
Collect from our London Boutiques
What’s better than the convenience of picking up your order in store at one of our boutiques? Well… it’s free! Now that’s always good news.
From the time when our team receive your order we anticipate it will usually take around 1-2 days for your order to be ready for pick up in the selected boutique – but we manage this by keeping you up to date via email, so keep an eye out!
Always bring along a photo ID and the confirmation email so we can be sure your order is going to the right person. If we don’t see you within 5 days, we’ll send you a little reminder to your inbox, and if we don’t see you in 7 days we will arrange a refund as unfortunately we can’t hold onto order for too long…
UK Delivery
Orders shipping to the United Kingdom will be coming to a postbox near you via DHL express post within 2-4 days.
Shipping times can vary, but we will always work hard to get your parcel to you ASAP. Deliveries will be made from Monday to Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm.
EU Delivery
The Europeans love to stay ahead of the fashion game, so Browns will be pushing out those packages in 1-4 working days after your order has been processed. Deliveries will be made between Monday to Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm, but just to let know you know - sometimes there are some delays due to customs clearance which Browns cannot be held accountable for, so please forgive us if you have to wait a few days longer.
International (Non EU) Delivery
The international deliveries have a little further to travel, so it’s only natural to expect a few extra days to receive your new things (usually delivering within 3-7 working days). Deliveries will be made between Monday to Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm, but once again please be mindful of delays via customs clearance.
Please see delivery costs below. If you can't find your country, please contact  _customer care _for more information on delivery costs.
Processing Time
We will always aim to dispatch your order within 48 hours pending product availability and credit verification, we make it our business to ensure a timely delivery of your order!
Please bear in mind that time frames are an estimation and can sometimes take a little longer during sale periods when we’re run off our favourite Louboutins!

We know there’s nothing worse than watching the clock waiting for your package to arrive, so Browns will always provide you with the necessary tracking information to watch your package like a hawk whether it’s travelling by land or sea (and of course we will always insure your package right up until arrival, naturally).

Promotions & Competitions
GENERAL
These terms and conditions (the ‘Standard Terms’), together with the terms and conditions that are specific to any Browns Competition (as defined below) (the individual 'Competition Terms'), are known as the 'Rules'. Capitalised words used in the Competition Terms shall have the same meaning as given to them in these Standard Terms. In the event of any conflict between the Competition Terms and these Standard Terms, the Competition Terms shall prevail.
The Rules apply to any competition that is promoted on the Browns website (www.brownsfashion.com) or any Browns official social media page (@brownsfashion and @brownsmens) and is promoted by Browns (South Molton Street) Limited (‘Browns’), (a 'Competition').
By entering a Competition, you agree to be bound by the Rules.
Browns reserves the right to cancel or amend all or any part of a Competition and/or the Rules without notice for any event that is outside of Brown’s reasonable control. Any changes to the Rules, or cancellation of a Competition, will be posted on the Browns website (www.Browns.com). It is the responsibility of entrants to keep themselves informed of any changes to the Rules.
In the event of any dispute regarding: (a) the Rules, (b) the conduct or results of the Competition, and/or (c) any other matter relating to a Competition (including the terms on which Browns and/or the judges award or have awarded a Prize), then the: (i) decision of Browns and/or the judges (as applicable) shall be final and unchallengeable, and (ii) no correspondence or discussion shall be entered into, comment issued, or reason given in respect of any decision made by Browns.
COMPETITION ENTRANTS
By entering the Competition, you hereby warrant that all information and imagery submitted by you in your entry is yours, and is true, accurate and complete in every respect. Browns reserves the right to verify any information contained in your entry and/or your eligibility to enter the Competition.
The Competition is only open to persons who are aged 18 or older on the date of launch of the Competition.
Entrants may be required to provide proof of identity and age.
Where a Competition is open to persons who are residing outside of the United Kingdom, no person may enter the Competition if the Competition breaches any law or regulation of the jurisdiction in which they are resident.
Browns reserves the right in its absolute discretion to disqualify any entrant if it has reasonable grounds to believe that an entrant has breached any of the Rules, any applicable law (including copyright law) or has otherwise infringed the intellectual property of any other person. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that any failure to comply with the Rules could lead to Browns disqualifying that person, without Browns giving any reason for such disqualification or granting any opportunity for challenge.
Any person that is: (a) an employee of any company involved in the Competition (including Browns); or (b) a family member of such employee, is not eligible to enter the Competition.  Browns reserves the right to disqualify any person that it knows is, or has reasonable grounds to believe is, ineligible for the Competition as a result of this Rule.
In the event that a Prize-winner is disqualified from the Competition, Browns will, unless otherwise stated in the Competition Terms, select an alternative Prize-winner in the same manner as the original Prize-winner and such selection will be subject to the Rules.
COMPETITION ENTRIES
Entries must be made by the closing date of a Competition and in the manner set out in the Competition Terms. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
There is no requirement to make any purchase in order to enter the Competition.
Unless otherwise stated in the Competition Terms, only one entry per person is permitted. In the event that Browns discovers or has reasonable grounds to believe that the same person has made multiple Entries, such person and any Entries made by them shall be disqualified and, if such Entrant has already been selected as a Prize-winner, an alternative Prize-winner will be selected in accordance with Rule 10 above.
Browns accepts no responsibility for the return of any entries.

As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to products that are faulty or not as described. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. Nothing in these Terms & Conditions will affect these legal rights.

Products may be ordered by clicking on the items you wish to purchase and then following the prompts that will appear on-screen. You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order to us by clicking the "Pay Now" button on the checkout page.
After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order and giving you an order reference number. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We are not obliged to accept your order and may, at our discretion, decline to accept any order. You do, however, acknowledge that by clicking on the "Pay Now" button, you enter into an obligation to pay for the Product(s). Where we accept your order, we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the Product has been despatched ( Despatch Confirmation ). The contract between you and us in relation to the Product(s) ordered ( Contract ) will only be formed when we send you the Despatch Confirmation. After entering into the Contract, we will be under a legal duty to supply you with goods that are in conformity with the Contract.
The Contract will relate only to the Product(s) whose despatch we have confirmed in the Despatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Product(s) which may have been part of your order until the despatch of such Product(s) has been confirmed in a separate Despatch Confirmation.
Delivery
Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Despatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days after the date of the Despatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Your order will be delivered to the delivery address you specify when placing your order.
If your delivery address is geographically remote, for example certain outlying islands or other isolated locations, it is possible that we may not be able to deliver there. If that is the case, we will notify you before we accept your order. We reserve the right not to deliver to any country that is prohibited by applicable export laws. Orders cannot be delivered to PO Box or similar addresses.
Products comprised within the same order cannot be delivered to different addresses.
Deliveries are made by our trusted courier and take place on Monday to Saturday (or other normal working week days in countries that do not follow a Western pattern of working week), excluding bank and public holidays, usually within the hours of 8am and 5pm. It is not possible to specify a precise time at which a delivery will take place. Please note that the courier may require deliveries to be signed for.
If you order Product(s) for international delivery, they may be opened and inspected by customs authorities and may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order. In the event that you return an item, the import duties will be refunded if they were originally included in the purchase price. If they were not included then you will responsible for reclaiming duty directly from your local customs office.
Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Product(s) are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.
Risk & Ownership
The Product(s) ordered will be at your risk from the time of delivery or collection (as the case may be). Ownership of the Product(s) ordered will also pass to you on delivery or collection (as the case may be), provided full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including any delivery charges, has been received.
Price & Payment
The price of Products is as quoted on the Site from time to time.
Prices include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be automatically added (at the cost shown) to the total amount due when you view the items in your shopping basket, and have selected your chosen different delivery method.
Prices and delivery costs are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Despatch Confirmation.
The Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on the Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our despatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge you the lower amount. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on the Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before despatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.
Payment for all orders must be made by credit or debit card on the checkout page. We accept payment by most major credit and debit cards.
You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. We also carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card, and Products will not be despatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.
From time to time we may run promotions where we issue discount codes. These can be used in part-payment of the price of Product(s) ordered online, subject to the Terms & Conditions under which they were issued (as indicated in our relevant promotion from which you got the code). Discount codes can only be used once, and only during the period of validity stated and only in respect of the relevant Product(s) stated. Discount codes cannot be redeemed for cash.
Returns Policy
Returned Products must conform to our returns policy below.
You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the products while they are in your possession, and you must return them in the same condition in which you receive them (except to the extent reasonably necessary to examine them). This includes the following guidelines:
Products should be returned unworn (other than to try them on), unwashed, undamaged and unused with their original tags;
footwear and accessories should be returned in the original boxes provided and inside a protective shipping box;
if the Product comes with a security tag this should be left on;
hosiery should only be returned if it is unopened and is in its original package; and
lingerie and swimwear must only be tried on over your own lingerie garments.
If you fail to comply with the above obligations (including the conditions of return), we may deduct from the refund an amount to reflect the diminished value of the Product(s) up to the full price of the Product(s).
You cannot cancel a contract for the supply of any of the following Products:
any Products that have been personalised or made to your own bespoke specifications unless such Products were damaged or faulty when delivered to you or have been incorrectly delivered (see Returns and refunds for customised Products below for more information ); and
any garments or cosmetics Products that have had a hygiene label or seal removed or broken.
Returns and refunds for customised products
Due to the nature of personalised and monogrammed Products, returns, changes or cancellations are at our discretion. In exercising this discretion, we will have regard to the level of customisation and personalisation and also reserve the right to offer a store credit rather than a monetary refund. Store credit is valid for 6 months from the date of issue. This does not affect your statutory rights. Please note, that personalised and/or customised Products may have a long lead in time before shipping, but payment will be taken at the time of or shortly after you submit your order and in advance of shipping.
Returns Process
We recommend that you return Products in their original packaging to ensure the necessary protection when in transit. Instructions for the return of the Product(s) will be included with the delivery package. When cancelling a purchase and returning Products to us you have two options available to you:
Depending on where you live, exercise your right to cancel under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 ( CCRs ). If you choose this option you will be refunded the full price for the Product(s) (subject to our Returns Policy) and the cost of standard delivery but will be liable for the organisation and cost of returning the Product(s) to us.
Use our Free Returns service. If you choose this option you can return the Products(s) for free and will be refunded the full price for the Product(s) (subject to our Returns Policy) but not the delivery charges.
We describe these two options in more detail below.
(i) Your cancellation right under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 ( CCRs )
Except in relation to certain types of Products (as set out above ), you may cancel a contract at any time before your order is delivered and up to 14 days afterwards, beginning on the day after you received the Products ("cooling-off period").
To cancel a Contract, you must clearly inform us, preferably:
by email at customercare@brownsfashion.com or by telephone on +44 (0)203 962 1241 giving us your name, address and order reference; or
by completing and returning the cancellation form [insert link] and sending it to the address set out in the form.
If you cancel an order (or part of an order) during the cooling off period, you must return the Product(s) within 14 days after the day on which you notify us of the cancellation and comply with the Returns Policy.
If you cancel a Contract between us within the 14 day cooling-off period (see above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case within 14 days after the day on which we receive the Product(s) back or (ii) if earlier, the day on which we receive evidence that you have returned the Product(s) to our returns address.
We will refund the price of the Product(s) in full (subject to any deduction we are entitled to make due to your use of or damage to the Product(s)), including the cost of standard delivery. However, we will not refund your cost of returning the Product(s) to us, and you are responsible for those costs. We will refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase, unless agreed otherwise.
(ii) Free Returns Pick Up
We offer a free collection service to all customers for Product(s) you wish to return except in relation to certain types of Products as set out in the Returns Policy. You have 14 days from receiving your order to return the Product to us. We strongly recommend that you book your free returns pick-up within 7 days of receiving your order to ensure that it arrives back in time. Please note that we can only collect returns from the same country to which your order was delivered.
To book a free returns pick-up:
Log in to  ‘My Account’
Go to  ‘Orders& Returns’
Click ‘Book A Return Collection’ next to the order you wish to return
Select the item/s you would like to return and follow the steps to schedule a pick up time and address
We will email you with your Returns Merchandise Authorisation (RMA) number, confirmation of your collection time and address, a booking reference number and returns documents.
What Happens Next?
Print out the Air Waybill (AWB) and attach it to the outside of the parcel. There will also be a copy to give to the courier. Please save a copy of the AWB for your records. You can use this to track your return shipment.
If you have been provided with a returns invoice for customs, please enclose one inside the package and attach a signed copy on the outside with the AWB.
Do not seal your package until the driver has checked the contents.
Please note that you have 30 days to contact us upon the pickup of your return to ensure that we have acknowledged it and received the Product. If you contact us after this 30 days period, we cannot guarantee a refund.
Faulty Products
If any Product you order is damaged or faulty when delivered to you or has developed a fault, you may have one or more legal remedies available to you, depending on when you make us aware of the problem, in accordance with your legal rights. If you believe a Product was delivered damaged or faulty or has developed a fault, you should inform us as soon as possible, preferably in writing, giving your name, address and order reference. Nothing in this section affects your legal rights.
Product Information
Whilst we have taken reasonable steps to depict Products as accurately as possible through the photographs and other images featured on the Site, the detailing (such as colour, pattern and texture, etc.) you see on-screen will depend on your monitor and, as such, may not exactly reflect the actual detailing of a Product when you receive it.

5. WHO DO YOU SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH?
To provide the Website and our services, we work with a number of carefully selected third parties. To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:
* **Group companies for business purposes:** Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Farfetch UK Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co.

Rest assured, their use of information is consistent with this Privacy Policy;
* **Third party service providers for business purposes:** We have subcontracted the operation of certain aspects of the Site to Black & White, a trading division of Farfetch UK Limited (company number 06400760, VAT number GB 204 0769 35). Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics
* **advertisers for marketing purposes:** we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;
* **third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:** the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;
* **to comply with legal requests:** on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and
* **aggregated information with third parties:** we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.

To provide our Website and our services, in accordance with the purposes set out above, we or Farfetch UK Limited may transfer and store the personal information that we collect from you to a destination outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), mostly to the United States. When doing so, we rely on different adequacy measures, as stated below:
* **Adequacy Decision:** We transfer the personal data that we collect from you to conduct fraud checks to Israel, which was found to have an adequate level of protection for personal data under Commission Decision 2011/61/EU of 31 January 2011.
* **Privacy Shield:** Some third party providers based in the US, where we transfer your information to, comply with the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield and have certified that adhere to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. For more information about the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website.
* **Model Clauses:** We rely in the Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e. the standard contractual clauses) pursuant to Decision 2010/87/EU when transferring your information to US service providers who do not adhere to the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield.

We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to or through our Website, and any such transmission is at your own risk. In particular, please keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information through other means of communication than the Website in a non-protected environment (such as through email, sms, online messages) then that information can be collected and used by others outside of our or your control.

2. WHO DO YOU SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH?
To provide the Website and our services, we work with a number of carefully selected third parties. To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:
* **Group companies for business purposes:** Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Browns (South Molton Street) Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co. Ltd (the “Farfetch Group”). We may share your personal information in order to operate our business and provide the Website and services. Rest assured, their use of information is consistent with this Privacy Policy;
* **Third party service providers for business purposes:** We have subcontracted the operation of certain aspects of the Site to Black & White, a trading division of Farfetch UK Limited (company number 06400760, VAT number GB 204 0769 35). Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics
* **advertisers for marketing purposes:** we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;
* **third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:** the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;
* **to comply with legal requests:** on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and
* **aggregated information with third parties:** we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.
