The next sections explain how we use your personal information.
Postcode, phone number and IP address collection for broadband availability and testing
We may ask for your postcode and optionally your landline telephone number when offering our broadband comparison and testing services or offering help with technical problems. Unless you have asked for extra investigation, this information is used only to look up the availability of broadband products and services in your area. It will not be used to contact you. We use trusted third party API services to look up broadband availability information for the postcode and/or phone number you supplied to us.
Speed tests will record your detected IP address, your tested speed and any other information you entered on the form during this or previous visits within the last 30 days. Your saved information is held in a cookie and will be displayed on the form, you may click a link to change (forget) this data if you wish. We use a trusted third party reporting supplier to record the details of speed tests. We may also optionally request your postcode during speed tests in order to supply you with useful comparative information about the broadband speed estimates, products and services available in your area, as above.
Neither we nor our service providers will use the information collected to identify or contact you, unless you have specifically asked for this, for example through our web forms such as when requesting that we investigate a technical problem you have experienced.
Postcodes, phone numbers and other information from logs may from time to time be used for testing purposes when ensuring that our website continues to give high quality accurate results for a range of real world geographical and phone line details.
The results of broadband lookups and tests performed using our tools
We may record the results of tools you make use of, such as broadband availability or speed test results. These may be used for research purposes or to personalise your experience to continue to display relevant offers and information on other site pages, or when you return on subsequent visits.
If you have requested to receive our email newsletter, these results may be recorded alongside your email address and detected IP address in order to allow us to send you the most relevant and useful email content.
We use cookies to store the history of your broadband speed tests on a particular device and web browser for up to two years. If you log in with your Facebook account, we will also associate your speed test history with your Facebook identity, allowing you to view a combined history of test results from different devices and browsers. We do not store this information on Facebook’s servers.
We may aggregate and collate the data we record from availability lookups and speed tests in order to publish research on the state of broadband in the UK. These reports may be derived from details recorded from your form data, your detected IP address or geographical information derived from your postcode. These reports may report on trends in broadband nationally, across specific broadband providers, specific types of broadband or specific broad geographical areas etc. They will not identify individual site users.
Email address, phone number and personal information collection when you request for us to contact you
If you request that we email you a copy of your checker results, your email address and the name you gave us will be used to send you a copy of your broadband availability including any postcode and phone number you entered. Details of emails sent are stored by our server. We will not contact you further unless you have requested that we do so. In future we may offer emailed copies of other results or confirmations
Our email newsletter is an opt in service, you may subscribe directly through sign up forms or by an opt in tick box on other forms, in all cases you will be sent a confirmation email link which you must accept before your free subscription is completed. If you have requested that we do so, our agents may also subscribe you to the list directly, in this case a confirmation will still be required.
While you are subscribed to the newsletter, we may contact you to provide you with details of broadband offers and promotions, including related services, we may also contact you about news stories related to broadband and about changes to the content and features of our website.
We may request that you also give us your postcode and/or phone number when you subscribe to our mailing list, as outlined above, these are only used for broadband availability lookups, so we may provide you with more relevant information about products and offers available in your postcode area or to your phone line, or to inform you of changes in the availability of broadband where you live. If you signed up for the newsletter through our speed test, we may record this information and whether your tested speed was slower than expected, and use this to offer more relevant emails.
By subscribing to our newsletter you are agreeing to be contacted by email and to have your details stored by our mailing list supplier, including supplementary information used to offer you more relevant emails. Our mailing list services are provided using a trusted third party service, MailChimp, who will store your details and track the links that you have clicked in emails to allow us to monitor the success of our campaigns.

Street address information will only be used for broadband availability and status lookups when a postcode or phone number is not adequate. We will not ask for any unnecessary information, nor will we pass your contact details on to others without your permission.

During the speed test or while leaving a review of your provider you may optionally rate the quality, reliability, customer service and speed of your broadband service. This information is collated and used to provide star ratings to help other visitors to our site make better comparisons between broadband suppliers. Ratings recorded during speed tests will not be displayed to other site users except as part of an average score. Ratings entered during a review will be displayed alongside your review.
