• Personally Identifiable Information
When you visit Our website, purchase tickets to Broadway In Chicago Shows, inquire about information by telephone or fax, become a member of the Broadway In Chicago Club, or request information about or from Us, We and/or Our business partners may request that you provide certain personally identifiable information, which refers to information that tells Us specifically who you are. This information may include your name, phone and fax number, email address, postal address or credit card information (for purchases), and possibly information relating to certain support or customer service issues. We may also collect and keep information regarding your preferred seat locations, show preferences and specific needs.
• Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of Our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g. Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
• Aggregate Information
We also collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of Our websites such as how many visitors visit specific pages, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on. This information represents a generic overview of Our users’ collective viewing habits and allows Us to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information through the use of online tracking technologies including but not limited to “pixels” and “cookies”. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website. Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising. If you wish to disable these cookies, the “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of Our website.
• Tracking Data
We also work with third-party services providers that also collect data on Our behalf. Those service providers utilize a retargeting pixel or similar technology, which is placed on Our website. The retargeting pixel fires whenever you visit Our site, and drops a cookie on your browser. This allows Our service providers to anonymously associate the browser to a random ID number in Our service providers’ databases, and ultimately serve Broadway In Chicago advertisements to you while you browse the rest of the web. Our service providers are able to access the ad inventory on the rest of the web via their integrations and partnerships with ad exchanges and networks. Our contract with our service providers does not allow the service provider to share first-party data with third-parties. If you are concerned about behaviorally targeted advertising cookies, you can visit this page to opt out.
• Public Forums
We may offer message boards, conversation pages, blogs, chat rooms, social community environments, profile pages, and other forums. The forums may not have a restricted audience.
