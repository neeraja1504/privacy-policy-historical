Please write to info@browsershots.org if you find a privacy violation, or if you have ideas for improvement.
For anonymous users
Everybody can see your screenshots, so there's no privacy at all.
If your website is NSFW, it may not show up on the public /screenshots/ page (automatic keyword filtering).
For authenticated users
Your screenshot requests will be private if you log in before you submit them.
Private screenshots will not show up on the public screenshots page and factories detail pages, and your URL will not appear on the websites search page. The result is that nobody can see your screenshots except yourself, or somebody who already knows your URL.
For search engines
Browsershots uses a robots.txt file to keep search engines away from the screenshot result pages, so that Browsershots should not appear in search results for your website. Please write to johann@browsershots.org if it does anyway.
For webmasters
Browsershots respects the robots.txt standard. You can disallow automatic screenshots of your website by adding a section like this to the robots.txt file on your server:
User-agent: Browsershots
Disallow: /
Or if you have disallowed robots, but you want to make screenshots with Browsershots, you can explicitly allow it by adding a section like this to the robots.txt file on your server:
