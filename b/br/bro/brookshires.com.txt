The Information We Collect
When you access or visit the Site, shop at Brookshire stores, sign up for or use the Products and Services, or contact Brookshire, Brookshire may collect certain personal information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card information, or other information about you or your interests (collectively referred to as “Personal Information”).  Personal Information does not include “aggregate information,” which is information Brookshire collects or receives about a group or category of persons or services, such as demographic or statistical information, or “de-identified information,” which is information from which Brookshire has removed any Personal Information.  We may provide aggregate information or other data about general groups of shoppers, shopping trends, or sales data to other companies to help them understand the demographics of our customers.
Brookshire may use Personal Information or any other information we collect or receive, along with a record of your purchases and information related to your past use of the Products and Services, to provide products and services that are useful to you, to create merchandising and promotional programs, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s navigation on the Site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may use this information to offer savings awards and other promotions that are relevant to your purchase preferences such as personally tailored coupons, offers, or other information that may be provided to us from other companies. These offers may be delivered to you in-store, at home, or online.
For example, we may request Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including:
Application and Order Forms:  If you submit an application or purchase a product or service through the Site or at a Brookshire store, we may request certain Personal Information from you.  For example, you may be required to provide contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, email, and shipping address) or financial information (such as checking account information or credit/debit card number and expiration date).  We use this information, as applicable, to process the application, fill your order, or for billing purposes.
Surveys or Contests:  From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site or in Brookshire stores. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic and personalize the Site.
Special Offers and Updates:  We will send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions.  You can sign up for these emails from us on the registration and/or Email Preferences page through the Site and cell phone text messages by visiting brookshires.com/brookshires-text-club.  We will refrain from marketing to you directly any services for which you have not opted-in, either by email or cell phone text message. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.  Please see the “Choice/Opt-out” section below.

Brookshire may disclose your Personal Information when required by law or legal process (including pursuant to court orders, subpoenas, interrogatories, or similar directive carrying the force of the law).  We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, to protect the rights, property or safety of Brookshire, other Site users, our partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants, to prevent harm or loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
However, we will not rent or sell Personal Information to any nonaffiliated company or any outside party, except in connection with the sale of a pharmacy or other business unit, or as set forth in this Policy.
Choice/Opt-Out
We provide the opportunity or choice to “opt-out” of providing your Personal Information or having your Personal Information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.  You can always choose not to provide information; however, if you choose not to provide such information, you may not be able to access or use certain Site (or mobile site) features, functions or services.  At any time, you may elect to discontinue receiving commercial messages or publications from us following the instructions included in the communication or publication you received.  You may also request that we remove or update your Personal Information, that we not disclose your Personal Information, or change your “opt out” preference by notifying us using the contact information provided below.  We will endeavor to process and respond to your request in a commercially reasonable time.
