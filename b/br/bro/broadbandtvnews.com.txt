Our Privacy Policy
Broadband TV News LLP will be what’s known as the ‘Controller’ of the personal data you provide to us. We only collect basic personal data about you which does not include any special types of information or location based information. This does however include name, address, email, company, and job description.
Why we need your data
We need to know your basic personal data in order to provide you with our daily and weekly news services as well as relevant marketing messages in line with this overall contract. We will not collect any personal data from you we do not need in order to provide and oversee this service to you.
Our website
When someone visits www.broadbandtvnews.com we use a third party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.
Our mailing list
As part of the registration process for our newsletters, we collect personal information. We use that information for a couple of reasons: to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are right and to check every now and then that you’re happy and satisfied. We don’t rent or trade email lists with other organisations and businesses.
We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletter. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter. For more information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice. You can unsubscribe to our mailings at any time of the day or night by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails or by emailing admin@broadbandtvnews.com
Why did you receive a mailing from us?
Our email marketing is permission based. If you received a mailing from us, our records indicate that (a) you have expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future (“opt-in”), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our mailings.
If you believe you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to admin@broadbandtvnews.com for review.
How can you stop receiving email from us?
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or to change your expressed interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the SafeUnsubscribe or Update Profile links at the end of any email.
How we protect your privacy
We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system.
Sharing and Usage
We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone for their promotional use without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information, and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.
However, from time to time we do send so-called ‘partnermailings’ from third parties to our database of subscribers. We always use our own mailing service provider for these mailings and never make the actual addresses available to any third-party. We send these promotional mailings – as well as banner advertising on our website and in our newsletters – in order to finance our daily news service, which is completely free of charge to our readers.
Use of Web Beacons
When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).
Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.
Events registration
When you order a ticket (or tickets) for one of our events online your name, address data, email and contact number will be stored in the third party system we are using, Eventbrite. Please be assured that we do not share your personal details with any other company without your consent. For more information, please see Eventbrite’s privacy notice.
What we do with your data
All the personal data we process is processed by our staff in the European Union, however for the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance this information is located on servers within the United States. No third parties have access to your personal data unless the law allows them to do so.
How long we keep your data
We are required under UK tax law to keep your basic personal data (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 6 years after which time it will be destroyed. Your information we use for marketing purposes will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this information.
What are your rights
If at any point you believe the information we process on you is incorrect you can request to see this information and have it corrected or deleted. If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal data, you can contact us to have the matter investigated. admin@broadbandtvnews.com
