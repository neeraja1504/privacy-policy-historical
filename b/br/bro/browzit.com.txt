PRIVACY POLICY FOR WEBSITE
OVERVIEW
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the information that we collect from visitors to and users of our websites (“Sites”), our blogs, our Applications, and our online products and services (collectively, “Services”). By visiting our Sites or using any of our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND WHY?
The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites; use our Services and Applications; and register for and/or set up registration for you or your organization’s own customers for our services/products/activities (collectively, “Events”). We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from us.
Individuals and agents of individuals may provide us information directly or indirectly by registering for an Event or by otherwise using our Services (these individuals are referred to as “Consumers”). For example, you may enter your information in order to register for an Event, or someone may enter your information on your behalf to register for the Event. In addition, individuals or organizations can use our Services to set up Events for Consumers (those who use our Services to provide a service to Consumers are referred to as “Clients”). Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about consumers who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.
Information We Collect Directly From You.
Account Information for our Sites. You may browse our Sites without creating an online account or providing us with your information, but to use certain features or to register for an Event, you may need to create an account or otherwise provide us with information. When you create an account with us or register for an Event, we may ask you to provide the following:

For example, you can indicate that you are going to participate in an Event and invite your Facebook friends to join that Event.

We may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us.

If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
