Brown Paper Tickets acts as both a "data processor" and a "data controller". Brown Paper Tickets is a data processor because our service offers a ticketing and registration system for Event Organizers to sell tickets or admission, and collect data about their attendees to admit and communicate with ticket buyers or event attendees. Brown Paper Tickets is a data controller because the information provided by Event Organizers, ticket buyers, and attendees is stored with Brown Paper Tickets to record payment transactions and attendee information.
We use, store, and process information, including personal information, about you to provide, understand, improve, and develop the Brown Paper Tickets website and services, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment, and comply with our legal obligations.
Brown Paper Tickets collects your data in two primary ways:
1.1 Information You Provide to Brown Paper Tickets

Publicly visible information may be "scraped" or indexed through third party tools or search engines.

3.4 Service Providers
Brown Paper Tickets uses a variety of third party service providers to help us provide tools and resources related to listing events and purchasing tickets through the Brown Paper Tickets website.
For example, service providers may help us provide customer service or payment services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect and to use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Privacy Policy.
3.5 Social Media
Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address in an anonymized and hashed format to share with social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our website or otherwise promote our products and services or the Brown Paper Tickets website. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products or services that may be in your interest.
The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by Brown Paper Tickets. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such provider.
3.6 Business Transfers
If Brown Paper Tickets undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
The Brown Paper Tickets system may contain links to third party websites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services ("Third Party Partners"). Brown Paper Tickets does not own or control these Third Party Partners, and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner.

5.4 Data Retention and Erasure
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide ticketing and registration services for you and to comply with our legal obligations. You have the right to request erasure of your information. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
If you have purchased a ticket or registered for an event, Brown Paper Tickets cannot remove your information before the completion of the event for business and fraud prevention purposes.
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a Brown Paper Tickets account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that account to prevent the opening of a new Brown Paper Tickets account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Brown Paper Tickets may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain the Brown Paper Tickets website to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
