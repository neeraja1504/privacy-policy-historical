Privacy Policy
Brixton’s privacy and security measures are designed with the strictest security in mind, so any personal information that you provide to Brixton is used for the purpose of receiving Brixton communications and for personalizing and enhancing your web experience with Brixton. Brixton’s privacy policy is outlined below and tells you how we collect personal information, what information we collect, how we use it, to whom we will disclose it and how you can access, change and remove your information.
HOW WE COLLECT THE INFORMATION
There are many ways that Brixton may obtain information from you: (1) via sign up on any Brixton website(s); (2) from an online, email, retail, fax or telephone purchase; (3) from navigational information about where visitors go on our website; (4) when you enter any Brixton sweepstakes/giveaways; (5) any time you submit a business reply, product, or warranty card; (6) when you sign up at a Brixton Store; (7) upon contacting customer service to request Brixton communications; and (8) upon signing up at an event. This information may be collected by Brixton or by vendors/service providers retained by Brixton and obligated to maintain your personal information in a confidential manner.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you register on-line to receive our product information, you will need to provide us with your name, address and email address. When you make a purchase through Brixton’s website, you also will need to give us your telephone number and credit card number so we can process your payment and contact you in the event of any problems with delivery. If you contact our customer service department, you may need to provide us with additional information so that we can respond to your questions or concerns as completely and thoroughly as possible. In order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced service and to better understand your preferences, we may request your gender, year of birth, sports of interest, shopping preference and product interest. Whether or not you provide this information is entirely up to you. We also may collect additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, browser version, IP address) which will provide information regarding the general use of our website. The navigational information allows us to see which areas of our website are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and services.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to us processing this personal information in one or more of the ways described in this privacy policy. We will primarily use your personal information to provide products and services to you, for example:
To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature and to provide you with the relevant products or services (for instance to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest).
To send you information/materials via email or mail about products, offers and news we think could interest you. This information may relate to products, offers and news of Brixton. We only send you this if you have opted-in to receive Brixton catalogs or email messages.
To analyze visits to the website and learn about the interests of our visitors in the aggregate and to better understand your personal interests and needs, so we can improve our products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features and promotions that you are most interested in.
The information obtained from registration on-line is utilized to improve your web experience with Brixton by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for purchases and/or opt-in to receive occasional emails, which provide you with the latest and greatest information regarding Brixton and its products.
The information we ask for when you order on-line is used only to complete the order, to confirm the order and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow Brixton to save the information for a speedier checkout process the next time. This information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.
