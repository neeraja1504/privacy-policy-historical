During your interactions with the Site, such as when you register with the Site, Bright Hub may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, date of birth, postal address, email address, and telephone number. We use this information to validate Site users and facilitate participation in various Bright Hub services as specified on the Site.

If you send us e-mail, we will retain your email and any applicable response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have and to measure how effectively we address your concerns. Bright Hub retains such personally identifiable information only for as long as is necessary depending on the reason for your submission, and collects no more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the services for which such information is collected.

This data is not associated with any of your personal information and is not shared with any third parties.
Disclosure of Information to Third Party Vendors
Bright Hub may also use third party advertisers and service providers to help present customized content and advertisements on the Site. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar tools on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their content and advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience.
