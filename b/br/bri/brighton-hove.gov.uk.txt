Who are we?
The council is the data controller for purposes of the Data Protection Act (2018) and EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number Z5840053.
The council has an overarching Data Protection Policy which provides the high level principles we operate to. This privacy notice describes how we ensure those principles are reflected into practice and explains what we will, and will not, do with personal information.
We do not sell personal details to any external organisations. External contractors may process information on behalf of the council. We require all these contractors to make sure they keep the personal information safe and prohibiting them from doing anything other than following our instructions.
What is personal data?
Personal data includes basic details such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and notes and comments made about a person. The information may be held in paper files, electronically or both. This may include, but is not limited to: computer entries, written correspondence, emails, letters, files, photographs and video recordings.
Sensitive personal data (also known as Special Category Data) includes information on: race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health, sex life or sexual orientation.
Our approach
When processing your personal information we will always have a legal basis for doing so. The Council delivers an incredible amount of services to the community for a number of different reasons. We will only collect your personal data if:
We have obtained your explicit consent
We have a statutory obligation to do something
We have a contract in place
We are carrying out a public task or doing something in the public interest
It is in your vital interests (life or death)
Requesting your data
If you wish to request your own personal data via a Subject Access Request (SAR) please visit our data protection page. Further information on the Data Protection may be found on the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) website. the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) website.
Fraud prevention and crime
The council must safeguard public funds and we reserve the right to check the information you have provided for accuracy and to detect fraud. We may match data we hold to identify unusual matches or discrepancies; this may include matching council data with external data sources such as information held by credit reference agencies. As a result, we will use the information you provide to make sure all amounts we are owed are paid on time and ensuring any benefits you receive are appropriate. We may share your information with Debt Management agencies and the Courts to help collect any outstanding debts. We may also share your information for the same purposes with other public organisations, including neighbouring councils that handle public funds and with police forces. We may also provide forwarding address of council tenants to utility companies that are collecting outstanding debts.
We take part in the National Fraud Initiative’s anti-fraud data matching exercise.
We do our own data matching, using names, dates of birth and address. We will compare computer records held by one department, against others held by the same or other departments, to check they match. This is to make sure our information is correct and to create a customer index which can be used to help identify customers via a single customer record. Data matching is carried out on information held by the following services: Council Tax, Housing Benefits, Parking Permits including Blue Badge and Housing. We will always inform you of when and where data matching takes place when we process your data.
Sometimes we are also asked to assist in the prevention and detection of crime and therefore generally supply specific information requested by the Police or other crime detection agencies, if we are satisfied that the disclosure would be lawful and appropriate.
Other uses of data
