Glossary: What are cookies and tracking technologies?
1. WHAT INFORMATION WE MIGHT COLLECT ABOUT YOU
Data you give us : We collect information from you when you register to use our services, sign up to receive marketing emails from us or when you contact customer services. This may consist of your name, email address, billing address, payment card details and any other information you volunteer to us (for example, when you contact customer services). We’ll only use this supplementary information to deal with your query or for the purposes explained to you at the time the information was collected.
When you subscribe to BritBox, to enable us to process your payments and provide access to you, you’re required to submit: your name, email address, billing address, and payment card details.
Data we collect automatically : When you use the BritBox service, we’ll collect technical information about your use and browsing of our website and apps and about the device you’re using to access the services. For example, we receive your IP address when your device talks to our servers so we can send content to the right device.
We sometimes also collect information about the model and version of the device, browser and operating system you’re using; data about how you use the service and what you view; your device’s network and connections; your network and/or GPS location. We also collect unique IDs from your device – like randomly generated cookie IDs or your mobile device’s Ad ID (a value assigned by the operating system, which you can reset or limit). To collect this information, we use cookies and other tracking technologies. You can find more information about these technologies inSection 8of this policy.
Data we collect from social media services and other third parties : We may obtain information about you from other services, such as your publicly available profile or posts or, if you use a social media account to register or sign-in to our service, your social media provider will ask your permission to share account information with us to enable sign in. Any information we collect through these services will be treated in accordance with this policy.
Information we buy-in from data specialists : We may purchase data from specialist data resellers, including demographic information, publicly available information, purchase data and advertiser data.
2. HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION
We aim to use your information in ways that are fair and reasonable. Generally speaking, we and our service providers might use your information to:
Provide services and functionality you request from us; for example to create an account for you and to enable you to subscribe to our services
Personalise our services and our marketing; this will usually be based on your browsing and viewing behaviour, as well as any demographic information we hold about you
Send marketing to you, including content recommendations and special offers in accordance with your marketing preferences/choices
Provide technical support and send service messages; for example, to let you know if a new version of our app is available, or if there will be any maintenance carried out on the service
Invite you to participate in surveys, user testing and panels
Administer prize draws and competitions which you choose to enter – including publishing the names of winners, if required
Analyse your use of our services to help us to understand how the services are used and to improve them for everyone
Enforce our rights and terms of service
Prevent fraud or other potentially illegal activities (including copyright infringement)
Manage our email suppression lists.
Aggregate and/or Anonymised Information : We may aggregate or anonymise certain information that we collect from you. Aggregate and de-identified information is designed so that we can’t identify you personally.
We won’t sell or rent your data to others. We may share your information outside BritBox in the following circumstances:
Our service providers : We use a number of third parties to perform business functions on our behalf, such as sending our newsletters, hosting our online services and providing our customer services. We only disclose the information necessary to enable these third parties to perform their services. Our suppliers are contracted to comply with our instructions and we require that they don’t use your personal information for their own business purposes. For our Canadian users, our Data Protection Officer (whose contact information is provided inSection 11of this Policy), can provide further information about our policies and practices regarding service providers located outside of Canada and further information about how these service providers collect, use, disclose and store personal information on our behalf.
Payment partners : We use specialist payment partners to process your payment card information. In processing your payments, they may also use the data for fraud detection and prevention. They’re obliged to remain certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
Social media networks and other third parties : Generally we’ll only share your data with other third parties if you consent to this or ask us to share it.
We may also share information with these networks so we can market to you through their services and to help us to market to people with similar interests to you. For example, some services allow us to upload our customer list to match them to their users in a secure form – using a technology called hashing, which makes the data unreadable unless the other company has the same data. We require that all non-matches are securely deleted from their systems.
Regulatory bodies and others : We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies, government/regulatory bodies, internet service providers and content protection organisations as required or allowed by law. For example, if you post inappropriate or objectionable content on our services or where we reasonably believe you may be in breach of the law, we may report your content and behaviour to relevant parties.
Sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets : We reserve the right to transfer your personal information if we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets so the buyer can continue to offer you the services. In such circumstances, we’ll make reasonable efforts to give you advance notification of the transfer of your information.
4. WHERE WE’LL STORE AND USE YOUR INFORMATION
Your information will be processed in the United States and other locations globally, where it may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement.
As described in the previous section, we may share your information with related companies or with third party service providers and social networks. These companies may be located in, or use IT equipment located in, countries different to that in which your information is collected. Where this is the case, we’ll take steps to ensure your information receives an equivalent level of protection.
5. HOW LONG WE’LL KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
We’ll keep your information for as long as you use our services and for a period of time after you have stopped using the services for analysis and administrative purposes. We may keep an anonymised form of your account for a longer period, but it won’t be possible to link this data back to you.
Our payment partners will keep certain payment information for as long as required by law.

If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email toprivacy-us@britbox.com.

12. GLOSSARY: What are cookies and tracking technologies?
Websites and Apps you use, including this service, may use a combination of the following technologies:
Cookies, LSOs and HTML5 storage : These are distinct yet similar technologies which use small text files to store a randomly assigned ID and a website reference ID on your device to enable a website to ‘recognise’ it. They’re not usually used to store personal information. Some cookies will be deleted when you leave the website (session cookies) and others will persist so your device can be recognised and tracked over time – for example, for analytical purposes, to keep you signed in, or to remember media playback data. They may be set by the website you visit or by other companies providing services to/via that website (‘third party cookies’). Cookies can be controlled via your browser settings, and by using the opt-out tools. Be aware that opt-out tools work by setting an opt-out cookie, which tells the website not to track you. So if you then delete/clear your cookies you’ll delete the opt-out.
Tags, pixels and web beacons : These are all terms for pieces of code invisibly embedded in the webpage which transmit a reference code to enable websites and companies to track traffic and your interaction with a website, app or email. They’re often used in conjunction with cookies to see how you navigate the website. You can render them ineffective by opting out from the related cookies.
HTTP referrers : When you navigate to a website, the page you originated from or the URL you clicked on will be sent to the website. This is then logged and used to help understand more about your user journey, or to analyse the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
Device fingerprinting : Websites using this technology will collect a wide range of technical data about your device, browser and operating system which enables them to uniquely identify your device with high precision without relying on other technologies. This can therefore be used if you’ve set your browser to refuse cookies.
Software Development Kits (SDKs) : These are small programs contained within mobile apps to provide functionality. They’re generally used by mobile app developers to provide analytics and data about the use of an app, or to serve advertising. You can usually limit the reporting from the app settings, or by limiting or resetting the Ad ID in your device settings.
