Users from the European Economic Area
Legal Basis for Processing. If you are an individual resident in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable European Union laws. The legal basis depends on how you use the Site:
We need to collect and use the information to provide our services to you;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the services.
How to Access or Control Your Information – The General Data Protection Directive (“GDPR”) grants individuals residing in the EEA certain rights with respect to their information. These include the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. You can exercise these rights by contacting us at the address in the Contact Section below.
The GDPR provides that we may limit or deny your requests in certain cases. For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we have compelling legitimate interests to keep, including as required by law. You may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed if you have concerns about your rights.
Other International Users
The Site is hosted in the U.S. If you are a consumer accessing the Site from Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from U.S. laws, your continued use of the Site, which is governed by U.S. law and these terms, indicates your consent to transfer of your information to the U.S.
Children’s Privacy
Because protecting the privacy of young children is especially important, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from or about persons under 13 years of age. No part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on the Site without verified parental consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.
