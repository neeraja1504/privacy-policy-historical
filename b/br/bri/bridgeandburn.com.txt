Privacy Policy – Bridge & Burn
Online Ordering is Secure
We value our customers and want to make shopping online comfortable and safe. We take precautions to safeguard your financial information. Your credit card numbers are protected while in transit using the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption*. Moreover, your credit card information is encrypted when it is stored on our network, protecting it from theft or internal compromise. Furthermore, for added safety, if our customer service team suspects anything to be improper with your order and/or your credit card, they will contact you and get voice authorization from you.
SSL encryption ensures that your information is protected and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you begin the checkout process. Your web browser will indicate when you’re on a secure page. You also can verify that your information is encrypted by looking at the URL line of your browser. When visiting a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from http to https.
Alternate option.
If you are still concerned about using your credit card over the Internet you can just phone our Customer Service number and we will be glad to take your order.
