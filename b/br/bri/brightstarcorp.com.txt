- The Internet Protocol address and domain name used, but not the e-mail address.

- The web pages or services you accessed at this Site;
- The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site;

We will not add your name and e-mail address to such a list unless you affirmatively permit us to do so, that is, you have “opted-in.” You may also remove your name and e-mail address from a distribution list at any time by using the “unsubscribe” technique found in the e-mail message, that is, you may “opt-out” at any time. We will act on your opt-out promptly, but it may not be effective immediately die to normal processing delays.
5. Sharing with Third Parties
Except as outlined below in this Statement, we never provide your personal information to third parties without your consent.
We may provide personal information from a customer to a third party, including a Seller, as necessary to process that customer’s request or order or otherwise service a customer’s account.
We reserve the right to disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, and to protect our rights or property. This may include the exchange of information with other organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We reserve the right to use your e-mail or other address to send you important information relating to your account.
The Site may also contain optional surveys and questionnaires asking for information, as well as several opportunities for visitors to ask questions. We use the information you provide to help us design and build better products, to customize your shopping experience, and to provide advice and purchase recommendations. Taking part in any of these segments is always optional. We do not share the names and e-mail addresses of recipients of our distribution list or the results of our surveys and questionnaires with third parties, including Sellers.
We do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us when making a purchase, from surveys and from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our Users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis so as to prevent identification of personal information relating to any one individual. We may share this aggregated data with our Sellers and other business partners. In addition, we will share aggregated data with our Sellers in order to collect funds owed to us by the Sellers and in order to administer our relationships with those Sellers.
In addition, we may disclose information about you if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Brightstar or others.

7. Security
This Site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. The SSL protocol provides server authentication, data integrity, and privacy on the Web. SSL encrypts your personal and financial information as it is being transmitted, including credit card information, and also verifies the identity of the server and that the original message arrives at its destination.
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from this Site, and therefore you use this Site at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We also cannot be responsible for criminal acts of third parties, such as “hackers,” who may seek to compromise our security measures through unlawful means. Industry-accepted security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operation of the Site.

Brightstar recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”). Among other rules, the Directive generally requires “adequate protection” for the transfer of certain individually identifiable data from the EU to Brightstar operations in the United States. Brightstar accordingly adheres to the requirements of the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“EU Safe Harbor”) with respect to certain individually identifiable data received by Brightstar in the United States about (a) employees of its subsidiaries and affiliates in the EU (“European Employee Data”) and (b) individual customers and officers, directors, shareholders, owners, managers, employees, and other representatives of legal entity customers in the EU (“European Customer Representative Data”).
With respect to European Customer Representative Data, Brightstar and/or its affiliates may use and otherwise process such data in order to: perform obligations under its or its affiliates agreements with customers and carry out related business functions; and assure compliance with legal obligations and regulations applicable to Brightstar and its affiliates operating in the United States and around the world (“Brightstar Group”). Brightstar may also disclose European Customer Representative Data for these purposes to its affiliates, service providers and data processors, and regulatory, law enforcement, and other authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions where the Brightstar Group has operations where permitted by the EU Safe Harbor rules. In addition, Brightstar may disclose or otherwise process European Customer Representative Data in the context of any sale or transaction involving all or a portion of the business, or as may be required or permitted by law and/or the Safe Harbor.
With respect to European Employee Data, Brightstar and/or its affiliates provide covered employees in the EU with information regarding the data transfers that are covered by Safe Harbor via separate policies and procedures.
Individuals identified in European Customer Representative Data and European Employee Data may contact Brightstar’s Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below with questions and/or to review EU Personal Data that Brightstar holds about them. Employees may also contact their local human resources manager with any questions or concerns. Any such covered individual who cannot resolve his/her question directly with Brightstar or its affiliate can contact the local data protection authority for further information and assistance.
