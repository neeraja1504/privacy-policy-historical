Britain First – Taking our country back! | Privacy, refunds & unsubscribe policies
Britain First is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors. We believe you have the right to privacy on the web. We do not store credit card details nor do we share customer details with any 3rd parties. This policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.
1. What information do we collect?
We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:
(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views;
(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any contribution you make to us;
(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us e.g. your email address and other personal information when you sign up;
(d) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters; and

2. Do we use cookies?
The Britain First website uses “cookies” to help personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize britainfirst.org pages, or register with britainfirst.org site or services, a cookie helps britainfirst.org to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same britainfirst.org web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the britainfirst.org features that you customized.
We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html. Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the britainfirst.org services or other web sites you visit.
