The Archive and its Contents
39. British Pathé owns and/or controls an archive of historic importance. The images and metadata which make up the collection contain personally-identifiable information, including special categories of information such as race, of people both living and dead.
40. The collection also contains images and the personal information of individuals who were minors at the time the images were taken or when the metadata was written.
41. Personal information contained in the archive includes: Names, sex or gender, town/city address, ages, descriptions, race or ethnicity, personal appearance, political affiliation, trade union membership, and sexual orientation. Much of this information is not explicitly stated in the database but can be inferred from the images or their context.
42. The original purpose of image recording and metadata collection was for journalistic and artistic purposes. Much of this material was originally made available to the public via cinema newsreels.
43. The consent of individuals featured in this material is either implied by their participation in filming and photography, or consent was not required by the standards of the time in which the images were taken and/or data was collected, or for the purposes for which these activities were carried out.
44. We must weigh the rights of individuals against the damage caused to the integrity of the collection by hiding or deleting such data. We deem it to be in the public interest to retain and publish such information for the purposes of historical and sociological research, education, and journalism, as well as artistic and literary endeavours.
45. We make our archive free-to-view online for the benefit of the public and researchers. Through licensing agreements, we provide material for use by the public sector, museums, educational institutions, news organisations, documentary producers, and others. The archive is therefore actively used in historical and sociological research, education, and journalism, as well as in artistic and literary endeavours.
46. As a commercial licensing company, it is in our legitimate interest to accurately describe the items that are being sold and/or licensed by publishing or providing images of individuals, and of relevant information about individuals featured within its collection, to prospective customers and to make use of such material for marketing purposes.
47. As the copyright holder and/or controller of this material, we reserve the right to license and provide images and metadata related to the images from the collection to any customer, in any country, as permitted by law.
48. Third party clearance remains the responsibility of the licensees of British Pathé’s content under the standard terms and conditions of our licence agreements.
