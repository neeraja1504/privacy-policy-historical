Definitions
This Privacy Statement relates to information collected by Briefing.com, Inc. (referred to
in this statement as “Briefing,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) through your use of our website and
your direct contact with us.
“You” or “your” refers to the individual who uses this website, receives information from
us, or directly contacts us.
As used in this Privacy Statement, the terms "using" and "processing" information
include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other
analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to
collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and
transferring information within our organization.
Types of Information Collected
Briefing.com collects two types of information: “personal information” and “non-personal
information.”
1
“Personal information” identifies you or may be used in combination with other pieces of
personal information to identify you. Examples of personal information include your
name, company name, job title, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing
and credit card information. Personal information can also include information that does
not identify you but could be combined with other information in a way that enables you
to be identified. This includes information such as age, gender, profession, zip code, IP
address, and current location.
“Non-personal information” is information that cannot be used or combined with other
information to identify or contact you, including browser types, domain names, and
statistical data.
Sources of Information
Briefing.com collects information from the following types of individuals:
Visitors to our website and users of our website, who may have non-personal
information collected through cookies on our website. For more information on how
cookies work and how to disable them, see our Cookie Policy.
• Subscribers, and individuals who have expressed an interest in becoming
subscribers, whose personal information is collected by Briefing.com during the
signup process when voluntarily provided to us.
This policy first sets out how we collect, use, and store information obtained from
subscribers. It then sets out how we collect, use, and store information obtained from
visitors and users. Finally, we set out how information is shared and the rights you may
have in your information.
Collection and Use of Subscriber Information
Briefing.com collects personal information from subscribers when such information is
voluntarily provided to us, including through the Briefing.com registration process or
through direct contact with Briefing.com staff. This information is used to provide
subscribers with Briefing.com alerts, analysis, and promotional offers, or with support
services the subscriber has requested. Our practices are described in more detail
below.
Subscribers may also use cookies to enhance the functionality of the Briefing.com
website in a variety of ways, such as by allowing the Briefing.com website to remember
their login information. For more information on how cookies work and how to disable
them, please see our Cookie Policy.
Registration
Briefing.com’s free Investor service does not require registration of any kind. Any user is
free to access the Investor site without submitting any personal information.
2
Portions of the free Investor site require registration for access. We use the information
collected during the registration process to contact the registrant about services on our
site, including information provided as part of the subscription and special offers on
other Briefing.com services.
When signing up for premium services from Briefing.com, we ask for contact information
(such as name, email, and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit
card number and expiration date). This information is used to provide subscribers with
the requested services and for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order,
the information is used to contact the subscriber.
Communications from the Site
Special Offers and Updates
Out of respect for the privacy of our subscribers, we present the option to not receive
these types of communications. Please see the Account Settings sections of your
particular subscription for more information.
Newsletter
If a subscriber wishes to receive our newsletters, they must opt-in to receive them. In
order to provide our newsletters to subscribers who opt-in, we ask for contact
information, such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users’ privacy we
also provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Account
Settings sections of your particular subscription for more information.
Service Announcements
We send out service-related emails when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if we’re
experiencing technical difficulties or have implemented new enhancements to our
service, we may send an email notification. Generally, subscribers may not opt-out of
these communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel
your account.
Customer Service
We send all new subscribers a confirmation email to verify their password and
username after registration. We also communicate with subscribers on a regular basis
to provide requested services as well as to notify subscribers of issues relating to their
account. We reply to communications from subscribers via email or phone, in
accordance with the user's preferences. Generally, users may not opt-out of these
communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your
account.
We also may contact subscribers or potential subscribers via email who have not
checked out, not completed registration, or abandoned forms to follow up and see if
there was problem with the process. You may opt-out of these communications at any
time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

Storage of Subscriber information
Briefing.com stores information it collects from subscribers for as long as the
subscriber’s account is active. Credit card information is not stored by Briefing.com at
any time. Credit card information is stored and processed by a third party. We may also
retain subscriber information after a subscriber deactivates their account as necessary
to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. We generally retain such information
for five years to facilitate reactivation of subscriber accounts. If you would like your
information to be deleted earlier, please contact Travis Rath at cpo@briefing.com.
Collection and Use of Visitor Information
We collect information from visitors to the Briefing.com website through the use of log
files, clear gifs, and cookies. In some cases, these technologies are provided by third
parties. This information is typically used for statistical analysis of our visitors, rather
than being used in a way that links the information collected with you individually.
If you are a subscriber, some information collected by these technologies may be
associated with your account to create a profile of your overall preferences when using
our site. This profile is used only by Briefing.com to help us improve your experience
with the Briefing.com website.
More detail is provided on our collection and use of visitor information in the sections
that follow.

companies will only use personal information for the purposes described in this section.

level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
features or areas of our site may be limited. For more information about how cookies

analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather
broad demographic information for aggregate use.

personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that
such action is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, current judicial proceeding,
court order, or legally binding request served on our Website.

In the event Briefing.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being
acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, subscriber personal
information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Subscribers will be
notified via prominent notice on our Website for 30 days prior to a change of ownership
or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, personal
information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection,
subscribers will be given a choice consistent with our “Notification of Changes” section.
