3. ONLINE LICENSE VALIDATION
To fight piracy, some products may contain online license validation. As many man-hours have been put into creating the wonderful products you are using, it is sad that there are people who don't respect that and use illegal methods to create their own license.
At Brivium, we think that as a paying customer, you won't mind this validation, as it prevents others to enjoy the same applications for free while you paid for it.
Online license validation works by sending your Forum URL, no additional or personal information will be sent. After sending the Forum URL to Brivium, the application will receive an answer from server that indicates whether the license was purchased at Brivium or not.
If the application determines the license wasn't purchased at Brivium it will unable to install the product, at that point no additional information will be sent to Brivium. If your license could be validated online (which will be the case if you purchases your license at Brivium) your product will be installed and the validation succeeded.
All products updated after 13 Sep 2014 will contain online license validation technology & afftected with this privacy policy.
