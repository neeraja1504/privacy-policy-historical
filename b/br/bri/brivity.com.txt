Your privacy is critically important to us. At Brivity we have a few fundamental principles
You own your data
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Personally-Identifying Information is any information that that identifies you or would enable someone to contact you.   We collect Personally-Identifying Information when you register to use our Services (see Terms of Service), ask a question, conduct a transaction, or send us an email.  If you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some or all of our Services.
Like most website operators, Brivity collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  Brivity’s purpose for collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Brivity’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Brivity may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Brivity routinely collects certain types of Personally-Identifying Information, like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to identify its visitors, however, we do not disclose such information, other than under the circumstances described in this policy.
Certain visitors to Brivity’s websites choose to interact with Brivity in ways that require Brivity to gather Personally-Identifying Information.  The amount and type of information that Brivity gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with Brivity by purchasing services from Brivity, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.  In each case, Brivity collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Brivity. Brivity does not disclose Personally-Identifying Information other than as described in this policy. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities or services.
Protection of Personally-Identifying Information
Brivity uses physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personally-Identifying Information.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect against malware, viruses, and spyware on our site or as part of the Service.  By using Brivity’s websites or Services you agree to release Brivity from any liability associated with any technical issues caused by the Service, including any malware, viruses, or spyware communicated to your computer or mobile device through any use of the Service.
Wherever we collect sensitive financial information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way
Brivity takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access to its email lists
Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information
Brivity will not rent or sell Personally-Identifying Information to anyone.
Brivity discloses Personally-Identifying Information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that: (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Brivity’s behalf or to provide services available at Brivity’s websites, and (ii) that have contractually agreed not to disclose it to others.  Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Brivity’s websites or Services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Brivity discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Brivity believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or security of Brivity, third parties, or the public at large.
We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personally-Identifying Information.
As Brivity continues to grow, we may buy or sell businesses or assets.  If all or substantially all of Brivity’s business or assets are acquired by a third party, our users’ Personally-Identifying Information will generally be one of the transferred business assets.  We reserve the right to include your Personally-Identifying Information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.
