Online Security
Briscoe Group utilises a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.  All user contact information is contained behind a firewall and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights.  As an added safeguard, Briscoe Group does not store credit card information.
We take website and credit card security extremely seriously and always endeavour to provide a secure, safe platform from which to conduct online transactions.  We use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts information as it is transmitted over the internet.  This encryption scrambles details such as credit card numbers and personal information, so that other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security.
However, please note that whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure.  Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data that you transfer over the internet to us.
If you are using a computer or terminal in a public location, we recommend that you always log out and close the website browser when you complete an online session for your security.  In addition, we recommend that you take the following security measures to enhance your online safety:
Keep your account passwords private.  Remember, anybody who knows your password may access your account.
When creating a password, use at least 8 characters.  A combination of letters and numbers is best.  We also recommend that you frequently change your password.  You can do this by going to ‘My Account’ and clicking ‘Change your password’.

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information held by us is accurate and up-to-date. You are entitled to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we hold personal information about you and you are entitled to reasonable access to this information. You may also request:
