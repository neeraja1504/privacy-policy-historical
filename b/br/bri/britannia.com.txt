Consumer Information
During the process of delivering content and advertising to you, Britannia does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, if you register for our email newsletter/bulletin, or enter our sweepstakes, you knowingly provide us with your email address, name, age, residence, hobbies, surfing habits, etc. This information will not be sold to list brokers or used for any purpose other than to deliver to you information you have requested or information pertaining to interests you may have indicated.

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, an ad service may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by advertisers to respond to your request. In addition, ad services may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.
