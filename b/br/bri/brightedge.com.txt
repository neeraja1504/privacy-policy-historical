9. Your Personal Information Rights
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, the EU GDPR, and other applicable privacy laws, you have the right to:
Know what Personal Information BrightEdge has about you;
Ensure your Personal Information is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which BrightEdge collected it;
Make your Personal Information portable to another data controller;
Withdraw your consent to BrightEdge processing your Personal Information; and
Have your Personal Information erased.
If you would like to review, correct, receive a copy of, or erase the Personal Information we have about you or withdraw your processing consent, please send us your request using the “Contact Information” below.  Unless a legal exemption applies, we will respond to all such requests within thirty (30) days.  If we refuse your request, we will notify you of our reasons for the refusal to the extent required and how you may complain about the refusal.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and to specify the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or erased before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive and vexatious, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.  However, we will not charge you for the making of the request or to correct, update, or erase your Personal Information.
10. Data Retention, Storage, and Security
We hold your Personal Information in a combination of hard copy and electronic files for the period necessary to support the Site, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or otherwise fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  We do not always remove or delete all of your non-personally identifiable account information for a number of reasons including due to technical and systems constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.
The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information.  We have implemented information security best practices throughout our organization, and we are ISO 27001 certified.  When you enter confidential information (such as your password), we may encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL-encryption).  To learn more about such technology, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage, or other data security methods are one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee the security of the information you provide.
If BrightEdge learns of a security breach that may affect your data, we will notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  We may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues related to your use of the Site.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  If you are a EU resident, you will receive, without undue delay, a Personal Information breach notification if such breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, or as otherwise required under EU GDPR.  To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) please email privacy@brightedge.com.
**11. Children’s Information  **
This Site is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 nor does BrightEdge knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13.  In the event we confirm that we have collected Personal Information from someone under the age of 13, we will delete that information.  If you believe we have any information from a child under 13, please contact us using the contact details in “Contact Information” below.
12.Third Party Sites
The Site may also contain links to third party websites.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by BrightEdge.  Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.  If you submit Personal Information to any third party site, your information is governed by that site’s privacy policy.  We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such websites to determine how they handle any information separately collected from you.  Please be aware that we do not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Site.
