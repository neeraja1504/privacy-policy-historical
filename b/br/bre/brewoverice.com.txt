Privacy Policy - Green Mountain Coffee
We at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters take your privacy concerns very seriously. This our privacy policy, spelled out in plain English. We hope it answers any questions you might have, and that you'll return often to visit and shop with us.
What We Collect
When you purchase a product from GreenMountainCoffee.com, we ask you to provide information required to fulfill your order. We do not require you to create an account to place an order... you may place an order as a Guest. You will need to provide your name, email address, phone, shipping address, and billing address in order to process an order. Additionally, should you create an account with us, we'll also require you to create a username and password.
What We Do With What We Collect
As a GreenMountianCoffee.com customer, your email address and phone number will never be rented, sold, or provided to a third party. Occasionally, we make special offers available to our customers -- promotions, sales, events, discounts, etc. You may periodically receive e-mail notification from us regarding these special events and offers. If you do not want to receive e-mail notification from us concerning special promotions, savings, events or other important information, simply use the "unsubscribe" link found in the footer of the email to change your preferences. Should you have questions about how we use your information, feel free to send us a message by visiting the Contact Us section of this Web site.
As you may know, we produce and mail a catalog several times each year. We send this catalog to many of our online customers because we'd like you to be aware of all the great new products that become available each season. If you would prefer not to ever receive catalog mailings from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, please visit the Contact Us section of this Web site and indicate that you would like to be removed from our mailing list.
In keeping with common mail-order catalog practices, we occasionally participate in cooperative postal address list-sharing programs with similar carefully-screened companies that we believe might be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to ever receive such catalog mailings, please visit the Contact Us section of this Web site and indicate that you prefer not to have us share your postal mailing address with our partners. Alternatively, you can contact us at 1-888-TRY-GMCR (879-4627), and speak directly with a Customer Care representative who can update your account.
We also regularly aggregate our sales and market information based on our customers' purchases. We use this information to be certain that we are offering the right products at the right time. We like to understand what regions of the country buy more products from us, what products are the most popular, and generally how our business is doing. At no time is any personally identifiable information made available in these market aggregates.
At no time will we ever release your credit card information to anyone!
