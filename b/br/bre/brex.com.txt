1. Data That Brex Collects
General. We collect Usage Data when you use the Services or our website. Collection of specific Usage Data depends on the manner in which you engage with our website and the Services. For example, we collect Usage Data when you visit our website (such as the IP address or browser type) or provide Personal Data to us through our website (such as providing us your name, email address, or phone number); and we collect transactional information when you access or use, or attempt to access or use the Services (such as using a Card to make a purchase). Usage Data may be personal to you or your Card, while other data may be provided to us by payment networks or other third parties. Collection of Usage Data is described in more detail below.
Visiting Our Websites. We collect Usage Data when you visit our website through the use of cookies or web beacons (also called pixel tags), through your browser, or through other web technologies. This Usage Data may include how much time you spend on particular pages, your preferences or selections on our website, or other data related to your interaction with our websites. Usage Data collected through our website helps us understand your preferences and improve our Services. You may limit our collection of this Usage Data through your browser settings, however doing so may affect or limit the features of the Services available to you.

Using the Services. Our Services are contracted for by Companies for use exclusively by Employees. We collect Personal Data from Employees who control or open the Brex Account for the Company, and on specific Employees who will be using the Services (such as collecting the name, email address, or phone number of an Employee who will be issued a Card). Where you do not provide Personal Data when required—or where if it is inaccurate, out-of-date, or unable to be validated—we may prohibit your or Company’s use of the Services.
2. How We Use Data
Improving Our Website, Products, and Services. We will use Personal Data and Usage Data to improve usability of our website and the Services, and to offer other Services we believe may be of interest to you.

Providing the Services. We will use Personal Data to provide the Services the Company or its Employees request from us. This may require us to share Personal Data with third parties to complete or evaluate the risk of transactions initiated using products or services we provide. We may also share Personal Data with Third-Party Service Providers as directed by a Company or Employees.
Understanding Usage of the Services and Fraud Detection. We will use Personal Data and Usage Data to understand how Company or Employees are using the Services, and use this data to improve or change user experience.

Reporting, Analyzing Performance, and Auditing. We or Third-Party Service Providers acting on our behalf will use Personal Data and Usage Data for reporting, analyzing performance, and performing audits that may be limited to specific Personal Data or Usage Data, or that may be aggregated.

3. Sharing Data
We share Personal Data with Third-Party Service Providers or as requested by a Company or its Employees. We also share Personal Data with regulators, law enforcement, financial services providers, or other authorized third parties as required by law.
We may reasonably transform Personal Data into De-identified Data by anonymizing it or by aggregating or combining it with other data to mask its relation to particular individuals. De-Identified Data is no longer Personal Data and we may use De-Identified Data and share it publicly or with third parties without your permission.
We may add or change how or when we use affiliates or third parties to process Personal Data without notifying you, except that any use of Personal Data will be consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Employee Personal Data provided by a Company or its Employees will be maintained by Brex consistent with our practices and as required by law or the agreements we maintain with third-party service providers. When using certain products or services, the Company will need to formally close its Brex Account and satisfy any outstanding obligations owed to us before an Employee can fully revoke consent to our use of Personal Data. Brex, its affiliates, and its service providers may retain Personal Data to comply with governmental reporting obligations and other legal or regulatory requirements.
5. International Users and Personal Data Export
