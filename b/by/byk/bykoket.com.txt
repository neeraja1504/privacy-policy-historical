How long will we keep your information?
We will keep your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with us) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.
If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms and Conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account, or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.
Where we are permitted to send you direct marketing communications we may retain your contact information necessary for this purpose, (if you have consented to receiving them) for as long as you do not unsubscribe from receiving the same from us.
Security
The security of your Personal Information is important to us but, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information.
