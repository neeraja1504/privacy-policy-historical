Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 % secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your personal information Bureau Veritas cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
Bureau Veritas' policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Bureau Veritas' control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
