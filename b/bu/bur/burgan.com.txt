Privacy
​​​Protecting your privacy, along with your financial assets, is at the core of our business. You have chosen to do business with us, and we recognize our obligation to keep the information you provide to us secure and confidential.
Our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the principles and online guidelines described below.
Keeping your information secure
Keeping your financial information secure is one of our most important responsibilities. We value your trust and handle your information with care. Our employees access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs. We may also access information about you when considering a request from you for additional services or when exercising our rights under the law or any agreement with you.
​​ We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures, and we continually assess new technology for protecting information. Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.
Consolidation Sites
Please use caution when using consolidation sites. Consolidation sites are Internet sites which offer the ability to collect all of your personal information on one site. For example, you may be encouraged to provide consolidation sites your personal finance information, such as your Online ID, Access ID, PC Password or Online Pass code for Online Banking. NEVER PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO A SITE THAT YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE AND FULLY TRUST.
Burgan Bank is committed to making sure that your Online Banking is safe and secure. With our own security infrastructure in place, we are confident that access to your accounts is private and secure; we are unable to provide similar assurances for other websites. While Burgan Bank works to protect your banking privacy, you also play a role in protecting your accounts. Only provide your Access ID or Online ID when your browser shows a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection directly to the Burgan Bank website or to another site you have investigated and fully trust.
Other
Information may also be exchanged with credit bureaus and similar organizations, provided when legally required or permitted, or in connection with a fraud investigation, an acquisition or the sale of your account to another financial institution.
If we receive a subpoena or similar legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will generally attempt to notify you (unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so). Except as required by law or as described above, we do not share information with other parties, including government agencies.
Certain information, such as trust and fiduciary information, is subject to very strict limitations regarding the sharing of information, both internally and externally.
** Online Privacy Guidelines**
Protecting information online
Whether you are a current customer or just visiting us online, we safeguard the information you provide to us at www.burgan.com How we use and protect this information is described below.
Protecting online applications
When you apply online for accounts or services, or enroll in online banking, you provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your application. To ensure that your application remains confidential, the information is sent to us in a "secure session" established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
After you have submitted your application online, we recommend that you end your browser session before leaving your computer.
We, along with the outside companies with which we work, if applicable, may keep the information you provide to us, along with information we collect from outside sources, so that we can offer you accounts and services related to your financial needs.
How we handle e-mail
We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have.
Regular non-encrypted Internet e-mail is not secure. In the instances where Burgan Bank Internet e-mail addresses are provided, these are provided for information inquiries of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature.
Protecting your privacy online
Whenever we ask for personal information on our web site, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology) for transferring data. This technology encrypts - or scrambles - your account information so it's virtually impossible for anyone other than Burgan Bank to read it.
Count on our commitment to your privacy
You can count on us to keep you informed about how we protect your privacy and limit the sharing of information you provide to us - whether it's at a banking center, over the phone or through the Internet.
Please note that since we cannot control information on other Internet sites, we are not responsible for the content of sites linked from www.Burgan.com.
