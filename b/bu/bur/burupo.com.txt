When you leave a comment to a post , the website asks you to fill in your name and email. These fields are optional: you can skip them. Your comment will still be published.
I also use Google Analytics. You can learn more about the data collected by Google Analytics here.

And I never transmit personal data to any third party except in the following cases:
Emailing plugin MailPoet, which I use to automate my mailings.
Google Analytics, which I use to analyze traffic to this website.
Situations, when disclosure is required by law.
All personal information is stored at the server of my hosting provider. And Google stores the data collected by Google Analytics.
I take all the reasonable precautions to protect personal data from any unauthorized use (for example: strong passwords, reliable hosting provider, regular antivirus checking).
