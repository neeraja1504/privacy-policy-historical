Our Secure Ordering.
BulkNutrition.com uses Secured Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the privacy of your personal information. When you make an online purchase, our advanced security technology encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card number) before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than us (BulkNutrition.com) to read it. To further protect your information, we utilize state of the art back-end systems and restrict employee access to your information. Unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.
Credit Card Fraud Protection.
All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. We will protect you for this $50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company and the credit card company charges you the $50 deductible without offset.
Optional Phone Ordering.
If you are still skeptical about placing your order online, you may place your order over the phone at (484) 668-1581 during customer service hours: Monday through Friday from 8am-6pm ET.
On-line ordering is available to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
