6.  Cookies
"Cookies" are small data files stored on your computer's hard drive. Like most websites, we use cookies provide you with a personalized and enhanced online experience by actions such as remembering your preferences, tracking advertisements, and remembering your shopping cart items.  For these reasons, you need to enable cookies in your browser to have full use of our Site. If you choose not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use certain features of the Site.
Like many other websites, we use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other technologies on our Site to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions. In particular, we may use third-party advertising services on our Site, such as Google AdSense, for purposes such as:
Remarketing with Google AdSense;
Google Display Network Impression Reporting; and
Demographics and Interests Reporting
To learn more about the DoubleClick cookie, including how to uninstall it, please visit https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090?hl=en.
Our website may use services that track a user’s browsing not only within Bulbhead.com but also across other websites. Those services do not collect the Identifying Information as defined above, although they may make use of persistent identifiers that could allow particular content or advertising to be presented to a particular User.
Some browsers send so-called “Do Not Track” signals to websites such as ours. Our Site currently does not honor such indications due to a lack of industry consensus as to how such signals should be handled.
7.  Third Party Websites
BulbHead may post links to third-party websites on its Site.  We have no control over these third-party websites, and those third-party websites have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third-party links.
SEE SECTION 15 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 7.
8.  Third Party Access to Your Information
We use other companies to provide support to our Site and our Services, and we may need to share information about you with these companies, or they may collect it directly, so that they can provide their services to us and ultimately to you. For example, our web hosting service stores the personal information that you provide us, and we use a logistics company to handle order processing and shipments. Our contracts with those companies prohibit those companies from making use of your personal information for any purpose other than to assist our Site and Service. In some cases, those companies may allow subcontractors to access personal information of BulbHead.com users for the purpose of providing their services to us.
A third-party payment processor, such as PayPal, handles payments. By making a purchase on the Site, you authorize us to collect, share, and otherwise use your information in conjunction with our payment processor. Our payment processor stores all credit-card information; BulbHead itself does not retain credit card numbers.
We do not rent or sell the personal information of our Users with non-affiliated third parties for their own use. We may share such personal information with our parent company, Telebrands, and other companies similarly under Telebrands’ ownership or control.
SEE SECTION 15 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 8.
9.  Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes
At times BulbHead may be required by law to release personal information in response to a legal request from a government agency or a private litigant. If we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may try to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either, and in certain cases we may be prohibited from notifying you.  We also reserve the right to report you, and release personal information about you to, law enforcement or other appropriate third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.
SEE SECTION 15 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 9.

In all such cases, our arrangements with any non-U.S. service providers prohibit them from using personal data for any purpose other than to provide support to our Site and Services.
