**Access to Personal Data Controlled by our Customers
Bullhorn acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal data and to withdraw consent to the use/processing of your personal data. In most cases, Bullhorn has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes for customers. We recommend that an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, delete or receive a copy of personal data should direct his/her query to the Bullhorn customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data by our customer, we will respond within 30 days or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Individuals may also submit such inquiries or requests directly to Bullhorn at no cost for them by contacting privacy@bullhorn.com.
**Data Retention by Bullhorn
We will retain personal data for as long as a customer’s account is active or as needed to provide the Service to our customer, as required under customer agreements and / or for as long as Bullhorn needs the personal data to fulfill the purposes for which the Company initially collected it, unless otherwise required by applicable law or court order. We will also retain this personal data as necessary to comply with our legal and/or contractual obligations, comply with court orders, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When the purpose for which Bullhorn is processing the personal data is fulfilled, expires or is terminated, Bullhorn will either delete or anonymize/de-identify any personal data in accordance with our customer agreements, this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In the event we cannot delete or anonymize/de-identify your personal data, we will inform you of the reasons, subject to any legal restrictions.
**Data Security
Bullhorn employs reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the personal data it processes. When the Service is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 8.0 or higher, Transport Layer Security (TSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help provide that personal data is safe, and secure while in transit. Bullhorn also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Service in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to protect against interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Bullhorn provides individual usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help protect against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and provide for the appropriate use of personal data. Nevertheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent (100%) secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Service, please contact us at privacy@bullhorn.com.
**Links to Third Party Sites
Our Service includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those at www.bullhornstaffing.com and https://bbo.bullhornstaffing.com. If you submit personal data to any of these sites, your information is governed by the applicable third-party’s privacy policies and we are not responsible for it. We therefore encourage you to carefully read any notices provided through a hyperlink and the privacy policy of any Web site you visit and raise questions directly with these other providers.
**No Services for Minors
We do not knowingly collect information from minors. To use the Site, you must be the age of legal majority in your place of residence. By using the Site, you hereby represent that you are at least the age of legal majority in your place of residence. We do not use an application or other mechanism to determine the age of users of the Site.  All information provided to us will be treated as if it was provided by an adult. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete information associated with a minor as soon as practicable if we learn that a minor has submitted information about himself/herself to us.
**Note for California Residents
California law permits California residents who provide us with personal data to request certain information regarding our disclosure of such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not, at this time, disclose such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If we change this policy, we will update this provision and provide instructions on how you may make a request for details
**Do-Not-Track Disclosure
There are many methods where web browser signals and similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking. But we may not be aware of or able to honor every such mechanism. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals other than cookies, we may not respond to undefined DNT signals to our Sites or online services. More information about “do not track” is available at www.allaboutdnt.org concerning such information.
**Severability
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Privacy Policy in any country shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect.
**Changes in this Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices that will become effective upon posting. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice through the Service prior to the change becoming effective.
