Customer Service
When you visit any Web site, your computer exchanges information with other computers. Except for information or commands you enter yourself, most of this process eliminates your need to enter numerous technical codes. That's what makes the Bulbs.com experience so user friendly. We assure your privacy by supporting your right to decide what information you share and how it is used!
At Bulbs.com, we take security very seriously. All of our employees have reviewed our privacy policy and must log in to a secure administration site with an username and password to view any customer/sales information. A Bulbs.com technical team checks our security monthly, so you can rest assured that your information is private. For transferring sensitive information such as credit card accounts, we rely on Verisign secure encryption technology.
If this policy is ever changed, all users will be notified via email of the changes.

Enter your e-mail address.
Choose and confirm a password
At any point while you’re browsing, you can select an item to be added to your customer account. When you are done browsing, you can review your selected products by clicking on the shopping cart icon at the top right corner of your screen, or clicking the Checkout button in the mini-shopping cart that pops up when you add an item or hover your mouse over the shopping cart icon.
This takes you to a screen showing your full shopping cart. At this step, you may update product quantities and/or add a promotional code if you have one. Click Secure Checkout and follow instructions to enter your billing and shipping information, as well as a preferred contact phone number in case we need to get in touch with you about your order. In your final steps, you will be asked to select your preferred shipping method and the following screen offers options for payment: you can enter credit card information, complete your transaction using PayPal™ or you can opt to contact us by e-mail or phone about paying by (Check, Money Order, Purchase Order) and to process your order.

The information gathered as part of your purchasing is used only to process your purchase. The only information that is ever shared with anyone is:

Your name/company, the contents of your order, and transaction number with our distributor
Shipping information, with the shipper.
When you log onto the Internet, your computer connects to your Internet service, declaring its online presence by requesting an IP (Internet protocol) address-- sort of like asking for an assigned seat in an electronic classroom. Your Internet service's computer responds by placing you at a particular set for the session. Some providers assign you a permanent or "static" IP address, but most use temporary ones. This helps assure your privacy, because it's difficult-to-impossible to collect personal information about you via a temporary address.
Our Web site reads visitors' IP addresses but does not keep a list or store them anywhere. This gives us broad, generic information such as how many AOL® users log onto Bulbs.com, and it helps us maintain Bulbs.com's compatibility with many different Internet services.
Bulbs.com records browser types and versions so we can answer questions such as, "How many of our visitors were using Internet Explorer 4.0® last month?" That tells us what portions of our Web site visitors can and cannot use, motivating us to keep our Web site up to date.
We record how many people visit each page on our Web site. This helps answer questions such as, "What items or pages are drawing a lot of interest this month?"
We may also record which Web site or search engine referred you to Bulbs.com. This information enhances your shopping experience by making images look better, allowing pages to load more quickly and ensures Bulbs.com remains compatible with more browsers and systems.
When you visit Bulbs.com, we send you back a cookie - a list of data that enhances your shopping convenience. This information is only available to be sent back to the computer that sent it to you so that you can create a list of those items you are purchasing.
Bulbs.com uses Google AdWords Conversion Tracking &8212; an analytics service provided by Google that tells us how many customers click on our Google Ads and proceed to place an order on the website. This is similar to your regular customer shopping experience on the website, but in this case a cookie is only placed when you click on a Google Ad. This cookie expires in 30 days and does not identify personal information about the customer. The cookie provides conversion data as it related to the Google ad that was clicked &8212; allowing Bulbs.com to provide a better website experience to its customers. Users who do not want to participate in this tracking can easily disable the Google conversion tracking cookie on their Internet browser via the user settings. See the Google Privacy Policy for more information about conversion tracking and the ability to opt out.
