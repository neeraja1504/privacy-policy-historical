Button Poetry Privacy Policy - Button Poetry
The short version
GDPR Note
We are in the process of updating our website policies and procedures in conjunction with GDPR. As a small, US-based company, we are striving to better serve our EU visitors and customers. If you have any specific concerns about our website in this regard, please contact us at support@buttonpoetry.com and we will do our best to resolve them swiftly.
For now, please know that to help poets reach a wide audience we use industry-standard tracking scripts from Google and Facebook. We also use some on-site cookies to operate our online shop and ask for information to process orders and respond to inquiries.
Below we have a more technical policy to meet legal requirements, but the gist is this: to do business on the internet Button Poetry uses cookies on our website, which makes our online shopping cart function and lets us see how people use the website so we can keep improving it. We also collect information about your visit and directly from you when you place orders or sign up to our newsletter. We also have ads, and once you click on an ad and leave our website our privacy policy no longer applies. We do not share your personal information with others, and protect what information you share with us as if it was our own.
This privacy policy is an evolving document and has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our website.

What we share with others / Where we send your data
Marketing Analytics
On behalf of our authors, we use industry standard marketing and analytics techniques provided by Google and Facebook. Here is a summary of those and their privacy policies:
Google Analytics and Adwords: We insert Google’s scripts to display ads and collect site usage statistics. Google collects IP addresses to help us understand where visitors are coming from, which pages they view, and how long they visit for. These data are stored and processed on Google’s servers. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on. You can view Google’s privacy policy at: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Facebook Pixel: We insert Facebook’s scripts which help us measure conversions from Facebook ads to our products. This can include information such as your IP address and anonymized demographic and location information to help us understand our audience. You can view Facebook’s privacy policy at: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
Outside of marketing and site usage statistics, we do not share your data except in instances necessary to do our business, such as providing names and addresses to shipping providers for delivering physical goods. We do not provide such third party any permissions to use or retain such data outside of the scope of fulfilling your order or supporting you.
Payments
We accept payments through PayPal and by Credit Card via our credit card processor, Authorize.net. When processing payments, some of your data will be passed to Authorize.net or Paypal depending on your chosen payment, including information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and billing information.
Please see the Authorize.net Privacy Policy and PayPal Privacy Policy for more details.
How long we retain your data
We generally store information about you for as long as we need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we will store order information for at least 7 years for tax and accounting purposes following industry recommendations. This includes your name, email address and billing and shipping addresses.
If you leave a comment or review, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For customers that register on our website, we will store your name, address, email and phone number, which will be used to populate the checkout for future orders. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Your contact information
For any inquiries about your privacy on our website, please email support@buttonpoetry.com.
Additional information
How we protect your data
Button Poetry staff take your privacy very seriously, and never share your data outside of the company except where it is required to fulfill orders and provide support you ask for. We use secure company email addresses, have premium secure web hosting, and keep our technologies up to date to lower the chance of a breach or exposure of customer’s private data.
What data breach procedures we have in place
In the unlikely event of a data breach we will report the breach and announce any theft of data with all relevant information on our website, our social media channels such as Facebook, and through our opt-in mailing lists. We will disclose, unless advised otherwise by law enforcement, what kind of information was lost and to whom.
