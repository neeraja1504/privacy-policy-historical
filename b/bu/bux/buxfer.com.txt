What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Buxfer’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Buxfer gathers when you are accessing buxfer.com and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Buxfer does not own or control, or to individuals that Buxfer does not employ or manage.

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through buxfer.com.

We collect the following types of information from our users.
Personal Information You Provide to Us
We receive and store any information you enter on buxfer.com or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, age, gender, zip code, e-mail address, cell phone number, occupation, hometown, college, personal interests, nickname, and information about personal finances that is entered on buxfer.com. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.

We also record the details of your transactions on buxfer.com.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Buxfer only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of buxfer.com or services so that we can make buxfer.com appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and buxfer.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Buxfer never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
E-mail Communications
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Buxfer if your computer supports this type of program. Buxfer uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
