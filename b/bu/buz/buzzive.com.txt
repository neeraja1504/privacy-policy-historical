Privacy Policy - Buzzive.com
BUZZIVE operates one websites. It is BUZZIVE’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, BUZZIVE collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browsertype, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BUZZIVE’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BUZZIVE’s visitors use its website. From time to time, BUZZIVE may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
BUZZIVE also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. BUZZIVE only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to BUZZIVE’s websites choose to interact with BUZZIVE in ways that require BUZZIVE to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BUZZIVE gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at BUZZIVE.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with BUZZIVE – by purchasing access to our service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, BUZZIVE collects such informationonly insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with BUZZIVE. BUZZIVE does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
BUZZIVE may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. BUZZIVE may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, BUZZIVE does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
BUZZIVE discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BUZZIVE’s behalf or to provide services available at BUZZIVE’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using BUZZIVE’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BUZZIVE will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, BUZZIVE discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BUZZIVE believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BUZZIVE, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an BUZZIVE website and have supplied your email address, BUZZIVE may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with BUZZIVE and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order tohelp us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. BUZZIVE takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorizedaccess, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
