Privacy Policy
Last updated November 3, 2011
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of Twelvefold Media Inc. (“Twelvefold Media”) at its website located at twelvefold.com (the “Website”) and at Twelvefold Media’s Partner Websites. Twelvefold Media is a California corporation and is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.
1. Websites We Collect Information From
Twelvefold Media is an on-line media company that partners with various websites and advertisers to serve targeted contextual advertisements to end users visiting its partner websites (“Partner Websites). We collect information on our Website and from our Partner Websites as described in this Privacy Policy.
2. Types of Information Collected
We collect two types of information about our Website Users and users of our Partner Websites: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, and telephone number. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
3. Partner Websites
Twelvefold Media’s Spectrum Technology is an ad serving platform centered on emotive-based advertising that uses content at the website page level to deliver relevant advertisements to end users visiting our Partner Websites. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from end users visiting our Partner Websites. We do collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from end users visiting our Partner Websites using technologies including “cookies” and “pixel tags”. Importantly, we do not use the collected information to serve targeted advertisements. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected from our Partner Websites to provide services to end users visiting our Partner Websites, enhance the operation of our ad serving, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Partner Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor end user experiences with our Partner Websites.
Our Partner Websites and Advertisers may separately collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information or other information from end users who visit our Partner Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of our Partner Websites and Advertisers, and we are not responsible for their collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information or other information from end users.
To learn how to opt-out of data collection and preference based advertising programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
4. Our Website
We collect both Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information from End Users on our Website.
Personally Identifiable Information. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as requesting information about our services, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, and telephone number. If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested services.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Item 7 of this Privacy Policy.
5. Use of Data Collected from Our Website
Personally Identifiable Information. We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide services to you, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name, we will obtain consent from you to post your name along with your comment prior to posting your comment for public view. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and described in Item 6 below.
6. Release of Personally Identifiable Information
We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:
We may share your information with Third Party Service Providers. We may utilize third parties to provide us with specific services. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails and collecting and analyzing data on the Website. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Third Party Service Providers to send postal or email, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. Our Third Party Service Providers are contractually prohibited from disclosing this information to any third party.
We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.
7. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Non-Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:
We use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable Information usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. For example, we currently use Google Analytics to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from Users of our Website. Google Analytics uses Cookies and records IP addresses to help us understand better how people are using our Website. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by following the instructions under “Browser Opt-out” located at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
8. Updating and Correcting Information
We currently do not have a method for completely deleting user information from our database. However, deleting the cookie stored on your computer will cause you to be perceived as a new user with no known user data. You may also change a setting in your browser, instructing it not to accept cookies, but this could prevent you from receiving some Twelvefold Media services.
9. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information through our Website, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website. With regard to our Partner Websites, you may “opt-out” as described above in Items 3 and 7.
We may send you promotional emails which advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our advertisers and affiliates. If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails.
10. Security of Information
We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
11. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on Twelvefold.com and our Partner Websites. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
12. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues
Children. Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the Website is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18.
Public Areas. We may provide areas on our Website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, or can review and submit media content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a comment, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information.
Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents. California law requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (the “Act”) and the California Business and Professions Code. As required by the Act, we will provide you with the categories of Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the Website and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such Personally Identifiable Information may be shared for direct marketing purposes at your request. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1) the categories of Personally Identifiable Information we collect and what third parties we share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those third parties; and (3) examples of the products marketed by those companies. The Act further requires us to allow you to control who you do not want us to share that information with.

When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Personally Identifiable Information you do not want us to share with affiliated businesses or marketing partners.
