Personal information does not include aggregate, anonymized, or de-identified information (collectively, “Aggregate Information”). “Aggregate Information” is information gathered or generated directly by the use of the Site or Review Service, such as information collected about Site or Review Service users, or a category of services or users, from which any personal information has been removed. An example of Aggregate Information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site’s registered users have identified themselves as male.

Accordingly, please do not post anything that you do not want to share with the general public (for example, financial information, social security number, etc.). In addition, the UGC that you submit may be used for other advertising, analytic and statistical purposes including, for example, product improvement, benchmarking (e.g. where various products/services or categories of products/services are compared against each other or against the market as a whole), sentiment analysis (e.g. using the data from multiple reviews it is possible to determine how consumers as a whole feel about a product/service), and online behavioral advertising.  We may also collect other types of information in connection with your activities on the Review Service, such as demographic information (including, without limitation, your age, weight, size, hair color, sex, occupation, interests, location, and income) and information about or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Review Service, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to provide us with comments or feedback).

During the course of creating an account, you may be asked to submit information, such as but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, and other data (collectively, “Consumer Account Info”).  The Consumer Account Info may be collected by both PowerReviews and the applicable PowerReviews’ client.
