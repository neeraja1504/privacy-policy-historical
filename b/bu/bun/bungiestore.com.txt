The Bungie Web sites consisting of Bungie.com, Bungie.net, "7th Column" and the Bungie Store are operated by the Bungie Inc. or its suppliers (the “Bungie Web Sites”).

Collection of your Personal Information
The use of the Bungie Web Sites does not require you to disclose any personal information. However, the sites offer you the opportunity to register for an account, which permits you to use additional features offered on the Bungie Web Sites, including Bungie Communities, Forums and the Bungie Store. Should you choose to register for an account you will be asked for personal information such as your name and e-mail address. You may also be asked for additional personal information should you choose to subscribe to newsletters or enter sweepstakes.
Bungie.net uses Windows Live™ ID to provide sign-in services. To create an account at Bungie.net, you must use your Windows Live ID. If you do not have a Windows Live ID, you will need to create one. To learn more about Windows Live ID, and how it uses and helps protect your personal information, please see the Windows Live ID home page, and read the posted privacy statement there.
If you are a subscriber of the Xbox Live service, your Gamertag, nicknames and statistics such as high scores may be displayed on Bungie.net; and your online presence will be visible to those on your Xbox Live friends list. You will also have the opportunity to link your Xbox Live Gamertag to your Windows Live ID so that your experience can be personalized and so that you will have access to additional features. If you have already linked your Xbox Live Gamertag and your Windows Live ID on the Xbox.com Web site, Bungie.net will have access to that linkage and you will not be required to do it again. Otherwise, Bungie.net will automatically redirect and sign you in to Xbox.com in order for you to perform the linkage. Once your Gamertag and Windows Live ID have been linked, this linking may also be shared with Microsoft Corporation and other 3rd party game sites in order for those sites to provide you with a personalized experience when you sign in.
