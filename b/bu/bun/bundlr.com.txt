Bundlr - Privacy Policy
We at Bundlr ("we" or Bundlr) have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the bundlr.com, gobundlr.com websites (and sub-domains) but does not apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between bundlr.com, or any other company, and consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on October 26, 2011. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.

If you use a mobile device or application to access Bundlr’s services, we may also collect information about your mobile device, such as the type of device you use.

Third Parties
In limited circumstances, Bundlr may provide personal information to trusted third parties to provide support for the operation of the Website. Personal information will only be disclosed subject to an appropriate confidentiality and security agreement, and only to the extent necessary to perform these support functions.
Disclosures Required by Law
We may disclose your information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or when doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with a law, regulation or legal process; to respond to any claims; to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of any person; to address security or technical issues; or to protect against fraud, misuse or unauthorized use of the Website.

Bundlr does not control the security measures used by such third parties. By using the Website, you assume all risks associated with the potential loss of personal information.
Third Party Links And Content
Bundlr does not control the privacy policies of its partners or other social media sites to which it provides links or access, and the information collection and dissemination policies of such companies are not governed by Bundlr’s Privacy Policy.
