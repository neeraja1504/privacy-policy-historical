Outside of authorised personnel employed by us, we only disclose personal information to third parties that meet our data privacy requirements (in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles and the GDPR). When this occurs, it occurs in a secure and contractually-regulated manner. These third parties include:

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Please be advised that Macropod reserves the right to transfer your data (including personal data) to and from any country, including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

The European Commission has the power to determine, on the basis of the GDPR, whether a country outside the European Union offers an adequate level of data protection by making an ‘adequacy decision’. To date, the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision in respect of Australia. Instead, we rely on other legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world (including transfers to countries like Australia where an adequacy decision has not been adopted). These bases include your consent and the European Commission-approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. You may obtain a copy of the model contractual clauses by contacting us in accordance with the ‘Contact us’ section.
