3.1 Types Of Personal Information We Collect
Bugsnag collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively “Individuals”).
Information You Provide Directly to Us. When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account with Bugsnag, purchasing a Plan from Bugsnag, requesting Services or information, or contacting us directly through the “Contact Us” feature or by some other method, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:
Communications with Us. We may collect Personal Information from you such as name, email address, phone number, company or organization name, location, or mailing address when you use the “Contact Us” feature, register for Bugsnag, choose to request information about our Services, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, which helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services.
Surveys. From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products, Sites and/or Services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.
Purchase of a Plan. When you purchase a Plan on the Site you must provide your email address, first and last name, credit card number, card expiration date and card CVC code. The credit card information is encrypted and transmitted to a Third Party payment processor for processing and storage to a high security vault according to strict industry standards. Once the data reaches the vault it is “tokenized”. No credit card information is received or retained in Bugsnag’s own systems. Your credit card information is not exposed anywhere in our own systems. Please do not send your credit card information to our team directly, for example by emailing this information to privacy@bugsnag.com. Please use our secure, online system to enter your credit card information.
Offline Information. As you might expect, we usually collect or receive information through our Site. But we also may collect information offline and it’s important to us that we preserve the privacy of your Personal Information both online and off. For example, if we speak with you by phone as part of our sales process, we may ask for your location. There are other ways we could learn of Personal Information offline, but this Privacy Notice doesn’t try to predict all those methods. We just want you to know that we try to treat offline information collection, uses and disclosures consistently with our online privacy practices.
Automatic Data Collection. We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, and other browser or device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geolocation information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences. If you click on a link to a Third-Party website or service, a Third-Party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any Third-Parties and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.
Information Submitted Via Services. You agree that Bugsnag is free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. Bugsnag will not release your name or otherwise publicize the fact that you submitted materials or other information to us unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first send notice to you that the materials or other information you submit to a particular part of a Service will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or © we are required to do so by law.
Information from Other Sources. We may receive information about you from other sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you (for example, lead or data enrichment services). . This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Bugsnag and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may also collect information about your online activity after you leave our Site. We use this information to improve the Site and customize your online experience.
Event Data Information. The Bugsnag Services monitor errors in web, mobile and server applications and programs under the direction of its Customers, to provide session, error and crash Event Data. Each Bugsnag Customer provides Bugsnag with session, error and crash Event Data from the Customer’s applications and programs. Event Data may contain personal information of the Customer’s end user. This means that if you are an end user of a service provided by a Bugsnag Customer, then Bugsnag may receive Personal Information about you from the Bugsnag Customer. Not all Customers provide Personal Information about their end users to Bugsnag. Customers use the Services dashboard to control or block the use of end user Personal Information by the Services. Bugsnag itself does not collect this end user Personal Information and Bugsnag has no direct relationship with these individuals. For example, a Customer may direct Bugsnag to log certain software application’s end user information associated with Event Data, such as the end user’s device ID, email and name. Bugsnag is a data processor and follows the instructions of the Customer in these cases. To find out more about how our Customers issue these instructions to us and handle this Personal Information you will need to review the privacy policies of each Customer. An individual who wants to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her request to Bugsnag’s Customer (the data controller). Separately, if our Customer requests that we remove Event Data from the Services then we will respond promptly to this request.
No Sensitive Data or Sensitive Personal Information. Bugsnag does not collect Sensitive Data as defined under the laws of the European Union.
3.2 Personal Information Collected And Controlled By Customers
Bugsnag monitors web, mobile and server applications and programs under the direction of its Customers, to provide error Event Data about the Customer’s applications and programs to the Customer. Event Data may contain Personal Information of the individuals who use the Customer’s applications. Bugsnag itself does not collect this end user Personal Information and Bugsnag has no direct relationship with these individuals. For example, a Customer may direct Bugsnag to log certain software application’s end user information associated with Event Data, such as the end user’s device ID, email and name. Bugsnag is a data processor and follows the instructions of the Customer in these cases.
To find out more about how our Customers issue these instructions to us and handle this Personal Information you will need to review the privacy policies of each Customer. An individual who wants to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her request to Bugsnag’s Customer (the data controller). Separately, if our Customer requests that we remove Event Data from the Services then we will respond promptly to this request.
If you are a Customer then you are responsible for obtaining permission from your end users to share any data that may contain the end users’ Personal Information with the Bugsnag Platform. Customers use the Services dashboard to control or block the use of end user Personal Information by the Services. From time to time Bugsnag creates statistics about the way Customers generally use our Services. These statistics are derived from large sets of anonymized, aggregated Event Data. We refer to this information as “Aggregated Information.” Aggregated Information contains no Personal Information and no information that can be associated with any specific Customer. Bugsnag shares Aggregated Information with its Customers to educate them about the usefulness of the Services and to help them understand industry trends.

From time to time, Bugsnag may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage Third-Party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and Services we provide.

Direct Mail, Email and Outbound Telemarketing. Individuals who provide us with Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from Third-Parties, may receive periodic emails, newsletters, mailings, or phone calls from us with information on Bugsnag’s or our business partners’ products and services or upcoming special offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer the option to decline these communications at no cost to the Individual by following the instructions in Section 5 below.
Services via Mobile Devices. From time to time, Bugsnag may provide Services that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Bugsnag will collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use such Services, like a device identifier, user settings, location information, mobile carrier, and the operating system of your device. Mobile versions of Bugsnag’s Services may require that users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of mobile versions of the Services may be associated with accounts. In addition, Bugsnag may enable Individuals to download an application, widget, or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Bugsnag to enable Individuals to access accounts and to enable Bugsnag to track use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool. Bugsnag may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to Bugsnag to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices Bugsnag provides. This paragraph relates to Personal Information that Bugsnag may collect in connection with a mobile application version of its Services, but is separate from, and does not relate to, Bugsnag’s collection of “Event Data” as set forth above.
Anonymous and Aggregated Information Use. Bugsnag may use Personal Information and other information about you to create anonymized and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access Bugsnag’s Services, or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Bugsnag may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Bugsnag and with Third-Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.
Other Uses. Bugsnag may use Personal Information for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Information or with your consent.
3.4 Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, And Interest-Based Advertising
We, as well as Third-Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.
Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not work properly.
Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
Analytics. We may also use certain analytics tools to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop Site content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information.
Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:
Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Sites, Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Sites, Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular Site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
Performance Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Sites, applications, Services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our Site content, applications, Services, or tools;
Functionality Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Sites, Services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our Sites;
Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or Third-Party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Sites or on Third-Party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.
If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ on our Sites, Services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.
3.5 Third-Party Websites, Social Media Platforms, And Software Development Kits
The Site may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and Bugsnag does not endorse or make any representations about Third-Party websites or social media platforms. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk. Bugsnag’s Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features. The Site and our other Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Site or other Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by Third-Parties for any number of purposes.
3.6 Third-Party Payment Processing
When you purchase a subscription for the Services, we process your payments through a Third-Party payment processor. The Third-Party payment processor may collect certain financial information from you to process a payment on behalf of Bugsnag, including your name, email address, address and other billing information.
4. Onward Transfer - Bugsnag May Disclose Your Information
We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., with our Third-Party service providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your permission.
We Use Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Site. Bugsnag has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.

Bugsnag may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Bugsnag. Bugsnag requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Bugsnag provided them.
Privacy Shield. With respect to onward transfers to Agents under Privacy Shield, Privacy Shield requires that Bugsnag remain liable should its Agents Process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.
Marketing – Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing. Through our Services, Bugsnag may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Bugsnag related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt-out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions in Section 5 below.
Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures). We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect yours’, ours’ or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Bugsnag policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Bugsnag; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.
In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.
Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Bugsnag will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
4.2 Data Transfers
All Personal Information collected via or by Bugsnag may be stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States, Canada, the European Union, in the cloud, on our servers, on the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Bugsnag, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.
5. Opt-Out (Right To Restrict Processing)
5.1 General
You have the right to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Bugsnag’s Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further Processing by contacting us at privacy@bugsnag.com. Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
5.2 Email And Telephone Communications
If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt-out of receiving future emails.

WE MAINTAIN TELEPHONE “DO-NOT-CALL” AND “DO-NOT-MAIL” LISTS AS MANDATED BY LAW. WE PROCESS REQUESTS TO BE PLACED ON DO-NOT-MAIL, DO-NOT-PHONE AND DO-NOT-CONTACT LISTS WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT, OR SUCH SHORTER TIME AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW

Bugsnag may also collect location-based information if you use our mobile applications. You may opt-out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.
5.4 “Do Not Track”
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
5.5 Cookies And Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and www.aboutads.info/choices/.
To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
6. Rights Of Access, Rectification, Erasure, And Restriction
You may inquire as to whether Bugsnag is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or if you believe that your Personal Information has been Processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.

Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Bugsnag makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Bugsnag is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Bugsnag determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Bugsnag will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
