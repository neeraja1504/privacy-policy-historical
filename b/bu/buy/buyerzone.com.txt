How Do We Use Your Information?
We use the information we gather to put buyers and sellers into contact with one another, to provide other features and functionality of this Site, to improve your experience on our Site through analysis and communication, for other purposes described in this policy, and for purposes disclosed to you when you provide information.
To Facilitate Transactions. Buyers or suppliers will receive emails and other communications from us to fulfill or facilitate the purpose for which the information was provided or a request to use a service on this site. You cannot opt out of emails that are necessary to provide our services. By using the services offered on this Site, you agree that we may use your personally identifiable information to contact you and deliver information to you related to those services.
Analysis. In our ongoing effort to improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Your personally identifiable information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.
Testimonials and Feedback. We sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. We, and our service providers, may use your contact information to ask for feedback. Your feedback, both positive and negative, is forwarded to the appropriate departments at BuyerZone as necessary so we can continue to monitor and improve the service we provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature and will display the name you use when registering for the feedback service on the feedback service’s website. If you would like your testimonial removed, please contact us at privacy@buyerzone.com.
Newsletters. We offer valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. If you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of these communications by changing your notification preferences as described below.
Other communications. We may send you email and other communications related to this Site, your use of our services and the status of your account, which may include Site updates and responses to your inquiries. In addition, we send periodic surveys and other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing your notification preferences as described below.
Affiliates. We may share your information with companies that are owned or controlled in whole or in part by Buyerzone.com LLC, so they may engage in any uses that we may engage in as disclosed in this privacy policy. We or our affiliates may use the information you provide us to send you email and other communications on behalf of other BuyerZone affiliates. These communications may include email newsletters, as well as offers for other BuyerZone services. All email newsletters will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of receiving future issues of the newsletter. All promotional offers will include an opportunity to opt out of receiving future promotions from the brand whose product/service is being promoted.
Third Party Offers. We also may use your information to send you e-mail and other communications on behalf of third parties. Each of these communications will include instructions for opting out of receiving future third party offers from us. You may also opt out of receiving third party offers from this Site at any time by sending an e-mail to privacy@buyerzone.com with the subject line "opt out — third party."
How Do We Share Your Information With Others?
Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we only disclose this information as described in this section. Our sharing of information to outside parties is described below. As part of our service to customers, we provide information to suppliers so that they can respond directly to you when you submit a Request for Quotes. Information customers provide to a third party, such as by registering for a third party’s services or making a purchase, is not covered by this privacy policy.
Prospective Buyers. To facilitate our business of matching buyers and suppliers, prospective buyers using our services will be provided information about suppliers relevant to the buyer's request or inquiry using such services. This includes supplier contact information, company background information and, where appropriate, ratings or reviews.
Suppliers. Similarly, suppliers whose products or services are relevant to a prospective buyer's request, and/or marketers, resellers and other service providers performing marketing, fulfillment and/or similar services on behalf of such suppliers with respect to the prospective buyer's request, may be provided with that prospective buyer's information. We contractually limit use of the buyer's information (including all forms of contact information submitted) by the seller to communicating with the buyer, or permitting its marketers, resellers or other service providers to communicate with the buyer, about their desired purchase. In addition, suppliers may receive information about buyers in a manner that does not disclose personally identifiable information. Examples include data that are aggregated across a group of buyers or feedback that is provided without attribution to a specific person or company.
Agents. From time to time, we may use the services of third-party companies to help facilitate our business activities. These include bill collection services, affiliate or incentive program providers, customer service organizations, e-mail and postal mail brokers, and marketing service providers. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and are prohibited from using the information we provide for any reason except to perform the functions that we have outlined for them.
Network Members. We have relationships with third parties to provide our services more broadly throughout the Internet to both buyers and suppliers. When a user has utilized these services through a member of our network, we will share information about these users with the affiliate as necessary. This information is typically reported in an aggregated format.
Advertisers. We may provide your information to third party advertisers (and/or to their service providers on their behalf) to market their products or services under contractual requirement to keep your personally identifiable information confidential and use it only to market and provide (directly and through third parties engaged by them for such purpose) their products or services. You may opt out of such disclosures by sending an e-mail to privacy@buyerzone.com with the subject line: "Do not disclose." We also aggregate information about our collective users for potential advertisers who are interested in understanding whether their offering would be suitable to our audience. This information does not include personally identifiable information like your company name or email address.
Business Transitions. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. If that happens, we may acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, if a portion or all of BuyerZone.com LLC assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. You will receive notice as described in the "Notification of Changes" section below of any change in uses of your personally identifiable information, and choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
Law Enforcement and Legal Process. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we believe to be unlawful. We may also report any activities that we believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole judgment, to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety, of BuyerZone, its parent company, the public, or another user. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law. In certain situations, BuyerZone.com may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may share your information with others as required by law. We may also share your information with others as permitted by law. This may include sharing your information with government entities or third-parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, bankruptcy proceedings, other legal process. We may also share your information if we believe it is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine might be brought against us.
How We Secure Personal Information
We take reasonable and appropriate measures to help keep information secure and to help prevent it from becoming disclosed to individuals who are not described in this policy. Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect, and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
