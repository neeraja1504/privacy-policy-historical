11. What about Rakuten.com and third-party use of "cookies" and "action tags?"
Rakuten.com Cookies:
When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site.

Ad Server and Content Server Cookies:
We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements and other information on our site and other sites or to serve promotional emails or personalized on-line ads.

Except for the company that serves our promotional emails and the company that serves personalized on-line ads, Rakuten.com does not provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information.
Personalized On-line Ad Serving:
We may provide the company that serves our personalized on-line ads with Personally Identifiable Information such as your first name and/or with a product group/category (chosen by Rakuten.com based on your personal preferences and/or prior purchase history e.g., electronics, books, DVDs), which are used to serve you the most relevant personalized on-line ad. The unique identifier included within the cookie placed tells the ad serving company to serve you a personalized on-line ad when you visit the site of a participating web site within the network. The foregoing Personally Identifiable Information is not disclosed to the participating web sites.
Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use outside agents, whose computers will serve ads on our site in the same manner and under the same conditions as above.

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods:

Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers, affiliate program manager and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any Personally Identifiable Information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites.
