At BuyingIQ.com ("BuyingIQ" or "us" or "we" or "Website"), we want the user ("your" or "you") to know exactly how and when we collect and use information that can specifically identify you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address ("personal information"). This privacy policy applies to your use of BuyingIQ and doesn;t apply to any third party linked to us. If you do not agree to this use, please do not use the Website or any of the Services offered on or through the Website.
Note: Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.
COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
BuyingIQ.com does not require that you provide, nor does it collect, any personal information if you are just browsing the Website. We may offer you on the Website non-transactional and transaction based services ("Service(s)") in which, subject to applicable terms and availability, you may participate (e.g., submitting product or store reviews). In order to provide you with the Services you request, BuyingIQ may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is necessary in order for us to fulfill your request. If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information. Any personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, the BuyingIQ Terms of Use and any other applicable Member Agreement with BuyingIQ, and as may otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected. To update, modify or delete any personal information you provide to us with respect to a Service you may access the Account section on BuyingIQ
When you register on BuyingIQ, we collect and store your username, e-mail address and a password. While using some of the BuyingIQ Services, you may also choose to provide the following personal information:
Profile information, including first and last name, location, wishlist etc

Contact information, including email address, mailing address and phone number
Other information that allows us to personalize your experience on the Website
The term "Submissions" refers to the information that you submit or post to BuyingIQ for public display, such as business ratings, reviews, photos, compliments, and the information that you display as part of your account profile. BuyingIQ may publicly display your submissions in order to provide the services that we offer. When we display your submissions, we do so along with your account name (first name and last initial or username). By using the personal information in your submissions (such as a photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account, and contact you. As such please do not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private. You may reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your submissions.
