The Use of Cookies at our Website
BuyAlmost uses so-called “cookies”, which are files that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in customizing your experience with the online service. The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for example by keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of “pop-up” windows. You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your hard drive by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. However, we would like to point out that turning off these settings may result in limited functionality.
Security Measures
Your BuyAlmost account and profile and the information contained therein are password protected. Please note that you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else. BuyAlmost will never ask for your password in e-mails that you receive unexpectedly or that you did not request.
