Privacy Policy | Built NY Insulated Neoprene Wine & Lunch Totes
our customers matter
We are committed to protecting your privacy and security. We cherish the relationship we have with you, and will do nothing to violate your trust in us. Because of this commitment, we never sell, rent or trade email addresses with any other company. And we utilize state-of-the-art security software to protect your financial information.
What information do you need to provide?
When you place an order, we need to know your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and deliver your order, and to send you online order and shipping confirmations and, with your permission, special promotional offers.
When you send a gift to another address, we need to have the name, address and phone number of that person as well, so we are able to correctly deliver your gift.
Do we share any information with other companies?
We never sell, rent or trade email addresses with any other company. If you do not wish to receive information from Lifetime Brands, please contact us by sending an email to BuiltNY.com Customer Service, or call us at 1.844.BUILTNY.
Access to such information is limited to BuiltNY.com employees and business partners engaged in the business of serving its customers. BuiltNY.com employees and business partners are trained in policies regarding safeguarding of customer information and preventing unauthorized access and disclosure. BuiltNY.com may store this information and use it to better understand customer needs, to improve BuiltNY.com products, and to contact customers with offers that may be of interest to them.
How can I discontinue promotional emails?
At the bottom of each email is information about removing your name from our email list. Simply follow the instructions and we'll remove your name. Or call BuiltNY.com Customer Service at 1.844.BUILTNY. Please note that it may take several hours for the change to take effect, and you may receive emails during that time.
After you make a purchase, for your convenience we will still send confirmations and information about your order. We may also contact you by phone or postal mail if we have questions regarding your order.
What about cookies?
BuiltNY.com does use cookies to make your shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. They can only be read by our servers, and are ready to go to work for you every time you return to BuiltNY.com.
Just so you'll know, a cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive. It helps us improve our site design, product selection, services and promotions in ways that serve you better. Cookies are your unique identifier and cannot be executed as a code to deliver viruses.
How can you contact us with your questions or comments?
You can choose from several methods available to get in touch with us. We're always happy to answer your questions or listen to your comments.
How do we protect your personal information?
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your financial information before it is sent. The ordering area of our site is protected this way and is referred to as "secure." Secure transmission is not necessary for our product pictures or general site information and is not used there. This keeps our site faster and your shopping experience more enjoyable. And you never have to worry about sending us your credit card information.
Does BuiltNY.com use SSL technology?
Yes, we do. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the gold standard in Internet encryption. This highly sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our Web site, making it useless to anyone but BuiltNY.com.
As this site continues to expand and offer more products and services, we will update this Privacy Policy. We will post the changes on this page, so you will always be aware of what information we collect, and how we use it.
