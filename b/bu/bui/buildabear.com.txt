Suspected and confirmed Personal Information security incidents will be investigated by the Privacy Officer and/or other personnel as necessitated by the scope of the incident. Such investigation will include, but will not be limited to, determining the source of the breach, identifying the types of data affected, determining whether notifications must be made and instituting any remedial measures that may be necessary to avoid similar incidents in the future.
Build-A-Bear Workshop has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to The Information Commissioner’s Office of the United Kingdom (the “ICO”), the Data Protection Supervisory Authority for the United Kingdom. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit https://ico.org.uk/concerns/eu-us-privacy-shield/ for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the ICO are provided at no cost to you. Under certain limited circumstances, EU individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint.
The FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis referrals alleging non-compliance of the Privacy Shield Principles received from independent dispute resolution bodies, among others. If the FTC concludes that it has reason to believe Section 5 of the Privacy Shield Principles has been violated, it may resolve the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in a federal district court, which if successful could result in a federal court order to same effect.
Use of Human Resource Personal Information Subject to Privacy Shield
Where a member of the Build-A-Bear Workshop group in the EU or UK transfers Personal Information about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or unaffiliated service provider in the U.S. participating in the Privacy Shield, the transfer enjoys the benefits of the Privacy Shield. In such cases, Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee privacy preferences, and will not use employees’ exercise of their rights under Privacy Shield to restrict employment opportunities or take punitive action against employees.
Build-A-Bear Workshop collects Personal Information from its employees to administer employee evaluations, payroll, compensation surveys, benefits, and its Employee Discount Program. Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with all relevant laws, and, as applicable, the Privacy Shield Principles, in the collection and use of employee-related Personal Information. To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing the ability of Build-A-Bear Workshop in making promotions, appointments, or other similar employment decisions, we may not offer employees the notice and choice options described in the Privacy Shield Principles. Similarly, for occasional employment-related operational needs, such as the booking of a flight, hotel room, or insurance coverage, transfers of Personal Information of a small number of employees may take place with limited access or the entering into a contract with the third-party transferee, provided that we otherwise comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Access must also be limited in the context of employee security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with employee succession planning and corporate re-organizations.
Where employees in the EU or UK make complaints about violations of their Personal Information protection rights and are not satisfied with the results of our internal review, complaint, and appeal procedures, they will be directed to the state or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction where the employees work. Build-A-Bear Workshop commits to cooperate with competent EU or UK Data Protection Authorities in the investigation and resolution of Privacy Shield complaints with regard to human resources Personal Information transferred from a European country to the U.S. Build-A-Bear Workshop will comply with any advice given by the Data Protection Authorities where such authorities take the view that we need to take specific action to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles.
