Use of Cookies
The Build A Sign LLC website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a website server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the website server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with the Build A Sign LLC website or services, a cookie helps Build A Sign LLC recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personally identifiable information, such as your billing addresses, shipping addresses, and other similar information. When you return to the same Build A Sign LLC web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Build A Sign LLC features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Build A Sign LLC services or Web sites you visit.
Security
Build A Sign LLC aims to provide reasonable security from unauthorized access, use or disclosure for the personally identifiable information we store. Build A Sign LLC aims to secure the personally identifiable information you provide using computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, reasonably protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When certain sensitive personally identifiable information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, such as payment information in connection with transactions through the Build A Sign LLC website, we use encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, in an effort to protect that information.
Build A Sign LLC will not record, store, or save your credit card number without providing notice to you and receiving your express consent.
