For instance, when you register for any portion of BP's services, enter a sweepstakes or contest, or complete a survey, you are asked to provide, among other things, information like your e mail address, name, telephone number, fax number, and information about interest in our services, products, and programs.

BP may, as necessary, allow access to our database to third parties that provide us services, such as, the technical maintenance of our website. BP limits such access for the purposes of providing our website and/or services.
As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned by BP are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired, the information from and about BP's users may be among the transferred assets.

"PRIVATE" MESSAGING
Our website offers an in-house means of communication called 'Private Messaging.' BP reserves the right to read and transfer these messages under extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to examples such as legal compulsion by authorities, unlawful physical threats or activities, and mass spamming. In six years, we have only had to do this twice, and we do not maintain administrative tools to accomplish the task. We leave it a difficult undertaking because we abhor the practice under anything less than obligation by law. If you require an off-site means of communication, use email.
