BUCKEYE WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
In connection with your visitation of one of Buckeye’s websites, a n d d e p e n d i n g o n t h e s e r v i c e s
y o u a c c e s s t h r o u g h t h e w e b s i t e s , personally-identifiable information may be collected and
maintained by Buckeye, including: your name, service address, email address, passwords, user IDs, billing
address, home telephone, other telephone, social security number and driver's license number, premium
service subscription information, demographic information, and customer complaints. We may also
collect access log information about your visit, including information such as the Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses assigned (numbers assigned to your computer while online), browser used, and dates and times
of access. We do not store emails sent and received other than as required to provide customer service or as
specifically directed by your individual email settings. As explained below, we could be required by court
order to disclose such information if left on our system.
Buckeye uses the personally-identifiable information collected for financial, tax, and accounting purposes,
and it uses the personally-identifiable information and access log information to provide and improve
customer service, and to monitor unauthorized reception or use of Buckeye services.
Buckeye may disclose this information to third-parties under legal compulsion, or if necessary to respond to
your inquiry or other service request or to provide broadband Internet access service to you, such as (without
limitation) to other Internet service providers, collection agencies, construction and installation contractors,
marketing companies, and other service providers. We will not otherwise use this information without
notifying you and receiving any required written or electronic consent.
We use "Secure Socket Layer" encryption technology when collecting certain personal information
through our websites. Such protection is identifiable by looking for "https" in the Internet URL or page
address or, if you are using Internet Explorer, by a closed lock symbol. While we attempt to ensure the
integrity and security of our network and computer systems, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent unauthorized access.
If necessary, Buckeye will investigate suspected violations of the Subscription Agreement or the
Acceptable Use Policy, as well an suspected fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to,
Buckeye services and sites. Such investigation may include gathering information from the user or users
involved and from complaining parties, and examining material on Buckeye's servers and network.
Buckeye will cooperate fully with (i) law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected
criminal violations, and (ii) Internet Service Providers or other network or computing facilities in order to
enforce the Subscription Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy. Such cooperation may include Buckeye
providing the username, IP address, or other identifying information about a subscriber or user of the
Buckeye websites, or other disclosures in accordance with customer agreements and terms of service or
access.
Buckeye maintains this information as long as you are a customer. After you are no longer a customer, the
system will maintain this information for three (3) years or as long it is reasonably commercially
necessary, unless there is an outstanding balance due, in which case Buckeye will maintain this
information for seven (7) years. Although work-performed records are retained for a longer period of
time, there is no way these records can be accessed after three (3) years [or seven (7) years if there is an
outstanding balance due] through the use of any personally-identifiable information. The computer
records are purged at least every six (6) months.
Specific restrictions and prohibitions regarding our acquisition and use of personally identifiable
subscriber information for our broadband Internet access service subscribers are as follows:

1. Except as provided herein or upon express written or electronic consent, we will not collect
or disclose personally-identifiable information regarding any of our customers.
2. Personally-identifiable information shall be made available for your examination within three (3)
working days of the receipt of a request from you. You shall be responsible for all costs of
copying of documents supplied. Upon a reasonable showing, Buckeye is required to correct any
inaccurate information. All personally-identifiable information will be made available between

3. We may disclose personally-identifiable information as required by law, law enforcement, or
government agencies.
If you register with us while visiting a website or by participating in a contest, survey or online
transaction, we may ask for certain personally-identifiable information. When we do, we will tell you
how it will be used and you may elect not to participate.
We may use "cookies," small computer codes added to a file on your computer, as a record of its visit to
our websites or to other websites through our network. Among other functions, “cookies” manage
information concerning your preferences. A “cookie” does not collect or provide your name or any other
personal information about you. It can, however, be used by the website that placed it to note information
about your visit, such as your type of web browser, operating system and Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
to better tailor the site for you. It also can recognize you when you log in as a registered user or as a
repeat visitor returning to a website, including any Buckeye website, allowing the site to remember you
and any options you select, and to provide more tailored information for you. You can control what
cookies are accepted by your computer through the settings on your web browser or by deleting them
from your files. However, doing so may limit the personalization available to you.
