INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy explains how Bucksense, Inc. (" Bucksense " or " us " or “ we ”) collects, uses, and shares information from and about you when you interact with a mobile application or website that displays Bucksense advertisements (“ Bucksense Ad Platform ”or “ Platform ” or “ Service ”).
Bucksense serves advertisements to end users of various publishers (such as website operators or mobile app developers), via real-time marketplace platforms exchanges (" Exchanges ") and/or such publishers. Those ads are provided by advertisers, who use Platform to serve their ads and manage the overall performance of their ad campaigns, including by using third party services that integrate with our Platform. When an end user receives or clicks on an ad, we might receive or collect some or all of the data provided below, whether from the end user's device, from the relevant Exchange/s, from third parties and/or publishers (" Data ").
We generally do not collect or use personal information about individual users through the Bucksense Service. When we say “ Personal Information ”, we mean individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of and/or directly contact a specific living person, such as an email address or telephone number. We collect personal information only when we are contacted directly by an individual through the our site and the individual voluntarily provides personal information to us, such as by submitting a question or registering to use the Bucksense Service. Bucksense does not collect Personal Information about consumers that receive advertiser offers through the Bucksense Service.
You are not legally obligated to provide us any Data. If you do not want Platform to collect such Data, please follow the instructions below toOpt-Out.

COLLECTION OF DATA
The Bucksense Services collect information about your device and the ads that we deliver onto your device. This data, which is collected passively using various technologies may come from such sources as your web browser or the apps that you use. We also may obtain the precise location (e.g., lat/long coordinates) of your device and may use that information to deliver targeted ads. We may also combine the information collected across multiple sites and mobile apps in order to create interest segments that help us target future advertisements based upon those inferred interests. This practice is sometimes referred to as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising. We use this information as part of the Bucksense Services to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same user (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked. We may share this information with clients, vendors, and other companies that we conduct business with as permitted by law.
When we present an ad on your device we might receive or collect some or all of the following:
Which application will present the ad
If you clicked the ad and when
IP address
User Agent
Carrier where applicable
General location (i.e. city or zipcode)
Android advertising ID or Apple advertising ID (IDFA) as applicable
In operating the Bucksense Service we may use the following technologies:
Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser. Bucksense or our Clients and Partners may deploy a cookie on your browser when you click on the ad banner. This technology may provide with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your visits.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We or our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, remember you, track trends, and collect information about how you use Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We, or our Clients or Partners, may use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Bucksense ad services and those using our Bucksense ad services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and other related services to be implemented. Sometimes, we obtain data through other interfaces that deliver similar data to us, which are commonly referred to as APIs. We may use these technologies, for example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.If you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the Opt-Out paragraph. Our clients or partners may use the above technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate identifiers across platforms, browsers, or devices, in order to more efficiently analyze or target advertising.
