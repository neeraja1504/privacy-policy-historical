From you.  We receive and store information that you submit on our website or give us in other ways (such as via telephone or through the mail). This consists of information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, date of birth, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences (such as meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options) as well as your entertainment interests (such as tour itineraries, performance and activity interests, and venue preferences). You can choose not to provide information to us, but generally this information is necessary for you to register as a user, make bookings for travel or entertainment, complete a profile, receive updates of flight delays or schedule changes, post reviews, contribute to a discussion forum, participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, ask us a question, or initiate other transactions on our website. If you decline to supply or provide us with information while using our website, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of its features.
About Travel Companions. When you make a reservation on behalf of one or more travel or activity companions using our website, we will request personal information as well as interests, styles and preferences for each of those individuals. You should obtain the consent of those individuals prior to submitting such information, as access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.
As May Be Required By Law.  Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program, most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable). Secure Flight is a federally mandated program administered by the TSA. The privacy notice of the TSA is as follows:
The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires aircraft operators to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site atwww.tsa.gov.
From Other Sources.  From time to time we may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from our affiliated entities, business partners or other third party sources and add it to our account information about you. Examples of such information include updated address information, purchase history, and demographic data. In addition, if you sign up for BudgetAir.com using your social media account, link your BudgetAir.com account to your social media account, or use certain other BudgetAir.com social media features, we may access information about you through that social media provider, subject to that provider's policies. The information may include your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends, and other information that you authorize us to receive. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") or "likes" in order to provide you with relevant content. Note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider, subject to your privacy settings with that social media provider.

Display of tailored advertising and your choices
Data collected by us to serve you with relevant advertising. We want to help provide you with relevant content and other information as you use the Internet. To do this, we may, through Cookies and other technologies, collect and store information about your travel-related or other searches, such as prospective itineraries, airfare information or entertainment bookings in which you indicate interest. We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. For example, if you search for a flight to Shanghai on our website, you may see an advertisement for a Shanghai travel package on our website or on another website you visit. We do not combine information we collect about your travel-related or other searches with personal information (such as your email address) in order to serve you with advertisements nor do we share your personal information with third parties so that they can serve you with advertisements.

Data collected by others to serve you with relevant advertising.  The advertisements you see on our website are served by us or by our service providers. However, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through Cookies and other technologies.
