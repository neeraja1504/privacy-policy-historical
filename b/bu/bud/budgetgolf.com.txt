The Site uses a feature of Internet Web browsers called a Cookie, which is a file that a User's Web browser places on a User's computer's hard drive, to assign an identification code to the computer and to collect anonymous browsing information.

Children
The BudgetGolf.com Site is not directed towards children under 13 years of age and BudgetGolf does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age through the Site.
Security
Because we care, this Site has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Information under our control, including credit card information that is submitted to BudgetGolf. When Users place orders or access their account information, the Site uses secure server software (SSL), which encrypts all information Users' input before it is sent to us. In addition, we do not store User's credit card numbers in their online accounts so if someone obtains your account log in information, they will not be able to view a User's credit card number. Thus, we have taken steps to protect the Information we collect from you from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, BudgetGolf makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. BudgetGolf shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.
Sale or Acquisition
In the event that another company acquires BudgetGolf or all or part of its assets, we reserve the right to include Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.
