The Business of Software Privacy Policy is published by Business of Software. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection and use of information relating to your use of the Business of Software Web site (collectively, including all content available through the www.businessofsoftware.org domain and sub-domains, “the Site”)
Business of Software is registered with the UK’s Information Commission as a Data Controller (registration no. A8436632) in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998.
We take the privacy of Users of the Site seriously and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of these Users while providing a personalised and valuable service. This privacy policy sets out our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the Site. If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to these practices please contact us by e-mail at privacy@businessofsoftware.org
The Site collects information from Users during the registration process and, occasionally, at other times. We try and make the process as rapid and straightforward as possible and we are grateful for the information our Users provide. The more accurate the information we receive from each User, the more specific we can be in our ongoing contact with them.
Data protection
The Site will comply with the relevant UK Data Protection laws, so normally any personal details to be provided to us will not be disclosed to third parties outside Business of Software’s Customers without the User’s consent (please see also the Site’s Terms and Conditions regarding Data Protection).
Users must be aware and accept that, if we are requested by authorised third parties or regulatory or governmental agencies investigating illegal activities to provide information concerning Users’ activities whilst using the Site, we shall do so.
Similarly, we will disclose Users’ personal data if we are compelled to do so by law. We reserve the right to notify or provide such information to the relevant authority if, in our opinion, we believe an emergency, illegal activity or some other reasonable basis exists for us doing so.
We reserve the right to store and use Users’ personal data solely for our own internal purposes and we further reserve the right to access, monitor and retrieve password-protected information in order to fulfil our obligations in these terms and conditions.
Uses of registration information
Registration information we receive from Users is used by us as follows:
to allow us to ensure your continued access to the Site;
to allow us to develop the Site in ways that you will find relevant and interesting;
to let us tell you about new material we have produced that in our reasonable opinion is going to be of relevance and interest to you; and
to provide sponsors and advertisers on the Site with aggregate information about our User base and usage patterns
to make selected introductions between subscribers with a view to enabling their business activities
When you register, you can choose not to be contacted by us. Any of our Users can also contact us at any time to ask to be removed from our Subscriber list. If you wish to remove your details, you should contact us by email: privacy@businessofsoftware.org.
On registration, you will be provided with an opportunity to opt out of being automatically registered for other Business of Software services, or from receiving information from Business of Software or any advertiser or sponsor of the Site.
Security
We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard security systems.
