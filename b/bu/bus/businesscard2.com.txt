Sharing Your Information
BusinessCard2 has been designed to maintain and distribute your professional identity.
BusinessCard2 has been designed to for commercial purposes only. We advise against using it to store personal information. Nevertheless, we will not sell, rent, or trade the information you provide online unless you permit us to do so. We do share your information with certain business clients and partners as part of the product or service offering of the company and your participation therein. We may disclose information to third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights of businesscard2.com, a service of Workface Inc., its divisions, or its subsidiaries. We reserve the right to transfer your information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, we may give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your information. In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing you the services or products that Workface provided.
Contact Importer
The BusinessCard2 contact importer tool allows you to upload your contacts for the purpose of inviting and connecting with the professionals in your network online, as well as sharing your BusinessCard2 with your contacts. This helps establish credibility and a community around your profile. If you enter in your password for other contact management programs you use to access your contacts, your password is not stored in our system, nor does anyone have access to view it.
When you use the invite system in BusinessCard2, we will send invites on your behalf using your name. We may send follow up emails as well, but there will always be opt out options for these contacts if they no longer wish to receive these messages. The contact information provided will be stored indefinitely to help ensure that users that opt out of messages will never receive messages, and also if any contacts who join BusinessCard2 can be easily connected with users in their network.
Your Choices About Receiving Email
We may send you e-mail as part of the private messaging system, with details about your account, or in response to your questions. Businesscard2.com, a part of Workface Inc., its divisions, and its subsidiaries may also send you e-mail with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail. This option applies to promotional e-mail only, as we may find it necessary to send you e-mail relating to your account or order, or as part of the services that you have subscribed to.
