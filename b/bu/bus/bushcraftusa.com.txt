If you are from the European Union, Canada, or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law and you are registering an account on the Site, visiting the Site or otherwise using the Site, please note that any personally identifiable information that you provide to Bushcraft USA may be transferred to or utilized by Bushcraft USA or its affiliates in the United States. Any such personally identifiable information provided may be processed and stored in the United States by Bushcraft USA or a service provider acting on its behalf.
The Information Bushcraft USA Collects
Users may provide and Bushcraft USA may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways. Personally identifiable information may include, without limitation: (i) contact data (such as a User’s name, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) demographic data (such as a User’s zip code or age); (iii) financial information collected to process orders or purchases made from Bushcraft USA via the Site or otherwise (such as credit card, debit card or other payment information); or (iv) other information requested during the account registration process. If you communicate with Bushcraft USA by e-mail or otherwise, post User Content to the Site, post messages to any forums, complete online forms, surveys or entries, provide information outside of the account registration process, or otherwise interact with or uses the features on the Site, any information you provide may be collected by Bushcraft USA.
Bushcraft USA may also collect information about how Users use the Site, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of the Site, or the domains and Internet Protocol (“ IP ”) addresses from which Users originate. While not all of the information that Bushcraft USA collects from Users is personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that Users provide Bushcraft USA through the Site or otherwise. Additionally, certain information regarding your computer systems, network locations, IP address, and software may be communicated to Bushcraft USA in certain circumstances by the digital rights management systems associated with certain Content that you download or access via the Site in order to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the associated Content. Non-personally identifiable information collected by Bushcraft USA (such as patterns of utilization) is exclusively owned by Bushcraft USA and may be used as it sees fit in accordance with applicable law.
Cookies
Like most web sites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer that allows Bushcraft USA to recognize you as a User when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. Like the information you enter during account registration, cookies and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Site. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you have logged in to your Site account. The next time you visit our Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Site. In order to access or change any of your private information, you must log in with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Site.
IP Addresses
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, we automatically receive the uniform resource locator (“ URL ”) of the web site from which you came and the web site to which you proceed once you leave the Site. We also receive the IP address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your Internet service provider (“ ISP ”). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is shared with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Web Beacons and Ad Networks
We may allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users via the Site. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Bushcraft USA may “target” some ads to Users that fit a certain general profile. To deliver these ads properly, the Site may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Site or implement other monitoring technologies so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other web sites. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other web sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. In addition, the Site may use the technology of ad networks to serve ads only when you visit this Site. Ad networks may use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you while you visit this Site. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
How Bushcraft USA Uses Information
Bushcraft USA may use personally identifiable information collected through the Site for the specific purposes for which the information was collected, to contact Users regarding Content, advertise products or services offered by Bushcraft USA, or otherwise to enhance Users’ experience with Bushcraft USA and/or the Site.

Bushcraft USA will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this Site. These may include a series of welcome emails which help inform new Users about various features of the Site, emails, confirmations regarding actions taken by you on the Site, and notices relating to the proper functioning of the Site or your account. Bushcraft USA may use your personal information to send you promotional information relating to the Content, products, and services offered by third parties that Bushcraft USA feels may be of interest to you. The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new developments, new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, surveys, contests, and events of interest.

To opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, please contact that partner directly. We may send Bushcraft USA emails that may contain information regarding third party products or services; however, this doesn’t mean that we’ve traded your personal information to any party.
Disclosure of Information
Bushcraft USA may disclose personally identifiable information collected from Users to its parent, subsidiary, and other related companies, trusted affiliates, independent contractors, and business partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined above, as necessary to provide the services offered by the Site and the Site itself, and for the specific purposes for which the information was collected.
