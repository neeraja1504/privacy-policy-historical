What is “Personal Information”?
Personal information is information about you that uniquely identifies you as an individual. Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number are all examples of personal information.  However, the name, address and telephone number of an individual that appears in a telephone directory that is available to the public (where such individual can refuse to have such information appears in such directory) does not fall under the scope of “personal information as it is publicly available information. Also, in some circumstances, some of this information may qualify as business information which is not covered by this Statement.
