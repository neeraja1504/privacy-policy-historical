Does BUSTERS Share the Information It Receives?
Simply said, no. Under no circumstances will we ever give away or sell your personal information to anyone else for any reason whatsoever, without prior written approval from yourself. Any information we gain through our use of customer polls, surveys, cookies, session tracking or anything else, is used internally and for the sole purpose of providing you better service. If you are on our mailing list and you ask us to remove you, we will immediately and will not attempt to sell on your information. As we do with our own, we respect your privacy.
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to other companies. We share customer information only as described in this statement and with subsidiaries of BUSTERS with controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow the practice at least as protective as that described in this Notice.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
All of our employees and partners are familiar with our security policy and practices. Your personal information is only accessible to a limited number of qualified people who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet.
While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we will not be liable for any such occurrences. You will find that almost all Internet e-commerce providers make this same claim, especially if they use privacy policy templates such as this one to make known their company or organization privacy policies.
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off when you finish using a computer.
What Choices Do I Have?
As discussed above, you always have the choice not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase with BUSTERS. You can add or update certain information on your Personal BUSTERS pages at any time. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail from us, simply click the Preferences link at the footer of any email sent by BUSTERS and you will be removed from our mailing list. To remove other personal information from BUSTERS, please contact our offices. Please note that you cannot opt-out of communication pertaining to services such as making a purchase on BUSTERS.
Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions
If you choose to visit BUSTERS, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the laws of the Republic of South Africa. If you have any concern about privacy at our site, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
Because our business changes constantly, our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web Site frequently to see recent changes.
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
BUSTERS features public forums where users with similar interests can share information and support one another or where users can post questions. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered private.
Any information you share in any online community area is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.
Consumer Protection Act (CPA)
South African CPA laws shall supersede any BUSTERS terms and conditions which conflict with the act or any other laws in the Republic of South Africa.
