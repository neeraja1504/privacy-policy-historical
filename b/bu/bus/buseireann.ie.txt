Keeping your information secure
CIÉ is committed to protecting the information you provide. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, CIÉ has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
When you purchase travel tickets online or access your personal profile you can do so through a secure server. The use of SSL technology means that all personal information, such as your credit/debit card number, will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the CIÉ Online Booking Engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal card transaction by telephone. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.
If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data will be protected. If your browser does not support SSL, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise the transmission of your personal data may not be protected and CIÉ disclaims any responsibility in this regard.

*URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For example, http://www.CIE.ie is the URL for CIÉ's home page.
**An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
