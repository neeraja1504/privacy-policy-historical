Privacy Policy - Businessday NG
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
BusinessDay together with its affiliate brands (BusinessDay Research and Intelligence Unit and BusinessDay Conferences & Events) takes your privacy seriously. We’ve laid out our GDPR compliant policy to serve you better and keep you in control over the information you allow us to collect. Our privacy policy may change so we recommend you check back on this page so you can always understand what your rights are.
1. What’s in this policy?
This policy tells you:
What information we might collect about you
How we might use that information
When we might use your details to contact you
What information of yours we might share with others
Your control over personal information you give us
2.  What does this policy cover?
This policy covers the services that are offered by BusinessDay well as other services provided under the BusinessDay brand including BusinessDay Research and Intelligence Unit and BusinessDay Conferences & Events and social media pages.
What’s not covered in this policy?
Content found on BusinessDay sometimes contains links to services run by other companies. Those companies will likely have their own privacy and cookies policies, so please keep in mind that our privacy policy only governs your data on our digital properties. Once you leave BusinessDay’s online property the information you give will govern their rules, not ours.
How do you protect my personal information?
We’re committed to keeping your information safe and we keep this at the center of our design process. We are constantly evaluating the best options available to media companies when it comes to guaranteeing the safety of our most important stakeholders, you.
That said, no service can be completely secure. If at any time, you feel your personal information is at risk, for example, a concern that someone got a hold of your password, you should contact us immediately. We’ll be happy to guide you through your options for changing your password.
Where we store your information
While our data centers are located in The United States for now, some of our partners or service providers may choose to host and process your information in a location outside of Nigeria. Security is a critical factor when we consider who we work with, Some companies that provide services to us run their services from outside Nigeria/the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be transferred, stored or processed in a location outside Nigeria/Africa/the EEA.

Every time we ask for your personal information, we’ll give details about why we need it and how we’ll use it before you begin.
1. Information that you give to us
Most frequently we will ask for information like Name, date of birth, and contact details. Occasionally, depending on what you’re signing up for, we may ask for other information. For example, if you’re signing up to receive an Election Newsletter we may ask you if you have your PVC. This will always be very clear.

When you give us any personal information we’ll let you know how long we’ll hold it for. And always stick to these principles:
We only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a valid reason to keep it.

We design our services so that we don’t hold your information any longer than we have to

6. How can BusinessDay use my personal information?
We have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. It’s called the “lawful basis for processing“. Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like when you subscribe to an email. Other times, when you’d reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don’t ask your permission, but only when:
The law says it’s fine to use it, and
It fits with the rights you have.
We use your information for these types of things:

This could be showing you a BusinessDay advertising message where we know you have a BusinessDay account and have used BusinessDay services.
If you don’t want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies’ settings. Also, you can visit your BusinessDay account and turn off personalization, but it will also turn off all personalized services.

But we want to use others like functional, performance and advertising cookies to make your experience more enjoyable. We’ll only use them if you’ve agreed. You can always change your mind.
Bear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These “third-party cookies” might track how you use different websites, including ours.

Another way to control some tracking is in the settings on your device.

We update this policy sometimes. If we make important changes, like how we use your personal information, we’ll let you know. It might be a notice, an email, or a message in your app.
