We at B.O.S. are taking a leadership role in assisting our customers and other businesses in understanding the importance of using your personal information appropriately.

On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where B.O.S. has presented content together with one of our retail partners) a privacy notice unique to that site will be presented.
Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.

Sharing Your Personal Information
B.O.S. will not sell, rent, or trade the personal information you provide online. We do share your personal information with certain B.O.S. business affiliates.
B.O.S. may disclose personal information to third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights of B.O.S. or its subsidiaries.
B.O.S. reserves the right to transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, B.O.S. will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information. In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you the services or products that B.O.S. provided.
Your Choices about Receiving E-mail
B.O.S. may send you e-mail about your orders or your account and in response to your questions. B.O.S. and its subsidiaries may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate you do not want to receive them.
We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference regarding the receiving of promotional e-mail when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail. If you choose not to accept this promotional e-mail, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you. This option applies to promotional e-mail only, as we may find it necessary to send you e-mail relating to your account or order.
Promotional e-mail that you receive from B.O.S. will tell you how to decline receiving future promotional e-mail.
Information Collected through Use of Cookies and Other Technologie s
B.O.S. automatically receives and records data on our servers from visitor browsers including computer IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and other information through the use of cookies. This information is collected about thousands of site visits and analyzed as a whole. This analysis looks for trends among many visitors to B.O.S. or other B.O.S. sites, and determines which parts of the site are accessed most frequently and what information visitors find most valuable.
We may also collect and record information about what you viewed on our Web site. We may use this type of information and combine it with your personal information to help customize our future interactions with you. In doing so, we hope to provide better service to you by tailoring our communications to match your interests- to give you more of what you want and less of what you don't want.
Protecting Your Information
B.O.S. implements a variety of administrative, managerial, and technical security measures to help protect your personal information. B.O.S. has Internal Control Standards which relate specifically to the handling of personal information. These include certain controls to help safeguard the information we collect online.
B.O.S. employees are trained to understand and comply with these controls and we communicate our privacy policy, practices and guidelines to our employees. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, you must also take steps to protect your information. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal information while you are on the Internet.
Communities
Some of our sites may enable you to participate in public services such as discussion boards, chats, and live events. Please use discretion when posting personal information about yourself when using these services. Be aware that when you disclose personal information at these sites, such as your name, member name, e-mail address, etc., the information may be collected and used by others to send unsolicited e-mail. The services are open to the public, and what you post there can be seen by anyone and is not protected. B.O.S. cannot control the comments that you may receive while you participate in these services. You may find other people's comments to be offensive, harmful or inaccurate.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important, and those under the age of 13 are protected by federal law. For that reason, B.O.S. does not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or to buy goods and services on our sites, without verifiable parental consent. B.O.S. does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except with their parent's express consent.
If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow parents to request removal of their children's personal information.
B.O.S. encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to participate in their interactive activities and interests.
Outside Links
Some B.O.S. Web sites contain links to and from other Web sites and B.O.S. is not responsible for the privacy practices of those Web sites. B.O.S. encourages you to ascertain the privacy practices of those Web sites.
