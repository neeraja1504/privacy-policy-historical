WHAT IS A LOG FILE?
A log file is a recording of everything that goes in and out of a particular server. It is a concept much like the black box of an airplane that records everything going on with the plane in the event of a problem. The information is frequently recorded chronologically, and is located in the root directory, or occasionally in a secondary folder, depending on how it is set up with the server. The only person who has regular access to the log files of a server is the server administrator, and a log file is generally password protected, so that the server administrator has a record of everyone and everything that wants to look at the log files for a specific server.
