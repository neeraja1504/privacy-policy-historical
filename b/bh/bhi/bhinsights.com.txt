Privacy and Security | B&H Photo Video
Security:
Please note: The following only applies to B&H's main website (www.bhphotovideo.com) but not to our blog "B&H Explora" (www.bhphotovideo.com/explora). The security of your personal information is very important to us. In an effort to protect your personal information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with 256 bit encryption. If your browser supports SSL (most current browsers do), it will automatically encrypt the information you provide to us on the secure pages on our site, before sending it over the internet. B&H has obtained a digital certificate from Cybertrust, a leading provider of internet trust services. B&H's website is also tested and certified daily by ScanAlert to receive its Hacker Safe Certification which ensures that the website passes the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test.
When visiting a page on our site that includes any of your personal information, the bottom of your browser window will display an icon of a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending upon your browser). This indicates that you have successfully connected with our secure server.
To authenticate the security of your connection before submitting any of your personal information, you can double-click on the icon to display our digital certificate.
Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, we suggest that you visit the B&H super store, or contact us by phone, or fax your order to us.
Cookies:
When you visit our site, we will ask your browser to place a permanent "cookie" (a very small text file) on your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, it will accept the cookie and place it on your computer's hard drive. We collect this information to analyze where our customers are coming from and how often they visit our site. We also collect certain technical information from your computer, like your IP address and the address of a referring web site, if any. This information will allow us to enhance our site to match our customer's preferences. This information is used only for the benefit of B&H and you, our customer.
You can visit our site without cookies if you choose to do so. However, please be aware that some features of the site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows the error.
If you place an order with a ship-to address that differs from your bill-to address, we retain this information as well. You can modify or correct this information by following the procedure described above. Such information is used at your request to ship purchased merchandise and may also be used for marketing purposes, but will not be sold to any third parties.
What Information Is Collected:
When you choose to place an order with us, you are invited to log in (optional), so that we can identify who you are. As a newcomer, it will be suggested that you register for future identification.

You can update this information at any time by clicking on the "my account" link at the top of every page and selecting "update account information."
Placing an Order:
When you decide to place an order, you are asked to complete an order form. The order form requires your name, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, expiration date and CID#.
