How We Use This Information
When you place an order on our website or through our customer service department, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order confirmation and shipping status emails.
We also maintain a record of your purchases.  We may combine information you provide with demographic information and information that is publicly available.  We may also use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve our site design and enhance your shopping experience.  If you communicate online with our customer service representatives, we will use the information you convey to respond to your requests and serve you better.
We may also use your information to present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates. If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy statement applies.
If we offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional obligations.  In these instances, you may receive emails, or postal mail from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions.  Even if you have previously chosen not to receive email or postal mail from us, you may still receive information as it relates to the sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey in which you have participated.
In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, we may disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.
Except as required by law, or as otherwise provided in this policy, we will not share your email address with unaffiliated third parties.  You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request, process or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our website or the public.
When you supply your postal address, you may receive mail from us. We do not make our mailing lists available for use by unaffiliated third parties.
Unless otherwise specified herein, we reserve the right to compile, save, use within the scope of our activities, and analyze any and all data about you (contact and personal data, use history etc.) that we collect from you through the site. We use the personal information about you that you provide to us for our internal purposes, such as responding to your requests for information or materials, contacting you, conducting internal analyses such as surveys and market research, processing and completing orders, processing your payment, administering your account, and administering and developing our business relationship with you or the company you represent. We also use your personal information to communicate with you, for example, to provide you with administrative communications regarding your account, newsletters, press releases, or information or advertisements relating to products, offers, or programs that may be of interest to you. By submitting this personal information to us you (or your legal representative on your behalf) consent to this use.
We have a general policy of not disclosing your personal information to third parties unless you have consented to such sharing. However, we may share the personal information about you that you provide to us with trusted companies we work with to provide services for us, such as sending out our newsletters, fulfilling orders you submit, or collecting and processing information on our behalf. These companies—our vendors—are contractually bound to use personal information that we share with them only to perform the services we have engaged them to provide. Other companies may collect and use information you provide to us to better understand the offers, promotions and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After the information is collected by these third parties, it is aggregated so it is not personally identifiable or tied to you or any other user. If you would prefer that these companies not collect your information, please email us at info@BHFO.com or contact us by phone at 1-855-588 (LUV)-2436 (BHFO).
We may also share your personal information in the event that our business is transferred to another entity by way of merger, sale of the company’s assets or otherwise. If you consent to sharing of your personal information, we may share your information with related entities and selected third parties so that they may provide you with or contact you regarding information and materials that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your information in this manner, please refer to the section below on opting in and out.
We may also collect and group demographic and preferences information, responses to surveys and other personal information that we collect from you into an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form for disclosure to our existing or potential business partners, affiliates, sponsors or other third parties. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the site.
From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal statistical information about the use of the site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail herein. We collect this information to determine which areas of the site are most popular and to enhance the site for visitors. As with other aggregated data, we may disclose such data to our existing or potential business partners, affiliates, sponsors or other third parties, but this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the site.

How We Work With Third Party Service Providers
We may use reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders and conducting promotions, maintaining and managing our customer database and reporting on customer behavior and/or preferences.  Sometimes these service providers need information about our customers in order to provide services to us and to our customers. When we allow these service providers access to your information, we require them to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and we do not permit them to use it in any way other than to help us provide you with better service.
