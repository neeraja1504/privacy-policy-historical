Information Security Tips
As part of Bank Audi’s commitment and continuous efforts to keep your account and personal information safe and secure, here are a few useful tips you should follow:
Social Engineering
Fraudulent Emails and Websites
Spywares and Viruses
Credit Card Fraud
Social engineering is a technique used to manipulate people into performing actions or divulging confidential information by tricking or misleading them to bypass security measures and tools. The purpose is to gather confidential information from people through phone, email, regular mail, unsolicited text messages (SMS) or direct contact and use this information in illegal activities such as committing fraud, gaining unauthorized access to systems, etc.
Tips to recognize an act of social engineering
During a social engineering attack, the attacker usually:
Requests the victim to provide confidential and personal information.
Refuses to provide specific information or indications that may reveal his/her identity.
Uses different approaches and techniques that rely on confidence, persuasion, intimidation, assistance, etc.
Attempts to mislead and/or intimidate the victim in order to obtain quick and spontaneous responses.
Tips to avoid being the victim of social engineering
Always be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls or emails from individuals requesting personal or confidential information. Verify their identity first by contacting their organization directly.
Do not use contact information provided by these individuals; instead, check previous statements or other sources for contact information.
Always check whether the individual requesting sensitive information is authorized to have this information.
Do not be influenced by the attackers’ attitude and do not take what you are told for granted. Always verify the identity of the requester and his/her authority to have the information.
What you should do if you are the victim of social engineering
If you suspect you are a victim of a social engineering attack, immediately report the incident to Bank Audi’s Help Desk and/or your branch manager. Cancelling your credit card and/or changing your e-banking User ID and Password might be required depending on the nature of the information you revealed.
