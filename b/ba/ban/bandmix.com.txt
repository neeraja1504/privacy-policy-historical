KEY TERMS USED IN THIS POLICY
Cookies are unique identifiers usually in the form of small data files placed on your device that send certain information about your activity on the Website or in an email communication back to us or the authorized third party that served the cookie.
Personal Information is information that specifically identifies you or that, when combined with other information, could be used to identify you, such as your name, location, IP address or other similar identifiers specific to you.
Tracking Technologies are web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies that are also unique identifiers used to track your online activity.
INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU
BandMix directly collects information when you:
create a user profile, both when accessing the free and paid versions of the Services;
use the Website to search for musicians, groups, or music industry service providers
contact BandMix (including messages to our help desk email support@BandMix.com); and
participate in public forums, promotions, surveys, or other interactive experiences on the Website.
BandMix also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the Website, as explained in the section below titled Cookies and Tracking Technologies.
BandMix requires the following limited categories of Personal Information in order to provide you with the Services:
name and username
email address
gender
age
city and zip code
IP address
payment information, if applicable
To the extent that BandMix associates the information that BandMix collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on Personal Information in your account profile.
You may voluntarily choose to share additional Personal Information on the Website, for example:
in your account profile (such as phone numbers to receive SMS notifications, images, links to videos, musical interests, and other information);
when starting a profile through Facebook (in which case we will ask for your Facebook email and location, which users may later change in their profile); or
when participating in a discussion on the Website's forum.
Your viewable profile by default does not include any identifying information about you, except the username you chose upon registering. BandMix encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing additional Personal Information on the Website. (If you later choose to delete your account, deletion of your Personal Information will be subject to the process and limits outlined below.)
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
Our legal basis for collecting, processing and using the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.
We may process your Personal Information because:
We need to perform a contract with you, if you have opted for a paid account;
You have given us consent to do so, such as by opting in to receive our newsletters;
The processing is in our vital or legitimate interests, such as our interest in marketing our services, and it's not overridden by your rights; or
To comply with applicable law
YOUR RIGHTS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information. You can access your Personal Information provided in your profile and confirm that it remains correct and up-to-date or choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us by visitng the Website and logging into your user account.

Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain your Personal Information. Please also note that certain Personal Information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation.
When you contact us with a request, we may ask that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.
