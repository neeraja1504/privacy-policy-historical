Privacy Policy – BANNED IN HOLLYWOOD
Privacy Policy
Effective Date:  February 7, 2016
This Privacy Policy explains how Bannedinhollywood and its subsidiaries ( “Bannedinhollywood” ) collect, use, and disclose information, and your choices for managing your information preferences.
What This Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes Bannedinhollywood’s data practices associated with our corporate website (www.Bannedinhollywood.com) and Bannedinhollywood services ( “Services” ), and the choices that Bannedinhollywood provides in connection with our collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy is intended for both website publisher customers ( “Publishers” ) and individual users of websites and apps. For Publishers, this Policy explains how Bannedinhollywood may collect, use and disclose information associated with your company and with your company’s websites and apps that use Bannedinhollywood Services. For individual website and app users, this Privacy Policy explains how Bannedinhollywood may collect, use, and disclose information when you visit our website or when you use any website or app that uses Bannedinhollywood Services.
Bannedinhollywood Services include our Ad Exchange, a Web-based marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile advertising and ad inventory. Bannedinhollywood also offers services, such as our Ad Server, through which we act as a service provider to enable our Publishers, advertisers, ad networks, and other clients to manage their advertising inventory and to collect and use data to provide advertising on their digital and mobile properties and across the Internet. In this case, Publishers may use our services to process data, which they collect or source. Publishers and other clients may also have their own policies that govern how they collect, use, and share data. These policies may differ from Bannedinhollywood’s policies described in this Privacy Policy. Please consult the privacy policies of the websites you visit and apps you use to become familiar with their privacy practices and to learn about any choices that these companies may offer with respect to their information practices.
Finally, the Bannedinhollywood website may contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.
Information Collection and Use
Bannedinhollywood collects contact information through our website when you choose to provide it, such as your name, username, or email address. For example, you may be asked to provide us with contact information when you register with the Bannedinhollywood website and when you purchase the Services. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the Bannedinhollywood website. In order to make payments owed to Publishers, Bannedinhollywood may also request additional information from Publishers such as other contact information and billing account information.
Bannedinhollywood uses this contact and billing information to operate and improve our website and Services, such as to provide notices about your Service, to fulfill your service requests, or to request your feedback or conduct research. Bannedinhollywood also uses contact information to send you information about new products or Services; where Bannedinhollywood needs your permission to do this, we only send such information in accordance with any permissions granted.
We may also collect additional information through our website and Services, such as the following:
‘Free form’ demographic information (e.g. age, gender, marital status)
Browser information (e.g. URL, browser type, ‘click through’ data)
Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g. size/type of ad, ad impressions, location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad)
Device-type information (e.g. screen dimensions, device brand and model)
Unique identification numbers (e.g. IP address and mobile/cell phone device ID)
Location data (as derived from IP address or GPS (for mobile))
Interest segments (i.e. inferred information on the behavior or likely interests associated with a device)
Retargeting data (i.e. data revealing previous interest in a product or website)
Information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices
With respect to data collected via the Bannedinhollywood Ad Exchange, we may combine information that does not directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources and disclose the combined information to participating publishers, advertisers and ad networks so that they can determine whether to bid on ad inventory and in order to improve the relevance of the advertising presented to users. We also use the information we collect to host, operate, maintain, secure, and further develop and improve our Services, such as to keep track of advertising delivery and to measure the effectiveness of advertising delivered through our Services, and investigate compliance with Bannedinhollywood’s policies and terms and conditions.

As discussed above, the Bannedinhollywood Ad Exchange uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Ad Exchange advertisers the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device. These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time. This is called “interest-based advertising.” In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the Bannedinhollywood website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.
