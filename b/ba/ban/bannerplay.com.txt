Last modified: March 1, 2015
Banner Play Ltd. (“we, our or us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit the bannerplay.com site (the “Site”) and when you use any part of our service or software via our Site or on the websites of our partners or other third parties (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site or offered by us through the Service, or that we collect on your behalf as part of the Service.
This Privacy Policy may be amended or updated from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of these changes on our website and in this Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
1. Information Collection
Personally Identifiable Information.
In the course of using the Services, we will ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, country of residence, email address, financial information, and website address.
Non Personally Identifiable Information.
When you access the Site or use the Service, (whether such use is performed on the Site or on a website of one of our partners or other third parties), we collect the following:
Information regarding your use of the Service, including without limitation, the subject of your query, the search engines that you use and all information collected by us in performing the Service for you (“Analytical Data”);
Information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site and information you search for on the Site;
When you use a widget or any other tool offered by us, whether on the Site or on a third party website, including a website owned or operated by you, we may record data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget or tool and any other account related data;
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. Click here to remove our cookie from your browser.
Third party websites which may advertise on the Site and other third parties that you interact with through your use of the Service may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser, which enables them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements and content. The collection and use of such information and access of any third party websites are subject to such third party’s privacy policy.
Usage of Data
We use the anonymous information collected to customize the advertisements you see on participating websites and to analyze if the advertising resulted in a desired action such as sales. This is often referred to as behavioral targeting. In order to serve you appropriate ads, we will temporarily assemble non personal, behavioral, and technical information to create very large audience segments. These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous groupings.
An example of this usage is listed below:
You visit movie-theater content sites in the network of our partner sites, and a cookie is stored on your computer. This data allows us to place you into the “moviegoer” segment. This segmentation is anonymous and does not include any PII about you. The segment data would then be used to show an advertisement for a new movie launch, for example, to you when you visit another website in our network. Segment assignments may change over time as new web-surfing data is collected and used. We then use this segmentation to report on advertising delivery and effectiveness to the advertiser.
Information Collected From Others
We and our licensors allow you to place certain scripts and code which it has developed for installation and use on your website, so that certain BannerPlay applications can be used and accessed by visitors to your website. If you install and deploy an application made available by us, such as a widget (the “Application”), on a website and/or provide the Application for a third party to place on their website or social networking site web page, we may collect on your behalf certain tracking and usage data generated or provided by users (“End Users”) of the Application (“Usage Data”). This information includes general Application usage patterns, Analytical Data with respect to searches conducted through the Application, Log Data from users of your website and other information and statistics regarding your website or the domain in which the Application is located. You may also request that we receive or gather personally identifiable information as part of that Usage Data, including but not limited to email addresses of End Users. Other than as necessary to provide you with the Services and subject always to the express consent of an End User, we will not review, access, share or disclose Usage Data.
Affiliated Sites
We offer and provide access to the Service in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in order to deliver the Service. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.
Links
We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.
Third Party Sites
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. We do not exercise control over the sites that provide administration of the Site and the Service (including without limitation bill and credit card payment processing, ranking or other information), or over banners, other advertisements or links from within the Site or the Service. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information that you submit. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms of the other websites before using their services.
2. Our Policy Toward Children
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@bannerplay.com.
