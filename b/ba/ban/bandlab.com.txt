Furthermore, you hereby agree not to transmit any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or profane material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or violate any law.
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address and other website usage data may be collected and used to gather broad demographic information.

We use user IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, and track user movement for aggregate use.
