About us
BANK Fashion Ltd, for the purposes of the information which you provide to us, acts as the data controller. This means that we are responsible for what happens to the information that you give to us.  We will at all times comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and make sure that we keep your data secure and steps are taken to prevent any unauthorised access to your information.
What data do we collect?
We collect all of the information which you submit to us. For example, when you sign up to receive our newsletter or when you communicate with us in any way (for example, email, Facebook, Twitter or in one of our stores).  This information will include any passwords, usernames, contact details, account details, preferences, interests and details of any complaints you may have made. We will also collect information when you buy from us on our website or in one of our stores. This will include the time and date of your purchase, the goods you purchased and details of any relevant payment card you used.
From time to time we may access publically available information about you on the internet to assist in fraud prevention, for identity verification (such as to confirm we have the correct address details for you) and for marketing purposes, as set out in more detail below.
We also look at your activity on our website, for example what device you're using and what products you're looking at. Much of this information is collected by cookies. For full details, have a look at our cookie policy.
What do we do with your data?
We use your data to fulfil any orders you place with us. We also share your data with third party service providers who help us to do this and to generally operate our business effectively. For example, to help improve the level of service which we provide to you, your data may be shared with third party, independent review websites such as Trustpilot and Feefo. If you want to provide us with feedback on your experience, such third parties may contact you via email to give you the option to do this. You can always leave your feedback anonymously, if you would prefer.
We also use your data for marketing purposes which may mean that you will receive marketing communications from us or carefully selected third parties. However if you do receive marketing communications from other companies, we will endeavour to ensure that the company in question and its products will be as relevant to you as possible.
How do I manage my data and what you do with it?
We always give you the choice of whether or not you wish to continue receiving marketing communications from us. By clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link in a promotional email or by contacting us at customer.services@bankfashion.co.uk,  your details will be removed from our mailing list.
