Bandung-Flasher Forum uses PayPal, a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the Bandung-Flasher store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a membership from the Bandung-Flasher store, PayPal provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Bandung-Flasher Forum. Bandung-Flasher Forum uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, Bandung-Flasher Forum uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by Bandung-Flasher Forum
PayPal requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on the PayPal web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Your credit card information does not pass through the PayPal sites under the terms of Bandung-Flasher Forumâ€™s agreement with PayPal. PayPal does not share credit card information with Bandung-Flasher Forum. PayPal keeps your credit card information confidential and protects your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology.
