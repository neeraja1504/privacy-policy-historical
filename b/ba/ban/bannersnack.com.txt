Thank you for visiting Bannersnack network site and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is simple: we will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit the site unless you choose to provide that information. This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from Bannersnack.
We do not collect nor distribute private data such as credit card numbers at all. Some personal information is recorded for Bannersnack account purposes. All passwords are non-reversible encrypted (MD5) before being saved to the data base, to ensure that they (and your personal information) cannot be stolen from us, even in case of a hacking attack. We do not collect any passwords at all for users that are connecting using the Facebook Connect API as well as for those connecting with Twitter, Google and Yahoo APIs.

What Information Do We Gather?
When you visit our site, we track information including the domain name and the name of the web page from which you entered our site, and how much time you spend on each of our pages. We also collect information that is combined with other web visitors' information, such as how many times visitors click on each web page and the methods by which our site was found. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We may collect IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our site via the use of "cookies."
Cookies: A cookie is a small file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer ready for future access when you return to our site. We use cookies to deliver web content specific to you and to keep track of your online order activity. Cookies cannot pass viruses, harm your computer or pass on private information such as an email address without the computer user's intervention. Cookies contain session identification numbers that allow our systems to recall previous sessions for authentication efforts and assemble information from our gathered data. You can configure your computer's browser to alert you when a site is attempting to send you a cookie and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie. In addition to cookies, we may use small bits of computer code called "one-pixel GIFs," "clear GIFs," or "web beacons" embedded in web pages to monitor website activity. We use this collected electronic data to better design our site. We also collect statistical data on how our apps are used and the banners, widgets and websites created with our apps. Additionally, we track information on all banners that run through Bannersnack Ad Campaigns.
What Do We Do With the Information We Collect?
We reserve the right to use the data collected on our apps, rotators and banners (including those that run through Bannersnack Ad Campaigns) for commercial purposes. You may be asked to provide personal information in certain fields on our site. The personal information we collect is used only for the purpose we state at the time of collection.
The site does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse the site and request pages from our servers unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information to us. This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the site unless you:
access the site from a link in an email that we have sent to you;
have created a profile and you either log-in to your account or choose to be remembered via your cookie, including on your web-enabled mobile device.
In these cases we will know who you are based on the information you previously supplied to us. When you request a page from our site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. We collect the HTTP request header information in order to make our site function correctly and provide you the functionality that you expect to see. We also use this information to personalize content presented to you, better understand how visitors use our site and how we can better tune it, its contents, and functionality to meet your needs.
You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your Internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce functionality of Bannersnack and may mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found on www.allaboutcookies.org under the 'manage cookies' section. Alternatively, you can access further information by going to the help menu within your Internet browser. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
We use multiple Google products (like Google Analytics, Google+, Google Wallet, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, Google AdWords) throughout our sites, iframe embed codes and most of our tools. Therefore we inform you that Google does collect information on it's own. Here is a link to Google's Privacy Policy page: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ where you'll also find more information on how to opt out of being tracked by Google.
Also please note that our products connect with Google advertising solutions therefore we collect information about you and your users throughout Google advertising services using cookies. Here is a link to Google Advertising Policy and how to opt out: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.
We also inform you that you should include the link above in your own privacy policy if you’re using our iframes and banner ads on your website.

Business Transfers
While we do not anticipate it, every business nowadays should plan for the possibility that it might sell certain or all of its assets to another company or individual, or that it might buy certain assets of another company or individual.
