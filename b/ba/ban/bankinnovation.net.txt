Online Legal, Privacy and Information Usage Terms | Royal Media
[Updated as of December 6, 2018]
Royal Media provides market knowledge in several industry sectors through its publications, conferences and custom media products. These online legal, privacy and information usage terms (collectively, “Terms of Use”) reflect our commitment to serve you and explains how we intend to protect your privacy. These Terms of Use cover Royal Media’s treatment of information we collect when you are on our site and when you use our services. These Terms of Use also cover our treatment of any personally identifiable information our business partners share with us. These Terms of Use do not apply to the practices of companies Royal Media does not own or control, including operators of sites to which you may link from the Royal Media website. Royal Media has created these Terms of Use to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information we collect and how we use it.
Lawful Basis for Collection and Processing of Information :
We take your privacy seriously and will only use personal data to provide the products and services you have requested from us. We only collect and process personal information where we have a lawful basis for doing so, such as the following:
User consent –  This is where you have given us explicit permission to obtain and process personal information for a given purpose.
Legitimate business purposes –  This is where we have a legitimate interest, as a business, to process personal information, such where the user is a client of Royal Media or for the purpose of fraud prevention or ensuring network security. We take due care to balance our interests against your right to privacy.
Contractual necessity –  This is where we have to process personal information to meet our contractual obligations. For example, if you are a print subscriber, we would need to process your delivery address to fulfill your subscription.
Legal obligation –  This is where we have to process personal information in order to comply with applicable law.
Withdrawal of Consent to Use or Processing of Information:
To the extent that the legal basis for Royal Media’s use or processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us, as provided below. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of information processing before the withdrawal. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.
COOKIES POLICY
Use of Cookies; Tracking Activity on Our Website
We have developed this Cookies Policy in order to explain how we use cookies and similar technologies (referred to together as “cookies”) on this website and to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information.
Cookies are small text files containing user IDs that are automatically placed on your computer or other device by when you visit a website. The cookies are stored by the internet browser. The browser sends the cookies back to the website on each subsequent visit, allowing the website to recognize your computer or device. This recognition enables the website provider to observe your activity on the website, deliver a personalized, responsive service and improve the website.
The first time that you visit our website, we notify you about our use of cookies through a notification banner. By continuing to use the website, you consent to our use of cookies as described in this Cookies Policy. However, you can choose whether or not to continue accepting cookies at any later time. Information on how to manage cookies is set out later in this Cookies Policy.
When you browse royalmedia.com and have not registered for any online service from Royal Media, personally identifiable information—such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address—is not collected.
However, we track how our site is used by both visitors and our registered customers. One way we track is by using cookies. Cookies collect information that includes the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you responded to a Royal Media banner ad from outside our site or through an e-mail link. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address or any other personally identifiable information.
Using cookies enables us to recognize your computer if you or someone else using your computer returns to our site, and to keep track of the pages on our site that you or another user of your computer visit, and whether or not you or another user of your computer respond to certain banner ads or special offers. We use this information to help us present more relevant offers and information.
You can adjust your computer browser settings so that you are informed when a cookie is being placed on your browser. You can also set your browser to decline or accept all cookies. However, if you choose to register for an online service on royalmedia.com, you must accept cookies in order to access Royal Media site pages that enable you to view your confidential account information. These cookies are essential for site administration and security.

Session Cookies expire after a browser session and are therefore not stored on your computer or device afterward.
