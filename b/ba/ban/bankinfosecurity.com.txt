What to Do When Uncle Sam Wants Your Data
Submitted by krodriguez on 05/03/2004 - 05:42  |  Information Security Program | Patriot Act
The government's hunger for data represents a profound about-face in how law enforcement operates. Before the terrorist attacks, when a crime occurred, investigators would work to determine the perpetrator's identity, and then they would try to dig up as much information about the suspect as possible. Collect, then convict. Today, the new attitude is detect and deter. The FBI is now wading through enormous amounts of data looking for activity that could indicate a terrorist plot or crime.  more

In a perfect world, corporate laptops and desktops would be outfitted with only authorized software that was appropriately configured, always up to date and patched, and protected by layers of security.
What's far more likely is that corporate laptops and desktops include outdated, misconfigured and even unapproved applications.
Because many of these popular programs include spyware, use of such utilities and programs is against corporate policy and a security risk to the organization.  more
