Use of Facebook social plugins & Facebook Re / Marketing Features
We use facebook social plugins to enhance our services. The plugins are usually recognizable by one of the Facebook logos (eg "f" on a blue tile or a "thumbs up" sign)
Within our online offer are "Facebook pixels" and "App Analytics" functions (collectively referred to as "Facebook Re / Marketing Features") of the social network Facebook. With these functions, Facebook is able to target our visitors for the presentation of advertisements, so-called "Facebook Ads". Accordingly, we use Facebook Re / Marketing features to display the Facebook Ads we submit only to Facebook users as well as those Facebook users who might be interested in similar features (so-called "Lookalike Audiences"). This helps in keeping the Facebook Ads in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying. We can also track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing if users have been redirected to our site after clicking on a Facebook ad.
The data collected about you are anonymous to us, so do not give us any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible. The processing of the data by Facebook is part of Facebook's data usage policy.

You may object and disable these functions by following the instructions on the usage-based advertising settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads or the contradiction on the page http://www.aboutads.info / choices or the EU side http://www.youronlinechoices.com explain.
