Privacy Policy Statement
Information We Gather.
We collect both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable information is categorized as General Tracking Information and Click Path Tracking, as further described below.

We use both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected through this website to learn more about how our visitors use this website and to measure areas of interest. This allows us to build features and functionality that will enhance your experience.

Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our website by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users. This information does not identify you personally.

Is the information I am sending really going to Zigi NY?
Our web provider for the web store is Virid. They obtained a digital security certificate for BakersShoes.com.
