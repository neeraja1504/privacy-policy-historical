Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information
We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes. You may opt out from:

In your request to us, please provide your name, identify the form(s) of marketing communications that you no longer wish to receive, and include the address(es) to which it/they are sent.

You may also opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by visiting the Service to update your online profile. In addition, you may opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in any such message.

Do Not Track signals
Web browser Do Not Track (DNT) settings are not enabled on the Sites. Therefore, no action will be taken with respect to "do-not-track" configurations in your Internet browser. By default, you will receive a personalised experience while browsing our website.
Ad choices
The majority of advertisements on our Sites is served to you on our behalf by our third-party ad-serving contractor Doubleclick. However, we do allow third parties (such as advertisers, ad agencies, and ad networks) to serve some of the advertisements on our Sites. Please remember that BabyCenter does not have access to, or control over, the placement of cookies or other tracking mechanisms that these third parties may use or the information these third parties may collect. Such third parties may use cookies that have been placed on your computer to gather information about you and understand the types of pages visited by you and content that you view on our Sites and other websites. These third parties may associate your browser with relevant interest categories and use these categories to show you interest-based advertisements. For example, if you frequently visit travel websites, they may direct to you ads related to travel.
You do have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our website. Many, but not all, third parties engaged in interest-based advertising participate in an industry-wide self-regulatory program that has developed consumer-friendly standards for interest-based advertising. You can opt out of interest-based advertising offered by participating third parties. With respect to third parties that do not participate in this program, they may or may not offer a mechanism for opting out of interest-based advertising.
In addition to the foregoing, you can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of the Sites might not work without certain cookies.
California privacy rights
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by BabyCenter L.L.C. to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please submit a request to our customer service team. Please allow thirty (30) days after receipt of your request for a response to be provided.
Cross-border transfer
Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or service providers. And by using our Service or by providing consent to us (where required by law), your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country. Appropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect personal information when it is transferred to our affiliates or third parties in other countries.
Some non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries are recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have ensured that adequate measures are in place, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by [EU Standard Contractual Clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield Certification, or an EU-approved code of conduct or certification], to protect your personal information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting our data protection officer in accordance with the "Contacting us" section below.
Security
We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect personal information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the "Contacting us" section below.
Retention period
We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Service to you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).
