To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and surveys ("Special Promotions"), or to make online purchases ("Purchases"), you will need to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information may be collected by Bauble Box or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, a Special Promotion, a complimentary service offering, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.
If you make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion on one of our sites, through our Services, or on or through a site or service of third parties we refer you to, Bauble Box will collect your personally identifiable information, and you are deemed to consent to us providing your information to third parties who provide certain services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, or complimentary service offerings, as applicable. (As more fully described below in Section XII, these third parties may use this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.). Also, by entering a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.
If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which Bauble Box is participating on a third party's website (or through some other means or medium), we will collect your information from the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to your activity (e.g., to send your order or deliver a prize).

Likewise, if you use our services, or provide information to other companies who share information about their customers, we may collect additional information about you. In each of these cases, Bauble Box will apply this policy to any personally identifiable information.
VII. Information About Other People
Some Bauble Box Websites and Services may ask you to submit personally identifiable information about other people.
