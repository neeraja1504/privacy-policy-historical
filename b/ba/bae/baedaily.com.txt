For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information obtained through your use of the Site, the Direct Focus Online and/or entry into a Promotion, which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you. The Personally Identifiable Information that you must submit in order to register as an Advertiser or Publisher, or to enter into a Promotion, may include, without limitation, your name, title, company name, mailing/billing address, email address, telephone number, Skype name, credit card information and/or bank account information.

Please be advised that we may retain and use your Personally Identifiable Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. In addition, after you delete your Personally Identifiable Information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. This deletion will not change or delete Personally Identifiable Information which may have already been shared with third parties, as permitted in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact the third parties that contact you directly to change your preferences regarding their use of your Personally Identifiable Information.

Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Setting of Digital Identifiers
Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. To disable and reject certain cookies, follow the instructions associated with your Internet browser. Even in the case where a user rejects a cookie, he or she may still use the Site.
We automatically use Digital Identifiers (as defined below) for tracking transactions, identification, security and the user characteristics as set forth herein. No Personally Identifiable Information is collected by use of digital identifiers and we use the information collected through such Digital Identifiers, which may also include information about the precise geographic location of the device, which may be collected when the user of the device permits such collection, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track movements on the Site and gather aggregate demographic information, about visitors so we can continually improve the Site, our performance network, in order to buy and sell online advertising, including interest-based advertising, using Real-Time Bidding and our other products and services.
Real-Time Bidding: Are complex technological tools or platforms that enable advertising buyers to bid in “real time” for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded or an app is used.
We also employ, and our third-party advertising partners employ, Digital Identifiers that help us better manage content and/or track transactions, collect data, serve advertising and provide related services. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, we do not tie the information gathered by Digital Identifiers to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.
Glossary:
Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above). The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Non-Cookie Technology: Today’s online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology. As such, cookies are not always available. Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices. For example, some platforms, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising. Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices. Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.
We also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personally Identifiable Information.
Without deviating from the terms set forth above, including with respect to potential use of Non-Cookie Technology, the Direct Focus Group uses the following: (a) unique cookies to identify web browsers and to store data for advertising purposes, including interest-based advertising; (b) unique cookies to track users’ responses (clicks and conversions) to ads purchased; (c) non-unique cookies to store users’ opt-out choices.
Please note the digital identifiers on the Site may change periodically and we will update this preference manager accordingly to have the most up to date digital identifiers included in this tool.
Behavioral Tracking
Direct Focus Online uses cookies, pixels and other tracking technology on the Site for purposes of tracking users’ activities after they leave the Site. Direct Focus Online uses these tracking technologies to target applicable users with advertisements regarding Direct Focus Online products and services, and other products and/or services that Direct Focus Online thinks may be of interest to applicable users. In addition, third parties such as Google® may engage in a similar form of behavioral tracking of users that visit the Site. Users may be able to disable some, but not all, of this tracking activity by utilizing the “Do Not Track” setting or similar options within most major Internet browsers. In addition, if you would prefer to not receive targeted ads from us or from the partners that use our services, please follow the instructions at the end of the applicable marketing message or email us at: privacy@baedaily.com.
