1. INTRODUCTION
Ball Ball , owned and operated by NWS Digital Asia Pte. Limited (collectively, “ Ball Ball ,” “our” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “Services”).
A list of our affiliated companies (“Company Affiliates”) is available at News Corp.
As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Company Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years of age.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Service and those who have registered with or subscribe to a Service. This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).
By using the Services, you expressly consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information by Ball Ball in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and your continued use of the Services will be deemed to be consent by you to the same.
2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
We and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:
Registration Information is the information you submit to register for a Service, for example, to create an account or receive alerts. Registration Information may include, for example, name and email address.
Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to a Service through a social media service or connect a Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Ball Ball Services through social media services or when you connect a Service to social media services, you consent to the collection, storage, use and/or disclosure of such information and content by Ball Ball in accordance with this Privacy Policy. __
Activity Information. When you access and interact with the Ball Ball Services, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.
Third parties that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Ball Ball does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.

6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Updates to Privacy Policy. We may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services.
Location of Data. The Services are managed from Singapore. Where personal information is used or processed outside of Singapore, Ball Ball will ensure that the entity receiving the personal information provides a standard of protection that is comparable to the protection under the Personal Data Protection Act in Singapore (“PDPA”). As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.
Linked Services. The Services may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, alerts, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Ball Ball is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.
Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.
Data Retention. We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or until it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which that personal information was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal information and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.
Sensitive Information. We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Ball Ball Services or otherwise.
Accuracy
If your personal information is likely to be used by us to make a decision that affects you, or is likely to be disclosed by us to another organization, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information collected by us or on our behalf is accurate and complete. However, our ability to meet this obligation will depend largely on you having provided us with personal information that is accurate and complete.
Access to Policies and Practices
Upon your request, we will make available to you information about the policies and practices implemented by us regarding personal data protection and our complaints handling process.
