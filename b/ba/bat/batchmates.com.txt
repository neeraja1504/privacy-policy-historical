Privacy Policy of Batchmates.com
Batchmates.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices. For additional information about Batchmates.com, please review our Terms of Service.
Batchmates.com does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties. Batchmates.com does provide your personal identification to selected, affiliated companies to allow them to perform services for members on our behalf.
Email
It is the policy of Batchmates.com to send our members only the types of email they elect to receive in addition to Batchmates.com customary business communications (address confirmation, renewal notifications, new product offerings, etc.). Further, it is our policy to remove members from any Batchmates.com mailing list to which they have subscribed upon request (members will continue to receive customary business communications from Batchmates.com). At any time, members can update their email preferences list via the "My Page" button. In addition, every subscribed email communication from Batchmates.com will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.
Membership Registration
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at Batchmates.com, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze members information in aggregate- that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to Batchmates.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual member. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you.
Batchmates.com may periodically conduct individual voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer, and how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in online surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs- so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want.

If we change our privacy policy, we will prominently post a link to those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner, and we will then use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
What about Security of your personal information?
Batchmates.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/ order process asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry- SSL. This is done by our payment gateway partner.
While we or our payment gateway partners use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us.
What about Email Choice/ Opt-out?
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the email or by logging-in and changing their email options in the My Page section of the site.
