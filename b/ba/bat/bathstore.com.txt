We utilize stringent security precautions to make our website safe, including the utilization of a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server across all our pages. Any information you enter while you're utilizing the secure server is encrypted before being transmitted.
You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock icon or an image of a padlock in the address bar. Normally sites only secure pages like the checkout however we secure every page of our website to give enhanced security. This is easily identifiable as the address will start with https: - the ‘s’ indicating it is a secure page.
The latest versions of the most popular browsers, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Firefox support this secure connection.

13. Cookies/tracking and links
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree (or your browser agrees automatically if you have set it up in that way), your browser adds that text in a small file. A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets web site operators know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easier to shop, by allowing you to place things into a shopping basket; the basket itself is not a cookie; the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your basket versus others in use at the same time.
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our web site in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes. Denial of a traffic log cookie may prevent you from using the web site. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit to you and us from their proper use is worthwhile. You may set up your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely (although declining them may prevent you from being able to use the web site properly or at all). You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your Internet browser.
