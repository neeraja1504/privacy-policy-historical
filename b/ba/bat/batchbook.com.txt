Privacy Statement | Batchbook
BatchBlue Software has created this privacy statement (“Statement”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the BatchBlue Software web site (the “Site”) is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.
Information We Collect
A. Information you provide to us: We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the “Service”) to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in obtaining additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked.
B. Hosted and stored Batchbook accounts. When you create or upload your Batchbook account (the “Data”), we have access to the Data in your account.
C. Other Information we receive and store. When you register to use Batchbook, we store “cookies”, which are strings of code, on your computer and they are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to BatchBlue Software, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering, you remain anonymous to BatchBlue Software. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you’ve closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.
BatchBlue Software uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows BatchBlue Software to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you’ve logged in and are required in order to use the BatchBlue Software application. BatchBlue Software uses persistent cookies, which only BatchBlue Software can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a BatchBlue Software customer or prior BatchBlue Software Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.
D. Tracking Cookies or Third Party Cookies. We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies, web beacons or other automated technologies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally identifiable information. All data collected by such third parties on behalf of BatchBlue Software is used only to provide us with aggregate information on site usage. Specifically, BatchBlue partners with Google Analytics to provide us with information on site usage. Google Analytics’ terms are available here: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. If you have a concern regarding the use of Google Analytics, you should consult the Google Analytics terms, as BatchBlue has no ability to control or monitor our data analytics partners’ data collection or data use practices.
E. Other Information. BatchBlue Software may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
