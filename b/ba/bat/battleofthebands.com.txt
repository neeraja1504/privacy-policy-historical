11. Additional Information
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of our operations, we gather certain types of information about www.battleofthebands.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.
1. Information Collected
We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on Battle Of The Bands, for example how many users log into Battle of the Bands on a daily basis).
2. Personal Data
Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to us, for example to become a fan of a particular artist, or other membership services, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by Ernie Ball or the sponsors of such contests and promotional opportunities. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and comment sections.
3. Aggregated Information
Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, Ernie Ball collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from us, our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on Battle of the Bands
4. Use of Cookies
We also use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure activity on the www.battleofthebands.com site ("Site") and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by us to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policies.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as the member-only areas, voting areas, and communication areas, will not function properly if you do so.

5. Use of Information Collected
Ernie Ball uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, any content you submit to the Site (images, voting, comments, etc.) will be publicly available.

Ernie Ball may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if Ernie Ball believes that any user has committed unlawful acts or acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, Ernie Ball may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site and to other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this Site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, Ernie Ball may share with such companies Web site usage information about visitors to the Sites for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising sponsors note some of the pages you visit on our sites through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).
