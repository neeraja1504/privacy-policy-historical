Purpose and relevance
1. Processing your order
When you order something at Bax Music, we need your personal data to process and deliver your order. We also need this information in case you want to return a product to us or have it repaired. For these reasons, we need to know your name, your gender, your address details (for delivery and invoicing), your telephone number, your email address and your payment details which includes things like your IBAN/account number, the account name and your credit card number.

Your personal data is required in order for Bax Music to create a sales agreement for you. We are legally obliged to keep this information for 7 years.

Bax Music gives customers the possibility to create a webshop account which involves storing personal information like your name, your address details (for delivery and invoicing), your telephone number, your email address, your customer number and your user name and password.
In order to make your shopping experience as easy as possible, your account details are automatically linked to your orders so that you can easily arrange returns, add products to your wishlist, and subscribe to our newsletters or loyalty program. It's also possible to link your webshop account to your social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.
We save your account details to give you easy access and a seamless shopping experience in our webshop.
3. Visiting one of our shops
All of our shops are constantly monitored by video cameras for security purposes. Images are stored for a period of 3 months and can be used in the event of suspected theft or fraud. They also ensure the safety of customers and employees by reducing the chance of threats, or aggressive or violent behaviour.
4. Contact with Customer service department
Our customer service department is there to answer any questions you may have or offer advice on products you may wish to purchase. They can be contacted in various ways including by email, by telephone, through the website or through social media channels like Facebook and Twitter. In order to help you as quickly as possible, we store your contact information and your calls as long as you are a customer with us or you have a webshop account with us.
Your telephone conversation with our customer service team can be recorded for quality and training purposes and we use these to improve our services. In addition, these telephone recordings can be used when investigating suspected theft or fraud and as evidence. Phone recordings are destroyed after a period of 1 year.

7. Optimal online shopping experience
