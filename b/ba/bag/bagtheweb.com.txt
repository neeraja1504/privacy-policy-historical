Your privacy is critically important to us. At BagTheWeb we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
In our bagging service, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to permanently delete any content.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
BagTheWeb Inc. (“BagTheWeb”) operates several websites including www.bagtheweb.com and ambiently.com. It is BagTheWeb policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, BagTheWeb collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BagTheWeb’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BagTheWeb’s visitors use its website. From time to time, BagTheWeb may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
BagTheWeb also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. BagTheWeb does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to BagTheWeb’s websites choose to interact with BagTheWeb in ways that require BagTheWeb to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BagTheWeb gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at www.bagtheweb.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, BagTheWeb collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with BagTheWeb. BagTheWeb does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
BagTheWeb may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, BagTheWeb may monitor the most popular bags on the BagTheWeb.com site. BagTheWeb may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, BagTheWeb does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
BagTheWeb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BagTheWeb’s behalf or to provide services available at BagTheWeb’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using BagTheWeb’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BagTheWeb will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, BagTheWeb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when BagTheWeb believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BagTheWeb, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a BagTheWeb website and have supplied your email address, BagTheWeb may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with BagTheWeb and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. BagTheWeb takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
