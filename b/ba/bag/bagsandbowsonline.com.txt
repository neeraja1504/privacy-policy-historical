Information Collection & Use
We use the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, and future promotions. For the purposes of order verification and fraud prevention, we may exchange information about our customers internally within Bags & Bows and among our affiliates.
The type of information we collect, use, or share may depend on the product or service you have purchased from us. At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply identifying information for purposes such as receiving correspondence, registering on this web site, making purchases, or participating in online surveys, market research or contests/sweepstakes. If you elect to participate, we may require you to provide business information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, financial institution information, credit card information, or e-mail address. In certain areas of Bags & Bows sites, you may provide employee information such as when adding additional authorized users to your business account and updating contact information. When you submit business information to us, you understand and agree that we may access, store, and use your information.
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. We may send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.

To have your testimonial removed, please contact Bags & Bows through the methods listed in the “To Correct/Update/Access/Opt Out” section at the end of this Policy.
Information you provide will be safeguarded according to our strict standards of security and confidentiality. Bags & Bows recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of the information you choose to provide.

We take steps to require that our vendors, consultants, suppliers, and contractors observe our Privacy Policy with respect to security and the collection, use, and exchange of our customers' information.
