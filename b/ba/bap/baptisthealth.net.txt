Some of the information that you submit through this Website may be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.).
Passive Information Collection
As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected from the website (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection. Like most webssite operators, Baptist Health tracks IP addresses, use both session and persistent cookies, and assigns Internet tags. Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on this Website and collects operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems, and Internet service providers. We passively collect information from this Website to understand what areas of this Website are most popular, which areas may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by our visitors.

Choices You Have about How Baptist Health Uses your Information top
We strive to provide you with as many choices and as much control as possible regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:
You may send us an e-mail message addressed to the Web Coordinator at corporatepr@baptisthealth.net or call us at 786-596-6534 , to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. To protect your privacy, we will only respond to e-mail messages that you send to us by responding to that same e-mail account unless you provide us with an alternative means to communicate with you. Should you elect to have your information deleted, we will also delete your user account.
If you do not wish us to share your personal information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties, please tell the Web Coordinator at corporatepr@baptisthealth.net. You may also opt out of receiving marketing messages from Baptist Health by notifying us at the same address.
If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly.

How Baptist Health Protects your Information top
We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption which provides a level of security and privacy for all data sent over the Internet. The SSL connection method provides a mechanism for determining whether the data has been altered in transit. Baptist Health also protects information by using an Internet firewall. The Internet firewall is a security mechanism that allows us to restrict access to our network from the Internet, allowing approved traffic in and out according to Baptist Health's thought-out plan.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. If you have access to password-protected features, never share your password with anyone else, notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and remember to log off of this Website before you leave your computer.
