Barry's Tickets - Privacy Policy
When using Barrystickets.comâ€™s basic features, you do not have to divulge any personal information. Some forms will contain optional questions, which help us improve the usefulness of this site. Required fields will always be clearly marked to distinguish them from optional fields.
No individual personal information about you will be shared with anybody, without your permission, and will only be used by Barrystickets.com and its licensed partners for the purpose for which it was collected. If you choose to opt-in on a registration form, or take part in a contest sponsored by a third party, some demographic information may be shared in aggregate form with reputable third parties for advertising purposes (i.e. delivering online ads or taking you to Web sites that best match your interests).
In the event that Barrystickets.com is acquired by or merged with a third party, individual personal information may be transferred to the third party pursuant to such acquisition or merger. If an aquisition or merger does occur you will be notified via email and instructions for removing your registration information will be included in that email.
WE DO NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR EMAIL ADDRESS TO "LIST BROKERS" OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY
How the Information is Used
The special features on our site require the majority of the information we request in order to function properly. Some orders may require contact with another distributor to complete the transfer of your tickets. The other information and optional questions give us additional information about our user base that helps us improve the site.
Who Collects the Information
Any information you submit while registering for Barrystickets.com features or promotions is collected solely by Barry's Ticket Service Inc.
