When placing an order, requesting a quote, or in certain other communications with us, we ask you to provide contact information (including name, shipping address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date, and billing address) (collectively "Personal Information").

Sharing Your Information
We do not sell or trade Personal Information to marketing companies or information brokers. We will only disclose your Personal Information in the following circumstances without first obtaining your consent:
We may provide Personal Information when requested to do so in certain types of legal or law enforcement proceedings.
We may buy or sell business assets or be acquired by or acquire other companies or BarcodesInc institutions. In such transactions, Personal Information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In addition, in the event we merge or consolidate with another institution, your Personal Information may be transferred to the successor BarcodesInc institution.
We may use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our services, and they may have access to Personal Information. For example, we may outsource one or more aspects of our Site to a supplier or service provider who performs services according to our requirements. In these cases we will restrict through written agreements how these suppliers or service providers may use or disclose the Personal Information to which they have access.
Please remember that, although we endeavor to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to customer privacy, we are in no way responsible for the actions or policies of these other organizations.
Use of Cookies
The use of cookies enables us to enhance your visits to the Site. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, but this will limit your ability to use some features. Cookies enable us to recognize your browser and provide features that are tailored to your needs.
We may use information from cookies for purposes of planning and tracking, as well as assessing the technical function of the Site. We may also use cookies to track information about which pages you visit within the Site to help us gauge the effectiveness of the Site or our content.
Security Measures
We work hard to protect the security of your information. Our order processing system protects your Personal Information through the use of Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption. While we strive to protect your information by using SSL and other measures to protect our system, such security cannot be ensured. Consequently, we do not ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. If your communication to us includes confidential information, you may want to contact us by using telephone, fax, or regular mail.
