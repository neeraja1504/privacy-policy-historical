YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
Opting-out of marketing emails
Barbour will periodically send you marketing emails only if you have given your consent using one of our online forms or, for example, if you have entered a Barbour competition (and click the relevant box) . If you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from Barbour you can unsubscribe by clicking on the relevant link in the footer of the email or alternatively you can contact the Barbour team via email at customercare@barbour.com. When marketing emails are sent to you, we may place a small graphic in the footer of your email. This graphic allows us to improve your email experience and make it more tailored to your preferences. The result is that when you open an email and view the images within it, this graphic is downloaded from our server. We will treat your opening of the email as consent to tailor your email preferences in this way.
Where we store your personal data
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, one of our suppliers or one of our subsidiaries such as Barbour Inc. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
