We store this information on secure servers and do not share any of your personal data with anyone else for marketing or research purposes.
When you make a purchase with us, we use a third party payment processor, SagePay, to handle all of our credit and debit card transactions. As you progress through our checkout process, you will be forwarded to the SagePay secure payment portal to enter your card details. Those card details are handled solely by SagePay and they do not share your card details with us, only basic information about the authorisation status of your purchase.

Other ways that we interact with you and your data
Our website uses cookies in order to work correctly. Cookies are small text files which we write onto your computer, which allow us to remember your identity when you load and reload new pages of our website. This is necessary in order to be able to put items into your basket and save them as you progress through the purchase process.

Our live chat feature
Our website has an embedded live chat app, which allows you to speak directly to us in our workshop while you browse our site. When you use this feature, you will be asked to provide your name and email address. This is so that we can identify if you have chatted with us before, in case we need to refer to a previous conversation. The app will also read your IP address to tell us where you are located, so that we can provide you with correct shipping and taxation details when discussing product pricing. This information is not used for marketing and supplying your email address to us here does not add you to our mailing list. We may use your email address in order to contact you if your chat gets cut off, or we need to correct any information that we gave to you during your chat with us.

*Cookies*
Bareknucklepickups.co.uk uses cookies to keep track of what you have in your basket and to remember you when you return to our site. To make a purchase online at bareknucklepickups.co.uk you need to have all cookies enabled. If cookies aren't enabled on your computer, it will mean that your shopping experience on our website will be limited to browsing and researching; you won't be able to add products to your basket and buy them.
Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. Most web browsers have cookies enabled. Please note that cookies can't harm your computer. We use encrypted information gathered from them to help improve your experience of the site. For example, they help us to identify and resolve errors, or to determine relevant related products to show you when you're browsing.
Our cookies don't store sensitive information such as your name, address or payment details: they simply hold the 'key' that, once you're signed in, is associated with this information. However, if you'd prefer to restrict, block or delete cookies from bareknucklepickups.co.uk, or any other website, you can use your browser to do this. Each browser is different, so check the 'Help' menu of your particular browser (or your mobile phone's handset manual) to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
“Do Not Track” (DNT) is a feature offered by some browsers, with some newer browsers offering it as default. If you enable it, it sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing isn't tracked, for example by third party ad or social networks, or analytic companies. You can opt out of tracking and analytics.
At present no industry-wide uniform standard has been agreed and adopted to determine how DNT requests should be managed, so our website doesn’t currently respond to DNT requests. Until that standard is established, we'll continue to review DNT and other new technologies, but won't respond to DNT requests.

Shopping safely on bareknucklepickups.co.uk.
We hope you enjoy the ease and convenience of shopping on bareknucklepickups.co.uk. Your confidence in our website and your internet security is really important to us, so we've put together some advice to help keep you safe when you shop.
*Passwords*
We do appreciate that remembering passwords can be tricky, but setting effective and secure passwords on all the sites you use is vital in combating possible fraudulent activity using your personal details.
It's best to avoid using the same password for each of your online accounts, because if a criminal gains access to it, all your accounts could be at risk. Multiple passwords keep you safer.
When you set a password, it's a good idea to use a mix of numbers and characters, and something that's very personal to you. Most sites these days will set a minimum number of characters to use, but do avoid using obvious phrases like “password”, or your name, or phone number. It's a good idea to change your passwords on a regular basis, especially for sites you use frequently and which involve financial transactions.
If you ever get a request to reveal your password for an online site, don't respond as legitimate sites and services won't ask you to send them passwords via email. You may be tempted to share passwords with close family, but do keep in mind there's always a risk they could pass information on inadvertently or share it with someone else.
If you ever forget your password you can change it by logging into your Bare Knuckle account. If you get stuck, just e-mail us, sales@bareknucklepickups.co.uk.
For more information on online safety and passwords, there are a number of useful websites such as Get Safe Online, Microsoft Safety & Security, Google good to know.
*Computer security*
Keep yourself safe from malware and viruses with adequate, up to date security on your computer. You can usually download free basic protection from providers such as AVG and McAfee, but choose what works for you. Keep your software switched on and up to date, and make sure that your Windows operating system has the latest Microsoft updates. It's a good idea to run regular scans on your computer.
When you're opening emails, be careful. Don't click on links to download files or open attachments you haven't asked for, or aren't expecting, as they may contain viruses.
Back up all your files so they're available if the worst happens and your computer is infected by a virus.

*Using WiFi in public places*
Using an unsecured network in a public place can be risky as unauthorised people may try to intercept anything you're doing online. We recommend you only connect to secure wireless networks that you trust, and to always be aware of the risks associated with using public WiFi.
*Phishing*
Phishing is the practice of tricking someone into giving confidential information. Examples include falsely claiming to be a legitimate company when sending an e-mail to a user, in an attempt to get the user to send private information that will be used for identity theft and fraud.
We'll never ask you to send any personal details via email. If we require such details, for security reasons we'll ask you to contact us by phone. Should you receive an email claiming to be from bareknucklepickups.co.uk requesting this kind of information, please don't respond, but do let us know about it.
