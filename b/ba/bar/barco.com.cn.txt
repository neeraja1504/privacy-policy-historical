signing up for email communications
participating in a survey
ordering a product online
logging a ticket for technical questions (“eSupport”)

In these cases, we usually receive information such as your first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number, address details (street, number, postcode, city, country), the project or the region in which you are interested, your position, your correspondence with Barco, your partner types, your market and application segments and other personal and/ or contact details.
