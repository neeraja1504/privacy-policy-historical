Any of your personal information we collect from other sources will be stored and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We maintain your information securely in our customer database and will only store it for a reasonable period of time, which if you have an account with us will be duration of your subscription to our service and for six years thereafter.
Use of Information
This information is used:
to provide the service or product requested;
to enable billing and shipping;
to personalize our service;
to analyze and report on your and other students’ performance;
to provide you with information about related products and services, based on the preferences you have indicated;
to improve our website;
for the development of new products and services; and
for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.
If you have inquired about, applied for, or enrolled in an BARBRI course or scholarship program, we (or one of our group companies) may occasionally update you on our latest policies, products/services, news and special offers via e-mail. At the bottom of any electronic communication you receive from us or one of our group companies, you will have an option to unsubscribe and opt-out of receiving further marketing communications.
Your information may be shared with members of our group and some third-parties. Please note:
We will not share your credit card number with parties outside of our group of companies, or the payment processor.
Basic demographic data including name, address, phone, email, company, title, school, graduation data, course for which you are registered, and related information may be disclosed to marketing partners (including but not limited to Google ‘Adwords’, Facebook ‘Ads’ and LinkedIn ‘Insights’). You can prohibit this using the steps set out in the “How to prohibit sharing to our marketing partners” section.
Information concerning your usage of our site and your progress using our study materials may be disclosed to third parties such as educational institutions, professors, and product development partners. If your company has sponsored your attendance or certification, we will also share progress (started, in progress, completed) course data, and successful certification outcomes.
Our marketing partners and other third-parties who we may share your information with will be required to meet our standards on processing information and security. The information we provide them, including your information, will only be provided in connection with the performance of their function.
Your personal information may be transferred to other third party organizations in certain scenarios:
if we’re discussing selling or transferring part or all of our business – the information may be transferred to prospective purchasers under suitable terms as to confidentiality;
if we are reorganized or sold, information may be transferred to a buyer who can continue to provide services to you;
if we’re required to by law, or under any regulatory code or practice we follow, or if we are asked by any public or regulatory authority – for example the Police; or
if we are defending a legal claim your information may be transferred as required in connection with defending such claim.
Your personal information may be shared if it is made anonymous and aggregated, as in such circumstances the information will cease to be personal data.
Why we use your information
We use the information we collect about you in the manner set out above either because it is necessary to perform the contract between us (providing the products or services ordered from us or opening and maintaining your account with us) or because we have a legitimate business interest. Our legitimate business interests include but are not limited to:
ensuring we continue to improve our service and better understand our users and customers and how you use our website, our apps and our products and services;
ensuring we can communicate with you and you can easily communicate with us and amend your preferences from time-to-time; and
ensuring we develop and maintain strong relationships with our suppliers and partners.
Our marketing partners use your information because they believe they have legitimate business interests to do so as they think you would be interested in hearing from them about similar products and services to those we provide. If you wish to prohibit us sharing your personal information to our marketing partners, please follow the process set out in the “How to prohibit sharing to our marketing partners” section below.
The employer, educational institutions, professors, and product development partners to which we may share your information also use your information on the basis that they have legitimate interests as they process your data to analyze and improve team cohesion, reduce errors, speed onboarding and other improvements, and for the development of new products and services.
