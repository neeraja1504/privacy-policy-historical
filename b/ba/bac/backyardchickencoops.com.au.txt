2.3. Personal Information collected via cookies
Our Services may use small pieces of data called cookies to identify a user who engages with our Website and to compile records of a user's history of engaging with our Website.  Cookies are stored by a users' browser while the user browses a website.  Cookies do not usually contain information that personally identifies a person, but each time the user visits the Website, the browser sends the cookie data back to the server to notify the system of the user's previous activity. If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your browser settings.  Please note that if you disable or limit the cookies on your browser or computer, then you may obstruct the functionality of our Services, including the online shopping functionality.   We also use Google Analytics, which allows us to anonymously track the use of our Website by recording the number of users who have visited, the number of pages viewed, navigation patterns, what systems users have and the date and time of visits through cookies.
