C. Use of Cookies
Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within the site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.
Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value, such as merging into www.backwoodshome.com a site that relies on third-party cookies or serving third-party advertising.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website. You also have the ability to delete cookies at any time.

i. Third-party Advertising
Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information ( not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
ii. Google and DoubleClick
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site(s).
Google’s use of the DoubleClick DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site(s) and other sites on the Internet. The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher’s website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user’s browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help Google better serve ads of interest to visitors and AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy page.
6. USE OF TRACKING CODE, WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES
Backwoods Home Magazine’s Web pages may contain tracking code or electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. may include tracking code or Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
Some of these tracking codes and/or Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These tracking codes and/or Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. prohibits tracking codes and Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
