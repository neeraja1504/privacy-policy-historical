This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified by, and it does not include data that has been anonymized or pseudonymized.
We also address GDPR specific issues such as data retention, deletion requests, what data we and our third party partners gather, and more. Remember that GDPR only is applicable if you are located in the European Union.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at https://backroomcastingcouch.com/free/terms.html, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that personal data should be collected, processed, and retained for no longer than is necessary for the purpose it was obtained for. When we mention any retention periods in this document below, it refers to retention of data from EU subjects only. Please carefully read below what data we collect directly, and what data third party services collect on our behalf, in particular billing companies. For third party data collection, we provide a general overview of their data gathering and use practices, but we can't guarantee this overview is comprehensive. To find out the full extend of their data gathering, storage, and retention practice, please contact each third party service directly.
This policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through other means such as any other website operated by us, or any third party or affiliates.
Log Data
Like almost every other web site, we automatically collect information that your browser sends to us, which is called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser version, pages of this site you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, the site or URL you were on before you came to this site, and other statistics, depending on your browser and the server software. This information is automatically captured by servers, even if you do not become a paying member or otherwise interact with the site. Merely by visiting this site, the servers capture this data and stores it for up to 30 days, longer if required by law. This information is needed to investigate or prevent any hacking or other illegal activities, provide customer service, help us learn how, why, when, and where visitors use this site or portions thereof, and help us allocate the necessary resources to ensure a smooth experience for our members.
This information is stored on the server in log files, which are accessible by the hosting company , as well as the webmaster and support agents of this site via a password protected administration interface on the server.
Transaction and Financial Data
If you become a paying member of this site, additional information will be obtained (“Transaction/Financial Data”) about you, most of which you voluntarily agree to provide, but some may be obtained without your explicit input. During the payment process, a third party payment process ("Biller") will require you to input your name, address, credit card or bank account data, zip code, email address, and other personally identifiable information. They may also automatically capture your IP address and browser information without your input. Exactly what data a Biller captures and what they do with it and for how long depends on the Biller, and you need to contact the Biller's sites to find out more. Please scroll down to the Third Party section for more detailed information, including GDPR-related rights if you are located in the EU, such as what data is used, by whom, and how to request deletion, etc.
This site does not itself host your credit card data, but it does receive your user name and encrypted password and IP address, which are stored in a database. This is required in order for you to be able to log in to the site. Further, the site may obtain any other information you provided to the Billers such as your full name, address, referring URL (the URL that referred you this site, which, if it is a URL or website operated by an affiliate of this site, will be paid for this referral), and IP address, which will be stored in a separate secure database.
All information described above will generally remain in the site's databases or Biller's system indefinitely or until you request deletion of that data, however the actual retention time varies by Biller. Remember that in order for you to be able to log in or receive any support or services, we must have this information.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
GDPR Rights – Additional Granular Information
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers changes to data privacy for any person or company located in the European Union. The purpose is to give subjects greater control over their personal information, including the right to actively consent to every use of personal data and the right to limit that use, as well as “the right to be forgotten”, the right to have their data portable, and the right to seek damages should they suffer from misuse/breach of their data.
As you can see by reading our privacy policy, this site itself only keeps very little personally identifiable data about you, in particular if you only visit the site but don't purchase a membership or use any contact form. The bulk of data is stored by our third parties such as the billing companies, which captures and stores this information from you if you purchase a membership, only some of which they will send to us (user name, encrypted password) - and this is necessary in order for you to have an active membership. When you submit a request to have your data deleted, we will begin deleting your data from servers and systems we have direct control over, and inform third parties such as the billing companies of your request as well. However, it may often be faster and more thorough for you to contact a billing company directly to have them delete your data.
If you are an EU resident and wish to have your data deleted, fill out this form or email privacy@backroomcastingcouch.com with your full name, IP address, and email address you used to sign up or otherwise interact with this site. Please note that once we delete all your data, this will include data you provide via the contact form or email. Therefore we cannot contact you to let you know that this data has been deleted.
If you wish to obtain any personally identifiable data we have of you in an electronically portable format, you may request that at no cost here. You will receive a spreadsheet or text document with any information we have as soon as possible.
Note: we do not respond to requests for deletion or portable data or any other GDPR-related requests from anyone located outside the EU, or otherwise not covered by GDPR. Further, we are not obligated to restrict retention of any data persons not located in the EU or covered by GDPR, and we reserve the right to keep such data for any period we deem necessary, lawful, and prudent.
Do Not Track Policy
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference users can set in most browsers. How you do this depends on your browser. It is not legally required for a site or service to honor this request, and many sites, such as ours, don't have the ability to recognize or respond to any DNT requests. In other words, DNT does not work on this site.
California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code permits users of this site who are California residents to request certain information about the site's disclosure of personal information to third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. You can email privacy@backroomcastingcouch.com to make this request, and to opt-out from disclosure of your information to third parties for marketing purposes. (California residents only).
This affects marketing ONLY. You may still receive relevant account or billing information, or other select offers from the site in accordance with California law.
Legal successor
In the event this sites undergoes a merger, restructuring, buyout, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or other sale or transfer of any or all assets, any personal information held by this site may be among the assets transferred or sold. Should a sale or other described event occur this site will take reasonable steps to ensure that the entity to which this information is transferred uses it in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.
