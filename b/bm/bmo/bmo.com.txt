Our Privacy Code | BMO Financial Group
BMO Financial Group appreciates the opportunity to help you meet your financial needs. From the day Bank of Montreal was founded in 1817, earning and keeping your trust has been at the very core of our business. We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information you have entrusted to us. It is important for you to understand what information we will collect, how we will use it, and who may see it.
This Privacy Code outlines our commitment to you and is designed to comply with applicable Privacy legislation in Canada, which incorporates the following ten (10) principles. Click to expand each section.
Each and every one of our employees is responsible for maintaining and protecting the personal information to which they have access. We have strict policies and procedures for protecting personal information and designated individuals within BMO Financial Group who are responsible for monitoring our compliance.
BMO Financial Group has a Chief Privacy Officer who oversees privacy governance including policy, dispute resolution, education, communications activities and reporting to our Board of Directors and Executive Management on enterprise-wide privacy matters. See principle #10 for contact information.
When you become a BMO Financial Group customer, or apply for additional products and services, we ask you for your personal information for the following purposes:
to verify your identity and protect against fraud
to understand your financial service requirements
to determine suitability of products and services for you
to determine your eligibility for certain products and services, or those of others, and offer them to you
to set up and manage products and services you have requested, and
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements
Your personal information may be verified with credit bureaus, credit insurers, registries, your employer, personal references and other lenders.
When you apply for a new product or service, we ask you for your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information. You may, at any time, withdraw your consent as long as:
you provide reasonable notice
we are not legally required to collect, use or disclose your information
withdrawing your consent does not impede our ability to fulfill your contract with us
it does not relate to a credit product we have granted you where we are required to collect and exchange your personal information on an ongoing basis with credit bureaus, credit insurers and other lenders
We only collect the information we need. We may ask you to provide the following personal information:
Social Insurance Number (SIN) for tax reporting purposes as well as other government purposes, such as when opening an income generating account or a registered retirement investment. We do this in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency's income reporting requirements. We may also collect and use your SIN for administrative purposes, such as to ensure an accurate match between your personal information and your credit bureau information, or as an internal identification number to accurately identify customers having same or similar names.
Financial Information to ensure that the advice we give is appropriate for you and/or the investments you purchase are suitable for your circumstances.
Health Information is required for some of our insurance products to ensure that you are eligible for coverage.
Contact Information such as your name, address, telephone number or email address.
You can choose not to provide us with certain information in some situations. However, if you make this choice, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information you request. We may monitor or record our incoming or outgoing telephone calls with you for our mutual protection (e.g. to ensure that your instructions are carried out, to document that we have made required disclosures to you, and to ensure that customer service levels are maintained).
We will make certain that you are informed of the purposes listed above when you apply for any of our products or services. If a new purpose for using your personal information develops, we will ask you for your consent.
BMO Financial Group will only use or disclose your personal information for the reason(s) it was collected. Under no circumstances do we sell or give lists of our clients to other companies for their own use and, if we obtain client lists from other organizations, we require the organizations to confirm their compliance with all relevant privacy legislation.
Your personal information may be shared with other companies within BMO Financial Group for the purpose of marketing, including telemarketing, so that these companies can offer you a broader range of product and service solutions to meet your needs.
To ensure that you benefit from our full range of products and services, we will, with your consent, or as required by law or regulation, share your personal information (other than health information) amongst BMO Financial Group. Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, personal information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be transferred as a business asset to the new business owner.
We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account administration and marketing. They will be given only the information needed to perform those services. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same high standards of confidentiality by which we are governed. In some cases, these other companies may be located outside of Canada and may be required to disclose information to government authorities, regulators or law enforcement under a lawful order made in that country.
Personal information may be released to legal or regulatory authorities in cases of suspected money laundering, insider trading, manipulative or deceptive trading, or other criminal activity, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of governments, regulatory authorities or other self-regulatory organizations. Other reasons for the release of personal information include when we are legally required to do so (e.g. by court order) or to protect our assets (e.g. collection of overdue accounts). If we release personal information for any of these reasons, we keep a record of what, when, why and to whom such information was released.
BMO Financial Group has policies in place that govern the retention of your personal information so it will be kept only for as long as it fulfills its intended purpose or as legally required.
We will make certain that you are informed of the purposes listed above when you apply for any of our products or services. If a new purpose for using your personal information develops, we will ask you for your consent.
We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of your personal information and ensuring that it is complete and up-to-date. If you discover inaccuracies in our data, or your personal information changes, please notify the branch or office where you do business immediately, so that we can make the necessary changes. When required, we will make our best efforts to advise others of any important amendments to your personal information that we may have released to them. If we do not agree to make the amendments that you request, you may challenge our decision. Recourse is described in principle #10.
Your personal information is secure within BMO Financial Group, regardless of the format in which it is held. We have comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized use, access, alteration, duplication, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your personal information.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. Examples of safeguards include restricted access to our information processing and storage areas, limited access to relevant information by authorized employees only, use of passwords, PINs and pass keys, firewalls and encryption of electronically transmitted information, and the use of secure locks on filing cabinets and doors.
We have agreements and controls in place with credit bureaus, credit insurers, other lenders and third party service providers requiring that any information provided by us must be safeguarded and used only for the sole purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.
