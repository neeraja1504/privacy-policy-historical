Privacy Policy bmi regional airlines
All personal information held by bmi regional in the UK is governed by the UK Data Protection Act. Any changes to this privacy policy will be updated on this page.
Security
To ensure the highest standards of security, the booking system used by bmi regional, encrypts information using the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL). Consequently, bookings can only be made where customers use Mozilla Firefox 1 and above, Internet Explorer 5.5 and above, or any Web browser which supports SSL.The use of SSL allows all personal information, such as your credit card number, to be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the booking system used by bmi regional. Once received, the information is unencrypted and processed in the same way as a credit card transaction placed via the telephone. At no time is your credit card number stored on our website, or in our online database – it is passed straight back to our secure servers, where it only exists as part of the record of your transaction.
All booking profile information on our website is held on a secure server. Once your PIN number has been entered, all data is encrypted and it is not possible for an unauthorised user to access. Most browsers will notify you when you have established a secure connection. If you are not sure about this, consult the help section of your browser. If your browser does not support SSL, bmi regional recommends that you update to the latest version.

Air Carriers Banned in the EU
Following the preparation by the European Commission of a list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the European Union, all air carriers operating in the European Union are required to bring passengers’ attention to the list on their websites. In compliance with this formality, the current list and further related information can be found on the European Commission website. We would like to reassure our passengers that the publication of this list is simply a formality and that any contract of carriage you enter into with us will not involve a flight with a carrier on the banned list.
