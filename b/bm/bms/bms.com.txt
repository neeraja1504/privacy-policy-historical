We encourage you to read this Internet Privacy Statement before submitting information. By using this Web site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of the Internet Privacy Statement.
Information Voluntarily Provided by Users.  You can visit much of the Web site without telling us who you are or providing us with other personally identifiable information. Some areas of the Web site allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.
Some areas of the Web site may also require that you submit information in order to access specific content, features, interactive tools, services or participate in a particular activity. For example, to create an online account, online user profile or to subscribe to a newsletter, we may ask for your name, contact information, professional credentials and other additional information so we can complete your request.

From time to time we may supplement your personally identifiable information with information we obtain from 3rd party sources  in order to verify such things as your contact information, identity, professional status, specialty, and/or to provide you with more tailored information, communications or products/and or services.
