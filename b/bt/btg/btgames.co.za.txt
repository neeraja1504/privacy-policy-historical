Privacy Statement
BT Games has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our members privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the BT Games website.
All card transactions are processed using PCI DSS certified systems, managed by our payment partners DPO PayGate. DPO PayGate is a PCI DSS level 1 certified payment gateway.
Why have we chosen PayGate? PayGate is well known in South Africa and manage payments for many large, respected retailers who sell online like we do. When PayGate processes a transaction via their secure payment web services, the transaction is encrypted. They make use of the latest SSL encryption which encrypts all data sent from the browser to PayGate in such a way that only their servers can read it. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is the world standard for secure data transmission over the Internet. SSL uses authentication and encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security Inc.
We do not process your payment ourselves, nor do we keep your card details - you will be taken to our payment providers for payment and then returned to the BT Games website afterwards.
In the case of known or suspected abuse of our systems or members, we reserve the right to review and pass any relevant information stored on our systems to the relevant ISP(s) or Police to help prevent the abuse, we will also provide assistance to help identify a member for members who are proceeding with in our view legitimate legal action. We feel the protection of our members is one of our most important goals.
