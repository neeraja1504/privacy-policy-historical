In our registration process, we ask users to provide contact information, for example, your name, email address, geographic location, your company's URL address, and the country or topic group where you would like your banner advertisements to run.

We use customer contact information to provide services and occasionally, provide information on our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. We use unique identifiers, such as login & password, to verify the user's identity and as account numbers in our customer database system.

Unless required to complete a transaction you have requested, or to perform maintenance on our site, we do not share personal identifying information with entities outside Bpath, except those with whom we have specific subcontracting agreements.
