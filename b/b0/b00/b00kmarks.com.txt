Third Party Advertising
The advertisements appearing on the b00kmarks services are delivered to you by ourselves and by advertising agencies. Information about your visit to b00kmarks, such as the number of times you have viewed a particular advertisement (but not information about you, such as your name, address or any other personal information) is used to decide which advertisements to serve to you.
In the course of serving advertisements to you cookie technology may be used, but such cookies will not be used to collect any personally identifiable information about you.

It is our policy to respect the privacy of private communications. We will not intentionally inspect the contents of private communications sent or received using the b00kmarks Portal except as required or permitted to do so by law.
Children and b00kmarks
We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should always get the consent of their parents before giving out any personal information. Where children are specifically encouraged to participate within b00kmarks, they will always be advised that they should seek parental permission before they continue with the activity. We recommend that parents actively participate and where possible monitor their children's use of b00kmarks.
Keeping your details private
The use of Newsgroups or Forums/Chat, either within the b00kmarks Portal or on the Internet, is at your own risk.
