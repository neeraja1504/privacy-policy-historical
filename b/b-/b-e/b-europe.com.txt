3.3. Collection, processing, and uses of personal details at SNCB station counters selling international rail tickets and connected products marketed by SNCB Europe
When buying specific products which are in your name and are non-transferable by virtue of their special conditions (such as certain season tickets or unlimited travel passes), requesting after-sales support involving refunds, or picking up rail tickets previously paid for by a third party, your personal data will be requested and/or collected, including, if and as required, name, date of birth, address, language, financial data if required for a refund, and, if necessary, the relevant details from your identity card or passport (see iii below)
These data will be used
(i) to create the travel document (pass or season ticket) in your name, in compliance with its special conditions of use;
(ii) to complete and amend a purchase file in the event of change or cancellation of a journey previously booked, so that the after-sales support requested can be provided and any refund paid, or
(iii) to hand over international rail tickets and any other products marketed by SNCB Europe which are booked and paid for remotely (by phone, online, or at a travel agency recognised by SNCB Europe), when the person picking up the rail ticket or other product is unable to provide the confidential code given on purchase or the credit card used to pay for the rail ticket or other product, solely for purposes of fraud prevention.
They may therefore be passed on to third parties or subcontractors, as explained below
