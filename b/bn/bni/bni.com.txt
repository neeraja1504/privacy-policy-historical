Privacy Philosophies
Although our business and social network community have unique services and offerings, they share a similar privacy philosophy. BNI follows these privacy principles in our conduct in the collection, use, release and security of Information both online and offline:
Providing you with NOTICE of our information practices.
Giving you with CHOICES about how your data will be used.
Providing you with the opportunity to UPDATE or CORRECT your personal information.
Using information SECURITY safeguards.
Limiting the SHARING of your information.
Committing to COMPLYING with applicable privacy requirements.
Providing you with means to CONTACT US about privacy-related issues.
Information We Collect About You
A. General. In order to better provide you with the products and services offered on the Site, we collect two types of information about our users: personally identifiable information and aggregate information.
Personally identifiable information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on our Site, such as purchasing a product, submitting content and/or posting content on any of our blogs, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. Examples of personally identifiable information may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone numbers, age group, gender and other identifying information. When setting up your profile on our Site, you may be asked to provide an e- mail address, phone number, and address.
Aggregate information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site, and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This technology enables us to determine (i) your IP Address of your computer and its geographic location from installing the applications onto your computer, mobile device or through your GPS of your mobile device; (ii) your search terms or interactive behavior via BNI’s websites; (iii) your purchasing behavior; (iv) source of the information sought by you during your search; and (v) the age of your results data (collectively, “ Shared Information ”). We may use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans.
B. Other Information You Provide. We may also collect and store any personal information you enter on our Site or provide to us in some other manner, including personal information that may be contained in any comment you post to our Site. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number (if provided and applicable); your likeness (both still and moving); and, if you transact business with us or our partner, limited financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).
C. Information About Others. We may also collect and store personal information about other people provided to us by users, potentially including their businesses, contact details including email addresses and/or IP addresses. This data is used in the legitimate interests of providing information to potential members, for the purposes of generating invitations to Chapter meetings and other BNI events, and for the provision of certain other information related to the potential purchase of goods or services from BNI.
D. Sweepstakes and Contests. When BNI offers sweepstakes or contests, personal information is collected with the sole purpose of notifying you if you win the sweepstakes or contest.
E. Automatic Collection of Data. Information concerning your computer hardware and software is automatically collected and may be shared with other BNI or affiliated websites. This information may include: your IP address, browser type and language, domain  names,  access  times,  referring  website  addresses  and  the  content  of  any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see “Cookies” below). BNI uses this information to maintain the quality of its service and to provide general statistics about website visitors.
Cookies. When you visit our Site, we may use one or more “Cookies” to make our Site easier for you to use and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the amount of time you spend on the website. You can remove or block cookies using your settings in most browsers, but if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use some of the features offered on our Site.
Other Technologies. We may use the ever-evolving Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Site. We also may include web beacons in company e-mail messages, newsletters, or notifications to determine whether messages have been opened and/or acted upon. This enables us to customize the services we offer our Site visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.
Information Collected By Third Parties. We may allow third parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Unless expressly stated otherwise, our Site does not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information may allow them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. If you have questions or concerns about this, please email our DPO at dpo@bni.com.
Information From Other Sources. We sometimes supplement the information that we receive that has been outlined in this Privacy Policy with information from other sources and companies. Such outside information includes updated delivery and address information from carriers or third parties, which enables us to correct our records and deliver, for example, future communications more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfilment, advertising, or other services; search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features; search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links from Google); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.
F. Storage and Transfer of Personally Identifiable Information. BNI may store and process in the United States or any other country in which BNI or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain data facilities.
How We Use the Information We Collect
A. General. We will primarily use your personally identifiable information to provide support or service offerings to you. Specifically, BNI collects and uses your personal information in order to:
operate the Site and to deliver the services that you have requested;
manage your account and provide you with customer support;
perform research and analysis about your use of (personal and aggregate), or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others; this information may be used, by way of example only, to help us understand the demographics of potential members, identify chapters with openings for certain professions, inform future marketing campaigns, and judge the success of marketing strategies;
cross market your services/products with our services and our affiliates’ services;
verify your eligibility and deliver online and/or offline in connection with contests and sweepstakes;
enforce our terms and conditions;
manage our business;
enable and leverage applications such as BNI Connect to provide user functionality; and
perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
When you join BNI or visit a BNI-related website, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to provide such information to us. You agree that when you provide your personal identifiable information to us, BNI and its affiliated BNI franchisees may use your information to promote you and BNI. We want your information and preferences to be accurate and complete. You may request access to any personal information and preferences that you have provided to us and correct, modify or update such information and/or preferences by sending an email with your request to dpo@bni.com.
The collection of your e-mail address and name if and when requested during account registration enables BNI and its affiliates to send you any requested newsletter(s) or to send you any requested mailings or offers. If applicable, you will be allowed to indicate upon registration that you are or are not interested in receiving offers or information from our partners and/or us and we may occasionally send you e-mails regarding product and event information or promotions. Only BNI and its affiliates will send you these solicitations, and only if you have previously not indicated that you do not wish to receive them. If applicable and you prefer not to receive such e-mails, please opt out or otherwise do not opt-in to receive these e-mails. If applicable, you may opt-out of receiving e- mails from BNI when you register within your account settings at our Site.
Information concerning your geographical location is used to determine if BNI should provide regionalized information to its site users. When you voluntarily enter a sweepstakes or contest, we request your e-mail address and other contact information in order to be able to contact you in the event you are a winner of the sweepstakes or contest. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the personal information you provide on our Site will not be shared with any third-parties, although BNI reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission.
BNI provides links to send e-mail messages to our Site for your convenience and your e-mail address is used so that our Site may reply to your inquiry. BNI tracks the pages on our Site that our users visit in order to determine which areas of the website are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within our Site to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
The vast majority of data collection from our visitors is used to assess the type of people visiting that website and to determine what content is most frequently accessed by those visitors. This information helps BNI improve its websites by offering content that more specifically meets the interests of our Site visitors.
B. Financial Information. If BNI collects your financial information, it may use your financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases, subscriptions or sales made on our Site, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.
Data Retention
Your data will only be retained for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was obtained. For members of BNI, at a minimum this will be for the duration of your membership and likely longer depending upon applicable laws, rules and regulations. For non-members of BNI, this will be for the duration needed to align with your engagement with us, such as, by way of example only, to enable us to send invitations to Chapter meetings, for maintaining subscriptions to email newsletters, or for the duration of your participation in one of our core groups prior to Chapter launch. Please see our Data Retention Policy, accessible at http://bnitos.com/retention.html for more information.
With Whom We Share Your Information
A. General. We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our Site or while using our services.
B. Personally Identifiable Information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared.
We may share your personal information with:
Authorized Service Providers : We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include processing credit card payments, delivering products and services, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our Sites’ functionality, and supporting other features and promotions offered through our Site. We will only provide these service providers with the limited information that they need to provide us with such services, including limited access to personal information needed to perform their functions. However, they are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on our Site, we will either (a) link you to a third party who handles the transaction outside of our Site, or (b) share transaction information with only those third parties necessary to complete the transaction. We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.
Business partners : From time to time, we may offer promotions, sweepstakes or third-party offerings on our Site. If and when you make purchases, engage in these services and/or products, offered through our Site or our services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant’s offer or program, you consent to us to providing your email address and other information to that merchant. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at legal@bni.com.
Franchisees : We may share your personal information with BNI Master Franchisees or (Sub)franchisees of BNI, who are joint controllers of data (“Data Controller”) with our affiliate BNI Worldwide Development Limited, in order to, by way of example, direct you to a BNI Chapter (whether Franchisee-owned or company-owned) or potentially provide you with additional information about franchise opportunities based on your interest. As joint Data Controllers, Master Franchisees and (Sub)franchisees have separate obligations for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and to demonstrate that their processing activities are compliant with the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR” or the “Regulation”).
Other Situations. We also may also disclose your information:
In response to a subpoena, court order, or other requests for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency (including civil and criminal matters); to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States if we have a good faith belief that response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Service, accessible at https://www.bni.com/terms-and-conditions. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities where applicable.
In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a merger, divestiture, consolidation, or asset sale; though in any event, any acquiring entity or other third-party assignee will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
To protect and defend the rights or property of BNI or one of BNI’s referral networks; and, act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of members and users of BNI, its websites, or the public.
Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies, which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop services that we hope you and other users will enjoy using.
About User-Generated-Content

Protecting Your Personal Information
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized BNI employees, contractors and certain third party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours. There are risks inherent in sharing information, and though we provide some privacy settings for information that you share, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of any person with whom you share your information, and cannot guarantee that only authorized recipients will view your information. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any of our privacy settings or security measures. Please be careful and conscientious with whom you share your videos and choose a strong password that you do not use for other services.
