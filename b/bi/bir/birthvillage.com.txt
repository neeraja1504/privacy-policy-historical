What do we collect about you?
We collect an email address if you wish to use our birth announcement service, or any "Members' Only" features of the site. The email address is used to allow you to login to the account from a different computer. See our use of cookies below for information about logging in.
**Your Friend's Email Address & Name ** (optionally)
If you use our service to send a birth announcement, you need to create a contact list of friends and family members. This information is collected from you in order to send out a customized birth announcement. We DO NOT share this information with any one else, it is solely used when sending a birth announcement that you requested to send.
NOTE : We only collect this information if you actually enter it in our site. Anything you do not supply is impossible for us to access, nor do we want to access it :) Cookies can't tell us anything about you that you have not already told us.
Do you share my information?
We will only share your information with advertisers if you specifically indicated that you don't mind receiving occasional advertisements. We DO NOT automatically check this field, you must explicitly opt in for this.
As well, if you did choose to hear from advertisers you can always remove your self from this list by looking for the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any emails you receive.
How do you use cookies?
We use cookies for login purposes. If you use the same computer and never reset your cookies, you should never have to relogin to our website. However, if you reset your cookies or wish to login on a different computer you will need to use the login link to verify that you are the owner of the account.
We also use cookies to customize your visit to the site. For instance, on our baby names search you can add baby names that you really enjoy to a favorite list. This is accomplished through the use of cookies.
How can I contact BirthVillage.com?
We don't like SPAM either. And since we don't want to get tons of automated spam, we do not disclose an EMAIL ADDRESS on our site. Instead, please contact us through our contact form page. It will still send an email and a real person will get back to you.
