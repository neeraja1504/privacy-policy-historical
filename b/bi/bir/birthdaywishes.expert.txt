2. Our Commitment to Privacy

As a user of our website, you may request that we export and send you all the data we keep about you or that we delete all your data on our server. (see 11)
Certain information we collect is non-personal (see 4) and may not by itself lead to an identifiable person, but could become personal information when combined with other information. Examples of that non-personal information include your IP address and your GPS location.
We have no access to the missing information that would lead to an identifiable person. However, we might be legally obliged to disclose non-personal information to government authorities or confidentially to legal counsels of our website, in cases like the enforcement of the law by electronic crime services or through court orders, the exercise of our legal rights, the protection of our website from an attack or the protection of our users, partners or collaborators as regards to any legal action.
