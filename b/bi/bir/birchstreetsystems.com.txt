E.U. – U.S. Safe Harbor Privacy Statement.   For personal information of employees, consumers, healthcare professionals, medical research subjects and investigators, customers, investors, and government officials that BirchStreet receives from the European Economic Area, BirchStreet has committed to handling such personal information with the Safe Harbor Principles. BirchStreet’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx.  For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce website at http://export.gov/safeharbor/.
BirchStreet Website and Services Privacy Statement.  BirchStreet respects the privacy of visitors to the BirchStreet website and users of the BirchStreet System.  This Website and Services Privacy Statement applies only to the operations of websites that directly link to this Policy when you click on “privacy policy” on a BirchStreet operated website or product.
Information Collected by BirchStreet.   BirchStreet collects certain information from our customers using BirchStreet services and prospective customers who may utilize the BirchStreet website.  The information that we gather assists BirchStreet in personalizing BirchStreet products, contacting customers and prospective customers, and improving the BirchStreet experience and relationship with our users.  BirchStreet may collect information that is considered personally identifiable in certain jurisdictions.  BirchStreet may collect information that you disclose in requesting a demonstration of services or similar contact request through the BirchStreet website, as well as the information collected to use the BirchStreet Application.  BirchStreet may also receive information about you from other sources including trade organizations and contact directories provided to BirchStreet.  This includes, but is not limited to your name, contact information such as telephone and facsimile, email address, employer and their contact information, and job title.
Data Integrity.   BirchStreet will only collect information from you that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used, and will not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with such purposes for which it has been collected or authorized to be used by you.
Notice. When we collect your personal information, we’ll give you timely and appropriate notice describing what personal information we’re collecting, how we’ll use it, and the types of third parties with whom we may share it.  BirchStreet shall inform an individual for the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Information and the types of non-agent third parties to which BirchStreet discloses or may disclose that Information.  BirchStreet shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclose of their personal information.  Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to BirchStreet, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before BirchStreet uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected.
Choice.   We’ll give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we’ll respect the choices you make.  BirchStreet will allow individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information is (1) disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  A visitor to the BirchStreet website or a user of the BirchStreet System may choose to not provide certain information; however this may limit or restrict the user or visitor’s ability to use the BirchStreet System and ability to take advantage of many BirchStreet features.

Accuracy. BirchStreet will take appropriate steps to make sure the personal information in our records is accurate.  BirchStreet shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
Access.   BirchStreet will provide you with access to your personal information and account (where permitted) for the limited purposes of viewing, editing inaccuracies, and updating the information.
