How Do We Safeguard Personal Data of EU Citizens With Certain Rights Under GDPR
When personal data being handled involves an individual who is a citizen of any country within the EU specifically, we take certain steps to ensure your personal data is protected under GDPR. These steps include, but are not limited to:
We ensure that your personal data does not get sent to third-party vendors who do not have specific business reasons to possess it. (i.e. We will send your data to companies that help us analyze your data on our behalf for our own business purposes. We will also send your data to third-party companies when we are obligated to do so due to contractual reasons.)
When we no longer require your data to fulfill any service for which it was initially retained, we will dispose of the data in line with Biblica’s data retention procedures. As a general rule, personal data is not manually saved for periods longer than necessary, but may exist on certain systems and platforms of ours indefinitely in backups and other forms of automated retention as needed, particularly when there are legal reasons for retention such as for income tax and audit purposes.
How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.
Specific Third-Party Companies and Organizations With Whom We May Share Information
As generally stated above, we may share your information with many different third-parties. While this is not an exhaustive list, in general, here are some of the third-party companies, organizations, and platforms with which we work.
