Cookies:
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on Biblio.com. We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's help file.
Cookies are used on our site to keep track of items you have placed in your shopping cart for purchase, to retain your session login so that you do not have to re-enter your password to perform actions such as adding items to your cart and completing the checkout steps. Cookies are also used to help our site remember certain preferences, such as your ship to country and preferred shipping speed, product interest, and to associate qualifying purchases with Biblio's affiliate partners, in order to ensure that they are paid accurately for the referral services they perform. We also use cookies to analyze our website traffic.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site but you will not be able to place orders. In order to purchase online using our secure checkout, cookies must be enabled. This is so that our system can associate your purchase with your account and shopping cart. You have the option to remove this information at the completion of your purchase, or to request that our system remember your information for future purchases.
Some of our business partners (e.g., web analytics providers and affiliate management providers) use cookies on our site. These cookies may be used to gather general demographic information about website visitors and information about products viewed by website visitors. We use this general demographic and product interest information for marketing purposes. Specifically we may use this information in conjunction with third party advertising vendors including Google to serve ads on various sites across the internet. You can choose to opt-out of having this information used for advertising purposes using the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Email to a friend:
If you choose to use our 'email to a friend' service to tell a friend about a book you found on Biblio.com, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will use this information to send your friend a one-time email with a link to the item on Biblio.com, the comment you made, and your email address. Biblio uses this information to send this one-time email and to track the success of our 'email to a friend' program. Biblio does not share this information with any other party.
Ask the seller a question:
If you choose to use our 'ask the seller a question' service, we will ask for your email address, name, and your inquiry. This information will be shared with the seller so that the seller can respond to your inquiry. Biblio does not share this information with any other party.
Want list:
If you choose to use our 'want list' service, we will ask you for search terms that describe the item(s) you are seeking. We will use the search terms provided and the email address in your Biblio.com account to find matching items and periodically send you emails with links to matching items. You are required to create an account to use the 'want list service'. You may edit your want list at any time or opt out of the service by deleting your want list(s).
Mailing list:
When using Biblio.com you have the option to subscribe to our mailing list. If you subscribe to an email list, we will use your email address to send you periodic email messages from that list. You do not have to subscribe to an email list to create an account or to place orders. We will share your email address with our email provider for the sole purpose of delivering emails to you. We will not share your email address with any other party, and we will not send you email that is unrelated to the email list you joined. You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of the promotional email messages we send or by contacting us directly. If you create an account you can also manage your email subscriptions from your account menu.
Create account:
When creating an account on Biblio.com we will ask for your email address, country of residence, and a password. We will use the email address and password provided to verify your identity when you log in to the website. We will use the country provided to show default shipping rates. You must provide this information to create an account. We use your account to display your order history, current want list, and any books you have added to a wishlist. You do not have to create an account to place orders, but an account is required to create a want list or add items to a wishlist.
Orders:
When you place an order on Biblio.com, we request contact and payment information to complete this order. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, shipping and billing address) and, depending on the payment method you choose, you may be asked to provide payment information (such as credit card number, cvv and expiration date). Optionally, you may choose to save your payment information for use in subsequent orders. If you so choose we will securely encrypt and store your payment information as part of your account. Saved payment information will only be used at your request for processing subsequent orders.
We use this information to process your payment and to communicate with you about the order. We will share your contact information with the bookseller(s) whose books you are ordering so that they can ship your order. We do not share your payment information with the bookseller(s). Our booksellers are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than fulfilling your order.
Your payment information will be shared with our payment processor so that your payment can be processed. Elements of your order information not including your credit card number will be shared with our payment risk assessment provider for the sole purpose of assessing payment risk.
For United States customer orders we use a third-party customer review site to provide a forum for our customers to leave reviews of our service that are collected and verified by this third-party company. To facilitate these reviews we share your email address, name and order number. We share this information solely for the purpose of facilitating these reviews.
Law Enforcement Requests:
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. In addition we reserve the right to comply with law enforcement requests for information that we deem reasonable. Unless prohibited by law we will notify you via email when we share your information as a result of these requests or legal processes.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
