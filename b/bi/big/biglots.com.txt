Important Information
Public Disclosure. The Service may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “User Content”), such as on, and in association with your account(s). We may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service. We are not responsible for User Content you submit to third party services, including third party social media websites, via our Service.
Information from Children. Our Service is not geared towards children and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent. If we learn that we have received information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete this information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Please contact us if you believe your child may have provided us with information without COPPA-required consent and you would like us to work to delete the information.
Third Party Services. The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties (" Third Party Services(s) "). These Third Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to independently collect information about you. In addition, these Third Party Services may solicit information from you. Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third Party Services, such as third party social networks (“ Social Features ”).  Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” Big Lots’ content; logging in to the Service using your Third Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service).  If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the Third Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Big Lots in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Big Lots.  Also, both Big Lots and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third Party Service. We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of such Third Party Services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your information.
Advertising & Analytics Services and Online Tracking. We and our service providers may engage third parties, such as Google Analytics, to serve advertisements on our behalf on the Service and/or on Third Party Services and to provide analytics services about the use of the Service and the performance of our ads and content on Third Party Services. You may exercise choices regarding Google Analytics, and learn about, access and use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to Service visitors, on and off of the Service, based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain Third Party Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as your IP address, device identifier, Ad ID, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and Third Party Services and better understand your online activity.
This means that some information about your browsing of the Service and certain Third Party Services may be collected (including across time and services) and shared with third parties for the purpose of delivering ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services, and Big Lots may receive from some of these parties information about Third Party Services that you have visited. This information may be used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed “targeting,” "retargeting," “interest-based advertising,” and “online behavioral advertising.”
The statements of our practices in this Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies). Consult their privacy policies and notice for information regarding their practices.
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at http://www.youradchoices.com/. In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt-out of certain targeted advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, visit here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members no longer will be allowed under the DAA / NAI rules to deliver certain targeted ads to you, which will affect this and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, or use a non-browser-based method of access, your NAI / DAA opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs. However, we support the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based ads will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance.
Social Features. To allow you interact with third party social media websites, we may provide links or embed third party applications that allow you to login, post content or share information from the Service. Your use of these links and applications is subject to the third parties’ privacy policies, and you should become familiar with the third party social media websites’ privacy policies before using the links or applications. Big Lots is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those third party social media websites.
Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication or refer a job to a friend. By sending a communication or referring a job to a friend, you represent that you and your friend are United States citizens and that you have permission to provide your friend’s first and last name and e-mail address. The friend’s information you provide will be used to send the communication or job posting and not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. Your contact information and message may be included in the communication or referral. Volunteer Opportunities and Donation Requests. We may provide you the ability to track your volunteer work and submit your volunteer hours. In addition, the Service may offer you the option to request a donation on behalf of an organization. By requesting a donation on behalf of an organization, you represent that the organization is a 501(c)3 non-profit authorized to conduct business under the laws of the United States and that you have permission to request a donation on its behalf. The organization’s information you provide will be used to contact the organization and your contact information may be included in the communication.

If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list.

Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with such information, we may submit that information to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies or otherwise use or disclose it for business-related purposes, including responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints.
Changes to this Privacy Policy. Big Lots may revise this Privacy Policy in the future. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy on the Service. We will not use your information in a manner materially different than what was stated in the policy in effect at the time the information was collected unless we receive your consent.
Disputes; Governing Law; Jurisdiction
Disputes.  ** Except as specifically stated herein, you agree that any disputes, actions, and claims relating to your use of the Service and all matters arising out of or related to this Privacy Policy, the Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms, as that term is defined in the Agreement (collectively “Disputes” or a “Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Columbus, Ohio, if your claims qualify.  The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. All of the AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org, and the rules governing consumer disputes are available at www.adr.org/consumer. The AAA’s rules, including the rules governing consumer disputes, are also available by calling 1-800-778-7879.  You may initiate arbitration by utilizing the forms available on www.adr.org. If you have any difficulty initiating arbitration, you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. You and Big Lots are each giving up the right to have disputes resolved in court before a judge and/or jury (except as stated otherwise in this Section entitled “Disputes; Governing Law; Jurisdiction” (this “Disputes Section”)).  The provisions of this Disputes Section constitute your and Big Lots’ written agreement for resolving Disputes, including the agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“ Dispute Agreement** ”). The most current version of this Dispute Agreement in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (“ Arbitration Fees ”) will be governed by the AAA's rules.  You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Columbus, Ohio.  We will reimburse to you Arbitration Fees you paid for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary.  The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Agreement.
Governing Law.  You agree that all Disputes will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), applicable Federal Law, and laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
No Class Action Matters. You and Big Lots each agree that resolution of any Disputes, whether in court or in arbitration, will be conducted and resolved only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, and that any relief awarded, including equitable relief, shall only be awarded on an individual basis.
Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you or Big Lots may bring suit in court to seek an injunction, a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief arising out of, or relating to, enforcement of Section I and Section II of the Agreement, or claims related to the validity or enforcement of your or our intellectual property rights.
No Jury Trial; Choice of Law and Forum for Court Proceedings.  If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court, other than for Disputes brought in a small claims court for qualifying claims, you and Big Lots agree:  (i) that any such Dispute may only be brought in a state or federal court in Columbus, Ohio, to be governed by the FAA, applicable Federal Law, and the laws of Ohio, without regard to conflict of law principles; (ii) to further irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts in Columbus, Ohio; and, (iii) **to waive any right to a trial by jury.   **
Severability.  With the exception of the subsection entitled “No Class Action Matters”, if any part of this Disputes Section is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then the remaining provisions of this Disputes Section shall remain in force as if any portion ruled unenforceable were not included in this Disputes Section.  If this Disputes Section is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then the subsection entitled “Disputes” shall no longer be enforceable, but the remainder of this Disputes Section shall remain in effect.
