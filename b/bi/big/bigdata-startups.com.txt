How did we obtain your personal data?
Datafloq has obtained your data because you have provided this data to us.
What are your rights?
Under the European General Data Protection Regulation you have a number of rights with regard to your data and the processing thereof:
Access
You may access your personal information and make any necessary changes in your account. If you would like to see which personal data Datafloq has obtained about you, you may exercise your right of access by submitting a request to Datafloq. In addition, if you have an account on Datafloq, you can also delete any data that we have collected from you. You can also request an archive of all the data that we have collected.
Making changes
If you wish to make changes to the personal information that you have seen as a result of a request for access and you are unable to make the changes yourself in your account, you may request that Datafloq makes these changes for you. You may request that Datafloq modifies, corrects, supplements, erases or shields your information.
Restriction of processing of personal data
You also have the right, under certain conditions, to ask Datafloq to restrict the processing of your personal data.
Right to object
If processing of your data takes place on the grounds of 'legitimate interest' by Datafloq or a third party, you have the right to object to that processing.
Portability of data
You have the right to obtain your personal data from Datafloq. Datafloq will provide this in a structured and commonly used format, which can easily be opened using commonly used digital systems.
Automated processing
Whenever a decision about you is taken that is completely based on automated processing of your personal data, you have the right to request that that decision be re-evaluated by a person. You may at all times let us know your position on that decision or let us know that you do not agree with our decision.
Withdrawing Consent
When the legal basis for a particular processing is your explicit consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent. This does not affect past processing, but does mean that we will no longer be allowed to process this data in the future. It may also result in Datafloq no longer being able to provide you with certain services.
Response from Datafloq
A request can be sent to info@datafloq.com. Datafloq will comply with your request as soon as possible and in any case no later than one (1) month after Datafloq has received such a request. If Datafloq rejects your request, we will indicate in our reply why the request was rejected.
Recipients of your personal data
Your data may be transmitted to:
Data processors
Parties that are involved in the execution or fulfilment of an agreement between you and Datafloq
It is possible that Datafloq is required to submit your data to a third party, for example, to fulfil a legal obligation.
Transfer to third countries or international organisations
It may be necessary, for instance for technical and operational reasons, to transfer your (personal) data to affiliates of Datafloq located outside the European Economic Area. Due to the possibility that the regulations in the area of privacy protection do not offer the same protection as within the European Economic Area, Datafloq will use the Privacy Shield or the EU Model Clauses to protect your privacy as much as possible. If that is not possible, Datafloq will ask your consent to transfer your (personal) data to countries that do not maintain an adequate protection level. You may withdraw your consent at any time.
Automated Decision Making
Datafloq can use automated decision-making processes based on your data when it is necessary for the execution of an agreement between you and Datafloq. It is possible that, based on your profile, you will be shown an adjusted price for Datafloq’s products or services. Datafloq.
