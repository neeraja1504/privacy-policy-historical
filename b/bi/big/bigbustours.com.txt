DIRECT MARKETING: YOUR CONSENT MATTERS
What have I consented to do?
We will not send direct marketing messages to you unless you have opted-in to our marketing. If you have opted-in, this means that we may contact you via your chosen media (such as SMS, email or mail):

- to deliver relevant, tailored advertising to you with information about products or services we feel may interest you.
Can I withdraw my consent?
You are always free to opt-in to our marketing and you are always free to opt-out at any time; this will never have an impact on our commitment to provide you with great service and a quality product.

For all contacts already opted-in to our communications, we will assume you want us to keep in touch until the point you have voluntarily opted out.
Updating your consent
Our database will automatically remove you from our communications once unsubscribed.
