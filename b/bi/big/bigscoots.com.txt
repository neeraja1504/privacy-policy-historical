At any time feel free to review your browsers help file to gather the instructions necessary to remove these persistent cookies, however please keep in mind they are only being used in the first place to stream line our interaction with you and better our service.
4. Log Files

This is a form of data gathering which may include information such as internet protocol addresses, internet service providers, browser type and versions, referring and exit pages, platforms, date and time stamps, number of clicks for trend analysing as well as gathering very broad demographic information.

6. Disclosure of Data
Although unlikely and not in the foreseeable future, BigScoots does reserve the right to disclose completely anonymous data to investors and/or possible partners. In this case purely basic information will be disclosed and individually distinguishable data will remain completely private. In the case of BigScoots being sold, the information collected from our clients may be transferred to the new owner(s) under the condition that all individually distinguishable data will remain private.
BigScoots may on occasion interact with a third party consultant, advisor, marketing team or IT professional where it may become necessary to disclose private data.

All third parties are prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party.
Further, individuals will always have access to their own personal data unless those same individuals have previously requested their data to be removed.

BigScoots shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless BigScoots proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

These disclosures will only occur if BigScoots has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary or BigScoots is required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served to BigScoots.
On occasion our clients may also find links to other websites through the BigScoots site or through other correspondence.
