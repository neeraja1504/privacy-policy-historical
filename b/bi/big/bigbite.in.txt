1. What Types of Information Do We Collect From You?
Personally Identifiable Information (or " PII ") is information that identifies you as an individual. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to use for the services offered on the Site), we may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number (including the three (3) or four (4) digit validation code for your credit card), when you voluntarily provide it to us or when your employer provides any such PII to us.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or " Non-PII ") is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser and demographic data, for example your location, gender and date of birth and we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Additionally, we and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII such as your employer's department code and expense code when provided to us by your or your employer.
