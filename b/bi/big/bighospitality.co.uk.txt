7. Cookies
When you view our Websites we may store information on the hard drive of your computer or on your mobile device in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file). Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, William Reed) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, videos and website analytics services). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognise your computer when you later re-open your browser and browse the internet again.
We use cookies for several reasons. For example, cookies enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
The specific types of cookies served through the Websites, either by William Reed or third parties and the purposes they perform are described in the table below:
