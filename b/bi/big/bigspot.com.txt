Privacy Policy | BigSpot.com
BigSpot.com ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of our online survey panels (the "Service") currently operated from BigSpot.com (the "Website"). We created this Privacy Policy to give you confidence and describe how we treat personal information as you visit and use our Service and Website. Click to Contact Us. Collection of Personal Information We collect information from users including email address, username, password, survey response information, log file information (such as IP address and browser data), and cookies. Registration Information. You need a username and password from us to access the protected areas of the Website. We require some limited personal information to create an account for you, including your user name, password, email address, mailing address and telephone number (optional). We also collect and maintain Social Security Numbers of members as required only for tax reporting purposes for any member whose points and rewards exceed $600 per year. When you use the protected areas of the Website, certain information about your use is automatically recorded and retained, such as account activity (e.g., number of log-ins), data displayed or clicked on (e.g., user interface elements, links), and other log information described below. Survey responses and other submissions. We may provide you opportunities to participate in surveys on our Website. If you participate, or apply to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes background/demographic information, which might include, for example, as zip code, age, consumer habits or information about hobbies, interests, employment status and product ownership ("background/demographic information"). The requested information also includes members' survey responses to questions and issues of interest to us and our clients ("response information"). We also collect information volunteered by users of our Website, such as by completing and submitting our online forms, or emailing or mailing us. Log file information. When users visit our Website, our servers automatically collect certain information that the browser sends when visiting websites in general. This log file information may include the URLs you visited; your IP address; date, time, and time spent on pages visited; and information about your browser and platform. Cookies. From time to time, our Service and/or Website may use the "cookies" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your use of the same. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies. Cookies help us learn which portions of our Service and Website are useful and which need improvement, recognize your account when you visit our Website, and collect and analyze statistical information (e.g., date and time of visits to our Website), among other things. [You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your survey responses will not be tracked and you will not receive related points or rewards, and your experience with the Service otherwise may be significantly diminished. We may offer you the opportunity to participate in surveys for which a client requires additional cookies for those particular surveys. Those additional cookies would be used only with your approval. Use of Personal Information Generally. We use the personally identifiable information and aggregate/anonymous information we collect to maintain your account and market and provide the Service and Website to you, to email invitations or text/SMS alerts to you to participate in surveys, to determine your eligibility for and match you to particular surveys, to deliver points and rewards to you, to provide background/demographic information and response information to our clients in aggregate/anonymous form only, to improve our offerings and to create new offerings. "Aggregate/anonymous " means to combine the member's information with the information of other members without identifying a specific member or to make data anonymous so that it describes the interest profile, demographics data and/or response of a particular member without specifically identifying the member. In particular, we do not send "spam." The emails that we send after your registration will be to invite or alert you to participate in our surveys, to deliver points and rewards to you, or to send newsletters, updates, and other service or administrative notices. You may opt out at any time as described below under "Opting Out." Registration Information. We do not use your personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages to you (such as offers regarding the Service) without your consent or opt-in. We may send you certain service and administrative notices, which are not subject to opt out. Background/demographic information and response information. We always report background/demographic information, as well as response information, in aggregate/anonymous form to our clients. We also use this information to target our surveys and better interpret our survey findings. Log file information and cookies. We use cookies and log file information to remember your information so that you do not need to re-enter it when using the Service and Website, to provide personalized content; and to administer and monitor usage of the Service and Website.
