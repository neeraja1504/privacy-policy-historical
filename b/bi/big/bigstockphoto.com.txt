Bigstock and partners of Bigstock may use cookies and action tags to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information.
A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer when you visit a site. Bigstock may use session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want us to deploy cookies to your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site.
An action tag is similar to a cookie. Action tags help us identify and track the performance of web pages on the Site, allowing us to measure the performance and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition, Bigstock may use action tags in emails. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing, for example, how many emails have been opened.
Electronic tracking technologies are used to enhance your experience on the Site, including allowing you to remain logged in on the Site. Cookies and pixel tags may also be used to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information that does not identify you personally. However, Bigstock and partners of Bigstock may use cookies to store some of your preferences (including limited Personal Information) or to display relevant content based upon what you view on the Site.

Bigstock recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible and respectful use of the personal information collected on the Site. You may "opt out" of receiving Bigstock's promotional email updates, newsletters and/or partner emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link available near the bottom of any Bigstock marketing email.
Bigstock reserves the right to contact you when there are changes to the Terms Service, or for other service related announcements as applicable.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account.
Protection of your personal information
The security of your personal information is important to us and Bigstock protects it several ways.
Access to the personal information on your User Account requires a password. You should use a password that is at least 8 characters long, and comprised of a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. Do not divulge your password to anyone.
Your personal information resides on a password-protected, secure server. Only select Bigstock personnel and contractors who require access to do their job are given the password to the server.
Bigstock encrypts your personal information during transmission to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to and from Bigstock.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on registration or order forms, Bigstock encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Bigstock strives to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Bigstock receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While Bigstock uses commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Bigstock cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can send email to us on Bigstock's Contact Us page.
