HOW DOES  BIGFIX GATHER PERSONAL INFORMATION?
General Browsing:  BigFix gathers navigational information about where you go on our Web site. This information allows us to see which areas of our website are most visited. This helps us improve the quality of visitor's online experience by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. Additional non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding your use of our Web site (such as the time of your last visit to a page on our site).
Registration and Transactions:  Any information you provide to us at this site when you establish or update an account or request information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address and telephone number), is maintained in private files on our secure Web server and our internal systems. This information is used to enable BigFix to deliver services to you. BigFix and its employees do not entertain the credit card information in any form of communication on any of the media (website, chat, testimonial, email and voice). BigFix neither stores nor publishes your credit card number on any of the media form on its server.
System information:  BigFix do not access any personal information (such as the contents of personal documents or web browsing history) stored on a PC. The data collected from the PC includes items such as:
System board, BIOS, CPU, video, and memory configuration;
Disk drives, disk controllers, and installed hardware;
System name & IP, Windows version, and browser type;
System status such as CPU load and available disk space;
Programs running during testing.
Use of Cookies:  BigFix uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies also allow BigFix to make our site more responsive to your needs, by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by BigFix to help track your clicks as you go through the pages within BigFix web site. In addition, BigFix uses cookies to help keep track of support requests and to tell us whether you have previously visited BigFix. This allows registered users to avoid re-entering information upon every new visit to our site.
DOES  BIGFIX DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Web site, the site or the public. BigFix does not sell, rent or trade your e-mail address to third parties. We may, however, use third parties to help us provide services to you, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, and administering e-mails. If personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number) is provided to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in strictest confidence.
WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROTECTING MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Member account, password and security:  If any of the Services requires you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration form. You also will choose a password and a user name. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify BigFix immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. BigFix will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by BigFix or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the permission of the account holder.
We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your personal information including billing and shipping information by logging into your account.
When you create or change your account, we will send a message to the email address confirming the changes made and options you have chosen. BigFix periodically distributes an e-mail newsletter, and you choose whether you want to receive a newsletter from us when you create your account. If you later decide not to receive the newsletter, you can remove yourself from the mailing list at any time.
Forgotten, Lost or Stolen Information:  If you have forgotten your password, we provide a mechanism that e-mails your password to you. Since the "forgot my password" feature sends your password to the email address that you used for registration, do not use an email address that can be accessed by others that you would not want to see or change your BigFix account information.
Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself or your children in any Communication Services. BigFix does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Services and, therefore, BigFix specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Services. Managers and hosts are not authorized BigFix spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of BigFix.

Access:  BigFix provides individuals with access to the Personal Information about them that BigFix holds. BigFix agrees that individuals may correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
Security:  BigFix takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. BigFix's website has safeguards in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the data you provide to us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. While BigFix strives to protect your Personal Information, BigFix cannot guarantee the security of the Personal Information, so BigFix urges you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. Within BigFix, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access by authorized personnel...
