Privacy
BigMachines, Inc. has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. Privacy on the bigmachines.com Web Site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Collected Information: In order to access certain portions of the Site, you will be required to register by providing certain limited information regarding you and the company you represent. BigMachines, Inc. may use the information that we collect to contact visitors to further discuss their interest in our company and the services and products we provide and to send information regarding our company, service and product offerings, such as newsletters and events. Visitor email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties in any circumstance. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by visiting http://www.bigmachines.com/emailoptout.php , or sending an email to marketing@bigmachines.com.
Cookies: When you interact with our Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. Our Web server may send a cookie to the computer of our Site visitors. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to BigMachines, Inc., either by requesting a download or registering for a demo or webinar, you remain anonymous to BigMachines, Inc. If you choose not to accept cookies from the domain "bigmachines.com", you will still be able to access the entire Site, however you will be required to re-register each time you would like to access those portions of the Site which require registration.
When we send messages to you or others, we may provide a link that contains an identifier, which allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message, record whether the email has been open and set a cookie so we can link non-personal data to their email address. We do this in order to tailor our communication for that individual.
Log Files: We use visitor's IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. BigMachines occasionally matches these IP addresses to publicly-available company IP registries, and BigMachines may contact visiting companies to discuss potential interest in our company. IP addresses that we collect are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Users Outside of the United States: While we make every effort to honor the laws and wishes of all users, this Site is available for users located primarily in the United States of America and therefore may not recognize foreign laws.
