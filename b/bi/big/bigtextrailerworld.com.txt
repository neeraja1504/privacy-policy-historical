about the personal information this web site collects and how it is used
This Web site routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such as:
visitor, subscriber, member, or customer information obtained from 'registration'
Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member, or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this Web site. This can include pages or pop-ups where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the Web site via email, mail, or courier; joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; ordering a product.
Occasionally, complete credit card information may be provided to the Web site via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing. This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.
online ordering
Online ordering via SSL-encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Mastercard provides information to the Web site but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password. You should consider all this information available to the Web site. This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.

Website visitors who wish to communicate with the Web site do so under two conditions: they give their permission for contact by the Web site; and they are subject to any 'submission' provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement or this Privacy Policy.
