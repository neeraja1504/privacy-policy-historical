Optional Information. At various other points during your visit to Votigo, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.
Passive Collection of Information. In addition to the information which you actively provide to Votigo by methods such as completing the registration form, Votigo collects information about how you interact with our site. Votigo collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site.

Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

In addition, as described above, Votigo utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our site. This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.

From time to time, Votigo may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending communications to Votigo's users.

The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are governed by a more specific provision below.
While Votigo strives to protect the personal information of our users, Votigo will release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate.

Votigo helps protect personally identifiable information by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. Our staff is trained to comply with our security procedures, and our security procedures are regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the Privacy team at Votigo.
