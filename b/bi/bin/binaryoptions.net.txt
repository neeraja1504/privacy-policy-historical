Privacy Policy
BinaryOptions.net respects our users’ right to privacy. We do not collect any personal data from you unless it is strictly necessary (e.g. for broker complaints).
By using our website and reading out articles, you abide to the privacy policy here on this page.
Users Privacy
We do not collecting personal information from any of our users, except in cases where this is strictly necessary.  We do not pass on or sell your personal information to any third parties or operators.  If you would like to contact us or provide a complaint, can do so through our contact page here.
Cookie Tracking Software
Our website uses a number of different types of cookies which are necessary for the functioning and monetizing of our website.
Many of our links to third party websites use affiliate tracking links. This means that when you click on some of our links to binary options brokers, a harmless cookie will be installed on your computer for a period of 30-60 days.  These tracking cookies are necessary for the financial compensation of our website and tracking users to different websites.  The cookies themselves are not served by our website and we do not collect any personal information from them.
In addition to third party tracking cookies, our website also uses Analytics cookies to analyze website behavior and traffic on our site.  This is strictly necessary for monitoring our traffic (which we need proof of in order to negotiate media deals and sell banners), finding our most popular articles and seeing where our traffic is coming form.
Affiliate Earnings Disclaimer
BinaryOptions.net may receive revenue through affiliate marketing deals with binary options brokers.  Website users may therefore be tracked to third party websites through harmless tracking cookies.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
