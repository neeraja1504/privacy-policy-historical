The Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect, how we may use that personal information and with whom we may share it, as well as the measures we take to help protect the security of the personal information. We also tell you how you can contact us to update or remove your personal information or receive answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices. Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by the Institute, and not to websites maintained by other organizations to which we may link.

In addition, prize winners may be required to provide their Social Security or other identification number for tax purposes.

The Institute does not wish to receive any personally identifiable information pertaining to any individual unless all requisite permissions have been obtained in advance, including parental consent.  You hereby represent and warrant to the Institute that you have full authority to submit the personally identifiable information and other information required for any interaction with the site.
How the Institute Uses Your Information
The Institute uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, special offers, contests, other related programs, and events of interest. You, or in the case of children aged 17 and below, your parents, may also later opt out of any or all of these communications.
The Institute may also use personal information to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, to ensure proper functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor our offerings, and web experience to you.  Your information may be shared with or transferred to our affiliates and any other organization or entity for similar purposes.
Furthermore, we may share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs and Profiles
You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to Institute sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.
You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information (or any other information) you choose to make public in any of these forums.
Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. The Institute has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.
How We Protect Personal Information
We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and/or physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information you provide.
You should be aware that “perfect security” does not exist on the internet or on mobile communications equipment.  As a consequence, there is always a risk that unauthorized persons may use or access your personally identifiable information.  You use our website and other technologies to send us information at your own risk.  If you are worried because your communication is sensitive, do not send it electronically.
Special Note on Donors
The Institute is committed to protecting the privacy of our donors. We honor your privacy and respect your choice not to have your personal information shared with other organizations. Occasionally the Institute exchanges names with other like-minded non-profit organizations for purposes of its direct mail campaign. The direct mail exchange process is an essential element of our program, enabling us to reach more supporters while keeping expenses as low as possible. Any other use of these names is prohibited. These names cannot be rented, sold, or exchanged and data on these files cannot be used to enhance other data files without written permission from the Institute.
From time to time, we will invite our donors to observe our programs and they may wish to send a supporting message to the students. We do not allow direct communications contact between donors and students except with the express approval from the students’ parents. The Institute staff will serve as the main point of contact for sending such communications.
Special Note on Students
We are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the internet and who participate in our programs.  Our website is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. No information should be submitted nor posted to Institute online sites by students 13 years of age or under without express parental consent. In certain jurisdictions, notification, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required of a parent or guardian for children from 13 to 17 years of age. If you believe your child has provided us with information without your consent, please email us at address set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
From time to time, we will have donors observe our programs and they may wish to send a supporting message to the students. We do not allow direct communications contact between donors and students except with the express approval from the students’ parents. The Institute staff will serve as the main point of contact for such communications.
Since an email address is necessary to respond to lost password requests and account administration, in some circumstances we may ask for a student’s email address. Newsletter subscriptions are handled similarly.
Our Constitutional Quiz website permits students to create an account, upload a picture file to personalize an account, select their state, and identify their grade level. The student may also use the social media feature to share our website with others. This information gathered is not shared with anyone outside of the Institute. We will use the aggregate information to assess civic understanding in the US by state and by grade level.
Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.
Parents have the right to consent prior to the collection of their children’s information.  All information collected will be treated by the Institute in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions. Parents also have the right to restrict access to their children’s information.  Parents should be aware that exercising such right will restrict their children’s use of the Site. If for any reason you are concerned that your student’s personally identifiable information maintained by the Institute is not correct or complete, should you wish to have your child’s personal information deleted from our records, or if you want the Institute to discontinue further collection or use of your student’s personal information, please contact the Institute at info@billofrightsinstitute.org.
Job Search Data
You may be able to submit your resume and other information for a job with the Institute.
