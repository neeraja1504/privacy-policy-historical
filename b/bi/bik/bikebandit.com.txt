Why is Shopping at BikeBandit.com Secure?
When you shop at BikeBandit.com, you'll be one of thousands of our customers who safely shop with us every month. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure online commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
The BikeBandit.com Secure Shopping Guarantee protects you while you shop at BikeBandit.com so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at BikeBandit.com will be safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card at BikeBandit.com. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, BikeBandit.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. BikeBandit.com will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at BikeBandit.com while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
While BikeBandit.com uses encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, BikeBandit.com also protects your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which BikeBandit.com stores personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
