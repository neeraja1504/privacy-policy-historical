1. BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA CONTROLLER
1.1 Data controller/processor
This Privacy Policy regulates the data processing by GRAPHISOFT, and it is therefore GRAPHISOFT who generally qualifies as data controller in respect of your personal data. There are however certain cases where GRAPHISOFT does not act as a data controller but instead acts as a subordinate of another data controller, which case GRAPHISOFT is understood to be a data processor (acting on behalf of another controller while processing the personal data – in such case GRAPHISOFT proceeds in accordance and based on the instructions of the data controller and processes data only to the extent as prescribed by the data controller).
Please also note that GRAPHISOFT operates and provides its services with close cooperation with its subsidiaries (GRAPHISOFT GROUP) therefore the electronic systems of GRAPHISOFT (where most of our products are marketed and are available) are designed to share the information indicated on the Personal Data Information Sheet(s) within the GRAPHISOFT GROUP. Based on this system structure it may occur that the data processed by GRAPHISOFT SE are shared with a GRAPHISOFT subsidiary or subsidiaries while being processed or GRAPHISOFT subsidiaries share personal information with GRAPHISOFT.
In all cases internal policies and procedures regulate the access to the databases to ensure that while we aim to provide the best service possible all data processing are in compliance with the legal regulations.

However, since GRAPHISOFT has always added considerable weight to the privacy of personal data, GRAPHISOFT appoints a data protection officer and dedicated sufficient staff, resources to ensure that it is able to discharge its obligations under the GDPR.

2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Personal data shall be:
processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’)
collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with GDPR, not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);
processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).

the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes – i.e. if you signed a consent form or given your consent via electronic means (pressing consent button or link, or giving consent over recorded telephone etc.).
processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract – i.e. in case you are or want to be in a contractual relationship with GRAPHISOFT and the processing of your data is necessary for the performance of the contract. Please note that in such case your separate consent is not required, and your data is processed as long and to the extent as required for the performance of the contract.
processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject – i.e. in case a EU or national piece of legislation prescribes for GRAPHISOFT to process your data (data of invoices, data of customer complaints etc.). Please note that in such case also your separate consent is not required, and your data is processed as long and to the extent as required and prescribed by law.
processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

6. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DOES GRAPHISOFT USE THEM?
6.1 A cookie is a small piece of information that will be stored on your hard disk until you delete it. Like most websites and applications, we use our own cookies and those of third parties, together with similar technologies, to make our websites and applications work, to offer you customized and personalized service, and to learn more about our users and their likely interests. Cookies themselves don't hold personal information. They only have a unique alphanumeric identifier that sits on your browser. And in many cases, we won’t be able to link the information we collect by using a cookie back to you. They can, however, enable us to link that information back to you and your personal information, for example, when you log in, or choose to register for a service, product or newsletter.
6.2 GRAPHISOFT and third-party vendors including Google and Facebook use first-party and third-party cookies and related user behaviour tracking technologies to measure desktop software, mobile application and website usage; record different user activities in its software and on its web sites; and display advertisements based on the user’s previously recorded activities.

7.4 It is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest to prevent and respond to fraud, to defend our Websites and applications against attacks, to protect the property and safety of GRAPHISOFT, our customers, users, the public. That is why our distributors and specific companies are retained as data processors to assist us to combat piracy. Please note that it is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest from the above reasons not to identify our service providers. We share Your IP address, MAC address, software version and language with them exclusively for the above purposes.
7.5 Further to the above as indicated earlier GRAPHISOFT provides its services in close cooperation with its subsidiaries therefore it is frequent that a GRAPHISOFT subsidiary acts as data processor on behalf of GRAPHISOFT.
(B) DISCLOSURE TO OTHER DATA CONTROLLERS
7.6 In other cases, we provide your data to other entities to use such data under their own name and for their own benefit. Sometimes we may need to do this to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we need to provide certain Transaction, Technical or Identify Data to the police or other authorities), and in other cases, we rely on other legal grounds, such as our legitimate interests or your written (including electronic means) consent.
7.7 Accordingly, if you consent to the sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT may also share your Identity Data, Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with GRAPHISOFT’s subsidiaries, and distributors  Please note that we do not share personal information about consumers with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that sharing.
7.8 We may share or publish Aggregate Data that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use our applications.
7.9 We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and the data processing contract if any. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
(C) MAKING YOUR DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BY YOU
7.10 There are several places on GRAPHISOFT’s websites and applications that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you might be able to limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other members of the website or application. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you do not want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control who sees your post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.
7.11 To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us.
8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
8.1 As indicated above, we share your personal data within the GRAPHISOFT Group and with our Distributors as follows:
You provide us with certain personal data when registering at our Websites. In such case, if you consent to the sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT as data controller may also share your Identity Data, Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with GRAPHISOFT’s local subsidiaries and distributor(s) corresponding to your registered address who will be data controller(s) too.
Distributors and subsidiaries use the online ordering system of GRAPHISOFT and when using it may fill in certain personal information about you. This is always the decision of the given distributor/subsidiary. In such case the distributor/subsidiary is the data controller and GRAPHISOFT is only data processor of the distributor/subsidiary in order to provide the electronic ordering system.
These transfers will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ).
8.2 Also, since many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) (such as Microsoft, Inc., Digital Ocean, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc.), so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
8.3 Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of EEA, we contractually ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
8.4 Please do contact us if you need further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside of EEA.
9. IS MY PERSONAL DATA SECURE, AND WHERE WILL IT BE STORED?
9.1 We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. All information you provide us is stored on secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot warrant or guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. In case your data is provided by registering on our websites than we ensure that this registration is completed on a secured platform where we apply our security measures. In case you would like to have more information on the specific security measures taken in order to save your data than please contact us.
9.2 Also, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
9.3 Finally, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
9.4 Your personal information and data files are stored on GRAPHISOFT’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. As shown in clause 7 above, your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world (for example, Germany, Ireland, the United States). As mentioned in clause 7 above, the data that we collect from you may therefore be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the provision of support services.
