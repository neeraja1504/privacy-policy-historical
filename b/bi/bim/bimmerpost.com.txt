Last Updated: May 18, 2018
BIMMERPOST knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting BIMMERPOST, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
The term BIMMERPOST refers to BIMMERPOST.com and all related domains referred to as "The Site" in our Terms of Service.
What Personal Information About Users Does BIMMERPOST Store?
The information provided to BIMMERPOST is varied but limited in scope and is provided by you.
Information You Give Us : With registration, we store the registered username, registered e-mail address, IP address, registered password, birthday, date of registration and subsequent dates of site visit, social media contact information. Your password is encoded in such a way that we cannot retrieve your raw password. This information is stored locally.
E-mail : Occasionally, when really big news comes across our desk, we will send out an e-mail to your registered address to inform you of this news. You have the option to opt-out of any emails sent from our website by selecting the option in our user control panel. We do not under any circumstances sell, trade or otherwise give out e-mail addresses. No ifs ands or buts!
You may see a comprehensive list of all the personal data being stored under your account at any time by visiting our Personal Data Portal
User Generated Content, Online Communities and Forums, Profiles, Surveys, Reviews and Ratings
You may choose to publicly disclose personal information about yourself and others in the course of (i) contributing user generated content (for instance articles, blogs, surveys, reviews, ratings, or podcasts), (ii) communicating with others in our online forums, communities, or chat rooms, (iii) creating user profiles for public view, or (iv) posting images, photos, or videos. Be aware, information that you voluntarily disclose in any of these areas of our sites or services is unencrypted, public information and, therefore, there can be no expectation of privacy or confidentiality, except if the terms of use of the site or service specifically limit use of the content (for example, we may let you know how such survey and rating responses will be used and if anonymity is an option). Any personal information you submit in the course of interacting in these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users. Prior to posting in these areas, we encourage you to read the specific site's or service's terms of use, as we are not responsible for the personal information you choose to make public in any of these areas and strongly recommend against sharing any personal health or other sensitive information that could directly or indirectly be traced to any individual, including yourself.
What About Cookies and other tracking technologies?
We or our third-party service providers may collect and store certain technical information when you use our sites and services. For example, our servers receive and automatically collect information about your computer and browser, including, for instance, your IP address, browser type, domain name from which you accessed the site or service, device size and other software or hardware information. If you access our sites and services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (UDID), type of device, general GPS location, or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it and to improve your experience in using the sites or services.
In addition, we or our third-party service providers may collect information about how you use of our sites, including but not limited to, the date and time you visit the sites, the areas or pages of the sites that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the sites, the number of times you return to the sites, visits to sites outside our network, preferred language, and other click-stream data.
We or our third-party service providers may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, mobile application identifiers, and Adobe Flash technology) to help us recognize you across different sites and services, improve your experience, increase security, measure use and effectiveness of our services, and serve advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. For more information about our use of cookies, please read our Cookie Policy.
By visiting our sites and services, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this privacy policy and our Cookie Policy.
You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative, Omniture, Aperture, PrivacyChoice, and/or Digital Advertising Alliance.
We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals. Accordingly, your navigation on our sites and services may be tracked as part of our efforts to gather user information described above. If you arrive at our sites and services by way of a link from a third-party site that does respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals, such “Do Not Track” browser signal recognition will end as soon as you reach our sites and services.
Does BIMMERPOST Share the Information It Receives?
Information security about our users is important to us, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We do not share user information with anyone, with the following exceptions:
Protection of BIMMERPOST and Others : We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of BIMMERPOST, our users, or others. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
Business Transfers : As we continue to develop this site, we might sell services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that BIMMERPOST is acquired, user information will of course be included in the transaction.
Your Consent
Other than as set out above, you will always receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
What About Third-Party Advertisers?
Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.
These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content (such as Google through the Google AdSense program). This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your registration information on our servers and encrypt your passwords with the strictest algorithms.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
What Choices and Access Do I Have?
You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to particapte in the forum discussion.
You can add or update certain information, such as your e-mail address, by using our User Administration pages. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of BIMMERPOST's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
