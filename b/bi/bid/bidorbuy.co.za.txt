Cookies and other tracking technologies
A cookie is a small data file that writes to your device in order to collect and remember certain information including personally identifiable information about the user. Cookies are used, but without limitation, to store your Alias/Username and Password so that you do not need to type these in each time you log in or make a bid, thereby saving time whilst on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still browse our site. However, in order to log in and bid or sell, cookies are required to be turned on.
There are two sorts of cookies used on our site: session cookies and persistent cookies. Once you close your browser, the session cookie simply terminates, whereas the persistent cookie remains to enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site.
Bidorbuy may make use of other tracking technologies including, but not limited to, web beacons which are small graphic images or other web-programming code included in webpages and email messages and/or embedded scripts placed on the website designed to collect information about your interactions with any given website. These technologies are used in order to collect certain information which may also include personally identifiable information for purposes such as fraud detection and improvement of our website amongst others.
Bidorbuy employs the services of third parties in its use of the above technologies and whilst Bidorbuy takes every precaution to ensure the loss, misuse, alteration and confidentiality of all information in our possession we have little control over information not in our possession.

Surveys And Contests
From time-to-time we request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose any information to us.

Security
We take every precaution to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of all information under our control. When you submit sensitive information via our site, your information is protected both online and offline.
When our registration form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using SSL. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
If you have any questions about the security at our site, you can send an email to hello@bidorbuy.com.
