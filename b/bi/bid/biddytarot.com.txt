What cookies do we use?
When you visit our Site, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:
Analytical and Performance Cookies
We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of the Site by using cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the Site, how long they stay and how they move around the Site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. The information generated relating to the Site may be used to create reports about the use of the Site and the analytics service provider will also store this information.
Advertising and Targeting Cookies
These cookies record your visit to the Site, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other Sites. We will use this information to try and make the Site more relevant to your interests.
We work with technology partners to support the Site and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with. We may use cookies on our Site to help us to place relevant Biddy Tarot advertising on others’ sites when you visit such sites. We do this because we value your visit to our Site and hope that you will be interested in other Biddy Tarot offerings when you visit other sites. If you are not happy with this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off below”.

Third Party Cookies
We know you love to share the great content we have on the Site so we try to make it as easy as possible to do so. We add buttons to allow people to easily share on networks like Facebook and Twitter. We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the Site.
Please note that when we include such social ‘plugins’, it gives those social networking site the flexibility to use cookies. They can’t read any cookies we set from the Site, and we can’t read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the Site, and it also lets them know whether you’re logged in. For example, if you’re logged in to Facebook, read one of our blog posts and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in to the Site again – we never know whether you’re logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.
We don’t control the setting of these third-party cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.
Our internet service providers may also use other standard web-based technologies to analyze your movements while accessing our Site. The technologies include analytic solutions, web “beacons,” “pixel tags,” and “clear gifs.” These technologies help us ascertain the effectiveness of our product and service campaigns and marketing programs, allow us to customize the services offered on or through our Site, and help determine the best use for Site content, and product and service offerings. Some of this information, including the IP address, may be stored on our internet service provider’s server logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.
