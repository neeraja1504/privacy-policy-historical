Security of your personal data
Luno places great importance on ensuring the security of your personal data. We regularly review and implement up-to-date technical and organisational security measures when processing your personal data. Employees of Luno are trained to handle personal data securely and with the utmost respect, failing which they may be subject to disciplinary action.
Global company
The personal data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and the laws of those countries may differ from the laws applicable in your own country. For example, data collected in the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination(s) outside of the EEA. Any processing of such data will be undertaken by our staff, or the staff of our third-party service providers, whose roles will include verifying your identity, processing payment details, and providing customer support.
By accepting this Privacy policy, and then submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of it outside of your jurisdiction.
Additional matters relating to personal data
Retention of personal data
Luno will retain your personal data, in compliance with this Privacy policy and the Terms of use, for the duration of your relationship with us, and afterwards for such period as may be necessary for our legitimate business purposes (including compliance with our legal obligations, preventing fraud, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements), to protect the interests of Luno and its customers, and as required by law.
Incomplete personal data
Where indicated (for example in application forms or account opening forms), it is obligatory to provide your personal data to us to enable us to process your application for our products or services. Should you decline to provide such personal data, we may not be able to process your application/request or provide you with our products or services.
Your right to access, update, or remove your personal data
Most of the data Luno collects, and the ways in which we use it, are necessary for us to provide and improve the services we provide to you, or to comply with our obligations. In certain situations, we give you the ability to choose how we use your data.
Depending on the country in which you live, you may have certain rights under data protection law, including the right to object to the processing of your personal data or to request that we:
provide you with a copy of your personal data (including in a format that can be shared with a new provider); or
correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data.
Please submit a support ticket if you would like to exercise any of the above rights. These rights are limited in some situations, such as where we are legally required to process your data, and may limit your ability to use our products and services.
Data breaches
We will notify you and the relevant supervisory authority as soon as we become aware of any data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms.
Credit and debit card data
We do not store your full credit and debit card data. This data is securely transferred and stored off-site by an authorised payment vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to Luno or Luno’s employees or any agent acting for or on behalf of Luno.

We may amend this Privacy policy from time to time. You should visit the website regularly to check when this Privacy policy was last updated and to review the current policy.
