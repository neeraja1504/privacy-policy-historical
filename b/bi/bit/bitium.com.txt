We may need to disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, service providers and business partners solely for the purpose of providing Bitium Services to you. In such cases Bitium will also ensure that such affiliates, service providers and business partners comply with this Privacy Policy and adopt appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any Personal Information regarding users with our business partners and advertisers.

In addition, we may also disclose Personal Information and contents of your user account upon a lawful request by government authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements if disclosure is determined to be necessary by Bitium in our sole and absolute discretion for protecting the safety of our users, employees, or the general public.
Bitium shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles for onward transfers to its agents, if its agent processes Privacy Shield information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Bitium can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
7. Legal Requests
Bitium requires appropriate legal process (i.e., subpoena, court order, or other valid process) before disclosing non-public user account information. In the United States, this means Bitium requires a search warrant before disclosing to law enforcement the contents of non-public user communications. Bitium will not provide any non-public user information to non-U.S. law enforcement agencies without a valid U.S. court order (via the mutual legal assistance treaties or letter rogatory). Bitium will attempt to notify users of law enforcement requests for information except where (1) we are legally prohibited from providing notice (e.g. by an order under 18 U.S.C. 2705(b)); (2) an emergency situation exists involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person; or (3) we have reason to believe notice wouldn’t go to the actual account holder (e.g. an account has been hijacked).
8. Security
We follow industry appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information, username, password, transaction information and data stored in your user account. Access to your name and email address is restricted to our employees who need to know such information in connection with providing Bitium Services to you and are bound by confidentiality obligations.
9. Information Choices
You will be required to register for our Bitium Services by providing Personal Information. If you choose not to provide your Personal Information, you will not be able to access the Bitium Services. We provide you with the option of opting out from receiving non-transactional mail from us.
