Privacy Policy - Bitesize Bio
(Last Updated: December 15, 2014)
At BitesizeBio (“BSB,” “we,” or “us”), we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how personal information is collected from users of the BitesizeBio website at www.bitesizebio.com (the “Site”), and how that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy.
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time and will notify you of such changes by posting the modified Policy on our Site and indicating at the top of the Policy document the date it was last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such changes shall constitute your consent to any changes to BitesizeBio’s privacy practices.
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Personal Information :
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card (or other account number) when directly linked to him or her, such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies an individual.
Aggregate Information :
Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data collected about a group or category of products, services or customers from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services (including the Site) to customer desires.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit the Site.
For example, you provide us with personal information when you:
Create an account and subscribe to our e-mail newsletter or other
services (“Services”)
Conduct a transaction through the Site
Participate in a survey, contest, or other promotion on the Site
Contact us by e-mail for any reason, such as to request help with
the Services, or to provide us with your comments/feedback
Submit personal information in connection with photos/stories for
potential use and/or publication on the Site
We may collect your name, image, billing and shipping addresses, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date in this manner. We may also collect certain demographic information in connection with your participation in any survey, contest, sweepstakes, or promotion on the Site. You understand that when you submit information to us, including but not limited to comments, stories, photos, or videos (“Content”), for participation in any survey, contest, sweepstakes, or promotion offered on the Site, that BitesizeBio may post or publish this information on the Site, and that you also agree BitesizeBio has an unlimited right to use your Content. Your participation in such surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions offered on the Site, and associated information sharing, is done at your own risk – Please keep this in mind.
Important Note: You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, stories, comments and elsewhere on the Site. If you choose to use your real name (or include any personally identifying information as part of your “nickname”) that information will be publicly displayed on our Site where noted. Therefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified on the Site.
Additionally, when you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected, such as your computer’s operating system and browser type, version, and capabilities (such as whether JavaScript is enabled and cookies are accepted), your Internet Protocol (IP) address and the time and date of your visit, the referring site (if applicable), as well as screen resolution, color and depth. This information is tracked through the use of web beacons and logs.
Cookies : Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your browser at the request of a web site to store your personal preferences. BitesizeBio may use cookies and your internet protocol (IP) address for certain functions to better your online experience.
Web Beacons : “Web beacons” (also known as “web bugs,” “action tags,” “pixel trackers,” or “clear GIFs”) may also be used on the Site or in e-mails relating to the Site. Web beacons are small graphic images placed on a webpage, web-based document, or in an e-mail message that allow the collection of certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. Web beacons are invisible because of their size (only 1 by 1 pixel) and because they are the same color as the background of the web page.
We do not use Web beacons to collect personal information about you. Web beacons are used to collect non-personal information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user comes from and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the webpage, advertisement, or e-mail that contains the Web beacon).
We use cookies on this site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by websites to offer a personalised service and improve the site. Cookies are widely used. By continuing to use this site, you are consenting to our use of cookies. More – Cookie Policy

SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION
