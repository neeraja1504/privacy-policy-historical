CredoEx Privacy Policy
Effective: March 11, 2018
CredoEx (“Company,” “we” or “us”) respects the privacy of our website visitors. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose information in connection with this CredoEx.com website and any other CredoEx online resources (including mobile applications) that link to this policy (collectively, the “Sites”). By using one of our Sites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy.
Information We Collect
We collect both Personal Information and Other Information about visitors to our Sites, as described below. For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means information we can directly associate with a specific individual without any additional information, such as a name, an email address, a physical address, or a phone number. “Other Information” means any information that is not Personal Information. We may combine Other Information and Personal Information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
We may also combine Personal Information or Other Information we have about you with additional information that we or third parties collect in other contexts – like if you contact us by phone or email and provide information we did not already have, or when third-parties share information about you with us. In those circumstances, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.
Personal Information
Your Account: We collect Personal Information from you when you provide it to us by creating a CredoEx account. Depending on the type of account you create, we may collect your:
First and last name
Email address
Phone number
Physical address
A government-issued identification number
A copy of your government issued identification card (such as a driver’s license)
Proof of address
We will associate this account information with other information about your use of CredoEx, including your preferences and other account settings, your transactions, your account balance, your customer service or support requests, and [anything else?].
We also allow you to combine your CredoEx account with your BitBounce.com account (if you have one). If you choose to combine your accounts, we will collect information about your BitBounce.com account automatically. The BitBounce.com privacy policy is available here: https://bitbounce.com/privacy_policy.
The Sites may also include community sections where you can post questions, comments, or other inquiries related to CredoEx. Your posts will include your account name and be visible to other members of the CredoEx community and the general public. You are responsible for ensuring that you do not post information you wish to keep private or confidential.
Other Personal Information: The Sites may allow you to contact us by email, web chat, or other means. We collect the information you provide to us through such communications, which might include your name, phone number, and email address.
The Sites may allow you to submit a resume or other information to apply for employment or other opportunities at CredoEx. We will collect your resume and other requested information you submit in association with your application.
Other Information. We also collect Other Information automatically when you visit our Sites. This may include information such as your IP address and domain name, your Internet service provider, the time and duration of your visit, how you used the Sites (including pages viewed and actions taken), the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Sites, how you were referred to our Sites, your operating system and browser type, your software and hardware attributes (including device type), your MAC address, and your general geographic location (for example, your city, state, or metropolitan region). We collect this information using the following technologies:
Server Logs. When you use the Sites, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. To obtain such information, we may use server logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.
Cookies. We also use cookies on the Sites. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or other device by your web browser. A cookie allows the Sites to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and Other Information and may be used as described below and in the “Third-Party Analytics and Advertising” section. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer or other device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Site may not operate correctly.
Pixel tags. The Sites or the emails that you receive from us may use an application known as a “pixel tag” (also known as a “clear gif” or “web beacon”). A pixel tag is an electronic tracking mechanism that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page, an online display advertisement, or in an email to transmit information, which could include Personal Information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email or an online display advertisement.
We may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the information described above. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use pixel tags on the Sites, in email communications from us, and in connection with delivering display advertisements from us or others. This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including analytics (such as how many emails or online ads were opened) and targeted advertising, as described in the “Third-Party Analytics and Targeted Advertising” section below.

Third-Party Analytics and Targeted Advertising
We partner with certain third parties to collect Other Information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may use web logs, pixel tags, or other tracking mechanisms, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or device. Our Sites use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here.
Certain portions of the Sites may also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect Other Information over time and across unaffiliated websites for use in online behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target online ads for CredoEx services to you on non-CredoEx websites. In addition, our third-party advertising partners might use information about your use of the Sites to help target non-CredoEx advertisements based on your online behavior in general. For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website or the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies. Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out here, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by opting out here.
Our website currently does not respond to “do not track” browser headers.
Security
Our Site uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal and Other Information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program is foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.

Your California Privacy Rights
California law gives residents of California the right, under certain circumstances, to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To request such information, please contact us at the information provided below.

To obtain removal of such content or information, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information you would like removed to [insert contact address].

We may also subcontract the processing of your data, or otherwise share your data with, affiliates or third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence.
