B. COLLECTED INFORMATION
Personally identifiable information We Collect
Most of the Products and Services offered to visitors of the Website require you to register for a user account with Bitrix24 ("User Account"). When registering for a User Account, Bitrix24 will ask you to voluntarily supply Bitrix24 with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. Such information may include your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. It is completely optional for you to register for a User Account or engage in activities requiring a User Account.
When ordering Products and Services via the Website, you may be asked to provide a credit card number, account and/or billing and shipping information enabling the consummation of the transaction. The foregoing information is collected and processed by online payment services, including but not limited to merchant accounts services, which we may utilize for payment processing, including automatic subscription renewals. In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to product updates.
You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Products and Services. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. Bitrix24 will inform you of the mandatory and/or optional character of the requested and/or required information.
You may be provided an opportunity to subscribe to a periodic newsletter and product updates. This newsletter allows Bitrix24 to inform you of new Products and Services, updates, as well as other news relevant to the company. The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name, your email address, and other information. Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent.
Non-Personally identifiable information we collect
When you use the Website, Bitrix24 or trusted third parties authorized by Bitrix24 may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and its services. When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to Bitrix24 every time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you visited, the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version that you are using to access the Website. All of this information may be collected by Bitrix24 and used to help improve our offerings to you.
Bitrix24 may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually.
We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services. Bitrix24 also uses environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website. We do not match such information with any of your personally identifiable information.
Browsing
The Website collects non-personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with your personally identifiable information, Bitrix24 will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect this information in order to make the Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on the Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use the Website and how we can better adjust the Website, its contents, and functionality to meet the needs of our users. We do not match such information with any of your personally identifiable information.
Files
Bitrix24 collects and stores the files you upload, download, or access via the Products and Services offered through the Website. We understand that these files may be confidential or contain sensitive information. Accordingly, Bitrix24 does not share or permit third parties to access such files. However, no password-protected system of data storage and retrieval can be made entirely impenetrable. Although Bixtrix24 uses a number of security technologies and procedures to make sure that the data on the Website is secure, it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to access, view, copy, modify and distribute the data and files you store on the Website or via Products and Services despite Bitrix24's efforts.
Your User Account and Public profile
As described above, you will be given an opportunity to create a User Account containing your personal information. A User Account is required for using most Products and Services offered on the Website.
Your public profile
Once the User Account is created, you may provide additional information to your profile, access, review and update your account information online via the Website.
Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required for the account creation is entirely up to you. Any information you provide at registration or in your profile section may be used by us as described in our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. You can review the personal information you provide to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish at any time by logging in to your account on the Website.
If you wish to deactivate your User Account, you can do so through the User Account interface or by contacting Bitrix24 at privacy@bitrix24.com. When you deactivate your User Account, all information stored and maintained as part of your account will be deleted from our servers, including the files you stored via the Website or its Products and Services.
Information Relating to Children
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 without the consent of the child's holder of parental responsibility. You must be 16 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction in order to use our Website, Products or Services. If you are under 16 years old, you may only use our website with your parent or legal guardian's permission. Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child by contacting us by letter (using the address information provided at the bottom of this page) or email to privacy@bitrix24.com.
Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
Bitrix24 is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information.
In particular, we use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your Personal Data. We apply the security measures foreseen in the applicable regulations as well as our own technical and organizational security measures including policy, governance, procedures, responsibilities, risk assessment; network and subprocessor security.
Bitrix24 operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Bitrix24 takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and so we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted through the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
We treat the information you provide to us, including the Files, as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Bitrix24, it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Bitrix24. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Bitrix24 and its service providers conduct business. All Bitrix24 employees are obligated by our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who perform technical support of the service.
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving any site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
How Your Personal Information Is Used
On Contract Lawful basis
If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, such information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. We also use your personal information for registering you for an account or for a webinar, sending a confirmation e-mail, responding to your requests and helping to process the purchase or service you have selected, communicating with you when you contact a sales consultant or authorized partner, processing, fulfilling, and following up on transactions for our products and services, support, and training, to process any request by you for information or advice, to manage your account and content that you upload, to deal with enquiries, complaints and feedback from you and our partners;
Based on our Legitimate interests
Bitrix24 may use aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes to help improve our offerings to you, to help diagnose any problems with our server and administer the Website or to improve your browsing experience by personalising the Website;
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.
Based on our Legitimate interests and Your consent
We use your personal information to develop and conduct our business. Some examples of how we use personal information include: improving our products and services; personalizing communications with you; conducting market research; conducting customer surveys; engaging in more targeted, customer-specific advertising; processing.
Bitrix24 collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.
Based on your consent, your personal information also may be used to keep you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of Bitrix24 and selected third parties if you have consented to receive such communications.
When you create a User Account with Bitrix24 and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to Bitrix24 offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Bitrix24 has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We may use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails to you. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Bitrix24 related e-mail. If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information, please unsubscribe by sending email to: unsubscribe@bitrix24.com. In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. You may also opt-out online by updating your User Account as described in the User Account section of this Privacy Policy (above).
Legal obligation
We may hold some of your information for complying with legal requirements and enforcing our website terms of use or otherwise protecting our legal rights.
We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.
Bitrix24 is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.
Disclosure of your personal data to Third Parties
Bitrix24 uses services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, voice and messaging application ("VMA"), purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Bitrix24. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Bitrix24 specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Bitrix24's affiliates for their use without your approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you hereby acknowledge and agree that third party services described in this paragraph are subject to such party's terms of services and privacy policies, links to which can be provided to you upon request as set forth in Section D of this Privacy Policy.
Bitrix24 may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Bitrix24 may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company (such as the Terms of Service) or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
Bitrix24 may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, Bitrix24 will provide this information upon receipt of appropriate documentation. Bitrix24 may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute.
In the event that all or substantially all of Bitrix24's stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Bitrix24 may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
Where we store your personal data
The Personal Data that we collect from you is transferred to, and stored inside European Economic Area. We may also provide information to third party service providers who, as data processors, will only process information on our behalf and under our instructions to help run some of our internal business operations including email distribution, payment services providers or to provide advertising on the Website. These recipients, both service providers and Bitrix 24 entities may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area or elsewhere in the world, such as for example the United States of America, that do not offer an equivalent level of protection of privacy as in the European Economic Area. Different privacy laws may apply in these countries and you understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of personal information to these countries, group companies and service providers. These transfers might be necessary for the performance of the agreement between you and Bitrix24. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect any information held in that country or that the service provider acts at all times in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Where required under applicable laws we will take measures to ensure that personal information handled in other countries will receive at least the same level of protection as it is given in your home country and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
D. YOUR CHOICES, RIGHTS AND PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS
Choices Available to You
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website.

You can choose at any time to opt out of receiving emails from Bitrix24 or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you wish to opt out, you can do so by editing your User Account preferences with respect to e-mail or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.
