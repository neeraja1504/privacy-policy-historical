BitBin
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which BitBin collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the http://www.bitbin.it website ("Site"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by BitBin.
Collected information
BitBin collects and processes various types of information in order to operate the site. The information includes:
IP address. An anonymized version of your IP address is saved when viewing pages and posting information on BitBin. This is done to count paste hits accurately, and to help detect fraudulent activity such as automated traffic or spam.
Username and password. If you register to this site, your username and a cryptographic hash of your password will be stored to securely identify and authenticate you.
Paste text. Any paste text you upload will be stored until the paste is deleted. Paste text is stored and displayed in clear text by default: you can use BitBin's client-side encryption to encrypt your paste if you wish to. In this case, BitBin only stores and serves an encrypted copy of the paste text.
User data. If you have registered as an user, BitBin stores other data such as records of cryptocurrency transactions, whether your favorites are public, and other data you have changed or created during your activities on the site. This information is preserved until the deletion of your user account, at which point they may be deleted or stripped of personally identifying data.
Cookies. BitBin uses web cookies to allow you to login and use the features available to logged in users.
Browser information. Non-identifying browser information, such as the web browser name and version. If BitBin fails to fulfill a request due to a technical issue, BitBin will collect such data related to the request in order to help discover and fix the issue.
Data stored by BitBin is NOT shared with third-parties. Copies of data hosted outside BitBin's server(s) are transferred and stored in an encrypted format, with only BitBin having access to the unencrypted, original data.
