Privacy Policy
What we won't do
We won't sell or share your information to anyone outside Biznik, period. We won't publish your email address, or your physical address (if someone wants to contact you, they'll have to use the forms we provide on the site, which will send you an email indirectly -- keep in mind, though, that sending email this way will reveal your email address to whomever you contact, and if they choose to reply, you will know their email, too).
What we do publish
The whole point of being a member is to let the world know about your services. So of course, most of the information you provide us we will publish on the Biznik website. But you can decide what that information is. If there is sensitive information in your educational background, for example, simply don't include that information on your profile.
