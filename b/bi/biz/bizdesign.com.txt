BizSecure : Privacy Policy
In the course of serving its customers, BizSecure acquires, stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private or sensitive. Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to BizSecure by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by BizSecure in the normal course of providing service.

Also, please note that use of BizSecure's website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
BizSecure's policies and procedures for handling customer information have been created with the understanding that Internet technologies are still evolving and that Internet business methods are continuing to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities of the changing technologies.

Data Security
BizSecure protects the confidentiality of its customers' information, account information and personal communications. To secure the information collected online, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure only appropriate use of information that is collected from customers, BizSecure has implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, for information stored online and offline. Further, BizSecure requires that employees who have access keep customer information confidential.
When customers submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, such as the BizSecure Hosting order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when customers are just 'surfing'.
BizSecure uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once received. For example, BizSecure stores personal information provided by customers on computer systems with limited access, that are located in secured manned facilities. BizSecure's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@bizsecure.com.
BizSecure cautions its customers and website visitors that no medium of communication, including the Internet, is entirely secure.
