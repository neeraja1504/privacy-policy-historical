4.1. Cookies: A cookie is a small file placed on your computer’s hard drive (“Cookies”). It enables Bizagi’s Websites to identify your computer and collect information about how you browse Bizagi’s Websites. Cookies allow Bizagi’s Websites to: 1. store your preferences to present content, options or functions that are specific to you; and, 2. enable us to see information like how many people use the website and what pages they tend to visit.

Flash cookies are used to remember the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like regular cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia website privacy settings panel at macromedia.com.
4.2. Embedded URLs: Bizagi may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow the use of the electronic Channels without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Channels, but are not associated with Data and are not used beyond the session.
4.3. Embedded Pixels and Similar Technologies: On the electronic Channels, Bizagi and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies to identify unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits) and for advertising purposes. Also, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's e-mail address.
4.4. Widgets, Buttons, and Tools: Our electronic Channels may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies' services (e.g., a "Like" button or third-party map). The widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send Data, such as your e-mail address, or other information (such as your browser information, or IP address), to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
4.5. Physical Location: Bizagi may collect and share the physical location of your device for purposes consistent with this Privacy Statement, such as to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.
4.6. Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data: As is true of most websites, Bizagi gathers specific information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer Bizagi’s Websites and Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use Bizagi’s Websites and Services, Bizagi automatically receives the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave Bizagi’s Websites. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve Bizagi’s Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide Bizagi’s Websites and Services. For example, Bizagi uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Bizagi’s Websites. Bizagi also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Bizagi’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
4.7. Social Media Features and Single Sign-on: Bizagi’s Websites may use social media features, such as the LinkedIn “like” button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Bizagi Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on Bizagi’s Websites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party social media network to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Bizagi’s Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features. Bizagi also allows you to log in to certain of Bizagi’s Websites and Services using sign-in services such as Linkedin, Microsoft and Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
4.8. Do Not Track: Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Bizagi does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals concerning the Bizagi Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Bizagi takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
5. Public forums refer a contact, and customer testimonials
