PRIVACY POLICY
We respect your privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information when you visit our sites, unless you choose to provide such information by contacting us or by making a purchase. When you do provide us with personal or contact information, we use this information only for the purpose you intended, for example, to email you a quotation or to answer a question. In short, you will never receive any communication from Biz-Logo.com that you didn't specifically ask to receive.
In addition we do not rent, sell or in any other way share your personal or contact information with anyone. Ever. If you choose to write a testimonial for use on our web site, your email address will only be made available to prospective customers and only on request. We will not publish your email address with your testimonial - nor anywhere else.
We do not make use of cookies.
We are passionately anti-spam. We will send you only that which you ask to receive, such as logo files or an answer to a question.
Biz-Logo.com may display your designs, your comments and/or design feedback on its web site and related web sites after completion of the design project, provided that the logo and/or other designs are displayed as portfolio pieces and not offered for sale. We do however understand that your project may be confidential and that you may not want the designs made public prior to the launch of your product or service. In such cases you must very specifically ask that the designs be excluded from our portfolio. While we cannot guarantee that we will exclude your designs from our portfolio, we normally would have no problem excluding them for a period not exceeding 12 months. We also make exceptions for designers who resell our logos to their clients, but only by prior arrangement with Biz-Logo management.
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please get in touch.
