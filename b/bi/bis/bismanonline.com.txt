2. Cookies and third-party advertising
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the site for creating better recommendations and user experiences. We will use session cookies to follow how you navigate the site. We will use persistent cookies to enable the site to recognize you when you visit.
Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiration date. We use these cookies to better serve you with the kinds of content that we feel may be of interest to you.
We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of the site. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about the site use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to the site is used to create reports about the use of the site. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when users visit our site. These companies may use general information (not including personal information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements on our site, other websites, and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, while some browsers allow you to reject just third-party cookies. Blocking any cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

We will not provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing without your explicit consent.
