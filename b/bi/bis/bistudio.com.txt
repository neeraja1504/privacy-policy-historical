Updated: 25.5.2018
Hello visitor!
If you're reading this, it means you value your privacy and data protection as much as we do. Our privacy policy sets out to be as transparent as possible with regards to what we do with the user data we collect from those who sign up for a Bohemia Account, play our games, visit our websites, and/or make use of our other online services. It has been prepared with the utmost care, and has been reviewed to be in accordance with the applicable legislation, including the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Union.
Here are some quick takeaways that we think are most important for you:
We only store user data to:
ensure the proper functionality of our games and related online services such as our forums and Feedback Tracker;
fulfill our obligations when you make a purchase on the Bohemia Store;
send you newsletters with the latest news on our projects and sales. You can subscribe/unsubscribe at any time by updating your Bohemia Account e-mail preferences.
For some of our games we collect anonymous player data to learn how people play the game and how we can make the game experience better. You can opt-in/opt-out via the game’s settings.
We’ll never sell your personal data to third-parties. Some data can be shared with certain partners such as server hosting providers or analytics services. These partners have signed a strict non-disclosure agreement. You’ll find a precise overview of what data is shared with who in Appendix No. 2 of our privacy policy.
We’re constantly taking proactive measures to make sure all data is stored in a safe manner according to the latest security standards.
