Privacy Policy - NaturalNews.com
Effective Date: 5/25/18
This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Natural News Network ("NaturalNews", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 25th May 2018. Here at NaturalNews.com, we are committed to you and to protecting your privacy rights. We are committed to fulfilling our responsibilities under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in relation to the collection, retention, use, and other processing of personal data that is obtained when EU data subjects visit and interact with the Site. We may use it to periodically inform you about changes on our Web Site and new products and services. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any person or entity not authorized by or associated with us.
NaturalNews's Privacy Commitment
NaturalNews ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements.
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
Scope of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to the products and services provided by NaturalNews through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by NaturalNews on NaturalNews' websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is divided into two parts:
Part I – Information NaturalNews.com collects and controls
This part deals with how NaturalNews collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of NaturalNews's products and services, and others who contact NaturalNews through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.
Part II – General
This part deals with topics that are relevant to other general topics such as NaturalNews's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.
