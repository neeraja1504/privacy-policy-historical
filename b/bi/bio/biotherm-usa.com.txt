WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
“Personal Information” means any information or pieces of information that could identify you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly (e.g. through pseudonymized data such as a unique ID number). In other words, personal data includes things like email/home addresses/mobile phone, usernames, profile pictures,beauty profiles, personal preferences and shopping habits, user generated content, financial information, and welfare information. It could also include unique numerical identifiers like your computer’s IP address or your mobile device’s MAC address, as well as cookies.
Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregated information that cannot be tracked back to you personally.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES L’OREAL COLLECT FROM ME?
We may collect information that you provide to us directly, information automatically collected and information from third parties. We may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website, our digital advertising) with information that we have collected via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and allow for more customization.
If you submit any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this policy.
Information that I provide directly
If you register on a Site, make purchases through a Site or one of our stores, join a loyalty program, enter a contest or promotion, submit a beauty profile, consumer survey, photo, video or product review, sign up to receive emails or other offers or communications, we collect and store the information provided, including Personal Information. If you use our virtual try on features, we may collect and store your image(s), for example, if you use social sharing to send your image to a friend or post it online or if you save it to your profile.
**Information that I provide through third party social media platforms  **
We may also offer you the opportunity to engage with our content through third party social media platforms, in which case you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g. name, username, e-mail address, picture). We may use this information to confirm your identity and to personalize your experience.
L’Oréal’s use of social media serves as an extension of its presence on the Internet. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on L’Oréal’s servers. Users who choose to interact with L’Oréal via social media should read the terms of service and privacy policies of these platforms. Please remember that any content submitted to one of our social media platforms can be viewed by the public, so you should be cautious about providing certain personal data e.g. financial information or address details. L’Oréal is not responsible for any harm that results due to posting personal data on one of our social media platforms.
When you engage with L’Oréal Canada through social media, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g. name, username, e-mail address, picture). We may use this information to confirm your identity and to personalize your experience.
Information that is collected automatically
Mobile Services/Apps :
Certain of our mobile apps offer opt–in, geo–location services and push notifications. Geo-location services provide location–based content and services, such as store locators, local weather, promotional offers and other personalized content. Push notifications can include discounts, reminders or details about local events or promotions. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services or push notifications. If you consent to location services, we will collect information about the Wi–fi routers closest to you and the cell IDs of the towers closest to you to provide location–based content and services.
Site Usage Information :
L’Oréal and its third–party service providers may also use a variety of technologies that passively or automatically collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used including but not limited to your browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the pages served to you, the time you browse, preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Sites.
Device Identifiers :
L’Oréal also automatically collects an IP address or other unique identifier information ("Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Sites or on third party websites that publish our advertising. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device by the Device provider when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. For mobile devices, a Device Identifier is a unique string of numbers and letters stored on your mobile device that identifies it. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Sites, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, deliver advertising and gather broad demographic information.
Cookies :
Like many web sites, we use "Cookies," which are data files that are sent through your web browser to your computer when it is used to visit the Sites to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience, including tailoring advertisements. Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Sites and your activities on such social networking sites. Note that cookies may be used and linked to other personal data you have shared with us (such as previous purchases or newsletter subscriptions).
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
Pixels or Web Beacons :
We use pixel tags or web beacons, which are transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email to indicate that a page or email has been viewed or to let your browser retrieve content from another server. These measure the success of our marketing campaigns for example and compile statistics about usage of our sites and services and response rates.
In-Store Analytics:
We may provide in-store technologies (such as Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons) to help personalize and improve your shopping experience. These technologies may require the collection of certain information about your mobile device, such as your MAC address or other device identification information and may permit you to submit personal details for increased levels of personalization, such as your interests, shopping preferences, and sizing information.
Information collected from third parties:
We may receive information from third party partners, such as publishers that run our advertising and retailers who feature our products. This information includes marketing and demographic data, offline records and information from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them. We may also receive information from other companies that collect or aggregate information from publicly available databases or if you consented to allow them to use and share your information. This might be de-identified information about purchasing patterns, location of shoppers and sites that are of interest to our consumers. We also collect information about users who share common interests or attributes (e.g. color treated hair) to create user “segments,” which help us to better understand and market to our customers. We may use your data as part of health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as dry skin.
We may combine such third party data with other information we receive from or about you.
Our websites and Apps may from time to time contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we are not responsible or liable for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
WHAT IF I CONNECT TO THE L’OREAL BRANDS’ IN-STORE WI-FI SERVICES?
If you choose to connect to our in-store Wi-Fi services, L’Oréal will receive information about you and your device, including your device’s MAC address, IP address, and technical details about your device such as its operating system and device type (including make and model) and technical capabilities. We will also receive information about how you use our Wi-Fi network while you are connected, including the store location, the areas of the store you visit, the names and/or Internet addresses of the websites you visit and the applications you use, and how long you interact with such sites or applications. We collect this information each time you connect to the Wi-Fi services and may associate it with other information we have collected from and about you.
If your mobile device is configured to search for available Wi-Fi networks, we may receive information about your device even if you choose not to connect to our Wi-Fi services.
For your convenience, we may provide you with an option to stay connected to the L’Oréal Inc. Wi-Fi networks. If you choose this option, you will be automatically logged into the Wi-Fi network of any of our Brands’ store offering Wi-Fi services, and we may collect the information described above even if you do not actively use your Internet browser or your mobile applications during your time in our store. You can choose to disconnect from the L'Oreal Wi-Fi network at any time through your device’s Wi-Fi settings. However, please note that disconnecting from one store’s Wi-Fi network will only disconnect you from that network during your current visit. You can opt out of the auto-reconnect feature at any time by visiting http://www.smart-places.org.
For full details about our in-store Wi-Fi practices, please see our Wi-Fi Terms of Use.

IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
L’Oréal maintains reasonable safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, copying or destruction and when transferring information for processing and requires third parties providing services on our behalf to do the same.
No method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with L’Oréal websites. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem in order for L’Oréal to resolve the issue in a timely manner. Also keep in mind that e-mail is not a secure form of communication so never send sensitive personal information to us via e-mail.
