What Information Do We Collect?
Information That You Give Us: We collect Personal Data such as your name, date of birth, e-mail or mailing address from you when you voluntarily choose to register for or use certain BD Services at this Site. We use the Personal Data that we collect in an effort to provide you with a superior customer experience on the Site and to improve and market BD Services. BD may store such Personal Data itself or it may be stored in databases owned and maintained by BD's affiliates, agents or service providers. BD retains its rights to these databases and the information contained in them.
If you register with BD or use certain other of the personalized options we offer, we will create a profile that includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other information that you provide that is pertinent to your specific situation. We may combine such information with data gathered from other sources. For instance, if incorrect postal codes are received, we may use third party software to correct them. We also may collect e-mail or other addresses from prospect lists of other companies, for example, in connection with a joint marketing effort. When we do so, (1) we acknowledge in our correspondence how the recipient was added to our list and (2) we provide a means for recipients to opt out of further communications from us. In addition we may ask you for Personal Data if you enter an educational program, contest or promotion sponsored by BD. When you contact BD we may keep a record of that correspondence and may occasionally ask you to complete surveys for sales and research purposes.
In some instances we contract with outside parties to collect and maintain our information collection servers and to perform technology and related services. We seek to provide any such third parties with only the information they need to perform their specific function and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent. Wherever BD collects Personal Data we will provide a link to this Privacy Statement and Consent.

By voluntarily providing us with your Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent.

What are Your Choices?
You can use this Site without providing your Personal Data, although doing so may limit your ability to obtain certain information or to use other valuable BD Services, including, for example, informational newsletters and responses to specific inquiries you may have. Where no Personal Data is legally required or is necessary for a particular service (for example, to contact you in response to your request), the use of a pseudonym is accepted.
We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements. We will take reasonable steps to update, correct or, upon your request, delete your Personal Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via this Site. In order to request an update, with respect to your Personal Data, please contact us as provided below. If at any time you wish not to receive further communications, you may also follow the unsubscribe procedure included in our communication.
Access. BD permits a reasonable right of access and review of Personal Data held by BD by the individual to whom the Personal Data relates; however, to guard against fraudulent requests for access, BD will require information which it determines is sufficient to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections. BD will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and may charge an appropriate cost (e.g. photocopying, mail charges) to the individual making the request. BD reserves the right not to change any Personal Data but will append alternative text the individual concerned believes is appropriate.
In addition, in certain circumstances, BD may decline to provide access to Personal Data, including where BD determines that the information requested:
May disclose:
The Personal Data of another individual or of a deceased individual; or
Trade secrets or other business confidential information;
Is subject to attorney-client or litigation privilege or a professional privilege or obligation;
Is not readily retrievable and the burden or cost of providing would be disproportionate to the nature or value of the information;
Does not exist, is not held, or cannot be found by BD;
Could reasonably result in serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned, serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual, or serious bodily harm to another individual; or
May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities or other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by statute to perform such functions.
Please note that although after receiving a request to update, correct or delete information, we will make reasonable efforts to effect such a change promptly, it is not always possible to complete the process before another communication is distributed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Even if you have requested removal of your Personal Data from our lists, BD reserves the right to retain it in our files in some limited circumstances such as when such Personal Data may be necessary to honor your request to opt out of further communications, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or as provided in our Terms and Conditions. If BD is required to retain any portion of the Personal Data for such purposes, BD shall use reasonable efforts to limit such Personal Data to what is necessary to accomplish the particular purpose. Further, you acknowledge that due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems, Personal Data may continue to reside in our systems even after deletion. Therefore, you should not expect that your Personal Data will be completely removed from our systems in response to your request.
BD will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.

BD uses the Personal Data you provide for our business purposes in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and Consent.
If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, that Personal Data will be available to us for use in connection with the reason for which it was provided or for a consistent purpose, including, if applicable, processing an order placed by you or informing you that the product is no longer available. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Data you provide to respond to you; or if you contact us about a job listing, the information you provide to us may be used to consider you for the position. We may also combine Personal Data that you have provided to us with information obtained by us from other parties.
BD and its affiliates also may use your Personal Data, User Data and other information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, to improve our products and services and to effect and facilitate sales.

Do We Share the Information that We Receive?
BD considers your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. BD will share information including Personal Data with its subsidiaries and affiliates that have also agreed to be bound by this Privacy Statement and Consent. In addition, BD, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we retain another non-affiliated company to perform a function of this nature, we seek to provide them with only the information that they need to perform their specific functions, and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent and BD's restrictions.
In addition, if you input Personal Data on a co-branded registration page, relating, for example, to a contest co-sponsored by both BD and a partner company, then your Personal Data will be available both to BD and to such partner company. While BD will only use such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent, such partner company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and BD cannot be responsible for their use of your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of such partner company before providing information on any such co-sponsored page or promotion.
There are also a limited number of circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and other information in our possession with certain additional third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

Business Transfers, Combinations and Related Activities: As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses or assets.

BD is the parent company of a large international group of companies. In light of this fact, we may, from time to time transfer your Personal Data to one of our databases in another country as provided above under the heading Transfer of Your Data Abroad.
