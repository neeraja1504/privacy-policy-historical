We take your privacy seriously and believe that you should know what information we collect from you and how we use, disclose, and protect that information.
Please read the following to learn how this Privacy Policy applies to your access or use of our websites (including if you are using our website to partner with BBTV as a Content Provider ), mobile applications, and any product or platform we offer or through which we provide services.
2. Collection and processing of your data
Visitors to our websites:
Standard website traffic data. When you visit our websites or otherwise use our services, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, carrier network and hardware settings), information about your physical location (such as GPS signals, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers), and information about your usage of an interaction with our services (including error reports, statistics on page views, and traffic to and from our websites). This data allows us to provide you with a better user experience on our websites. For example, if you are accessing our websites from a non-English-speaking country, this data allows us to provide you with a localized and translated version of our websites.
Cookies. We use “cookies” to enhance your use of our websites or other services. A “cookie” is a small amount of data, which include a unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Every device that accesses our websites is assigned a different cookie by us. Providing us with your information is always your choice. However, we may not be able to provide you with all the services or functionality you require on a BBTV website if you choose to disable cookies.
Usage analytics. Our websites make use of industry-standard analytics frameworks, which track viewership and usage of our websites. Although these frameworks may receive your IP address, they do not provide any personal data to BBTV and are solely for the purposes of improving our websites.
Creators partnered with BBTV:
Personal data required to execute a Content Provider Agreement. If you are a contracted creator with BBTV (also known as Content Providers or partners), or if you have applied to join our network, we collect additional personal data from you that is directly associated with you or that can be used to identify you. This personal data includes your contact information, such as your name, user name, address, phone number, and email. We require this data to issue an agreement to you, to meet legal and regulatory requirements, to provide you with important communications, and to verify your identity in the future should you need to contact us.
Payment information. We also collect your payment method of choice. We use PayPal and other payment information you provide to us in order to provide you with payment for any services that you may provide to us in accordance with an applicable services agreement between you and BBTV.
Date of birth. Before permitting you to use any of our services, we also ask you to provide additional personal data we can use to verify your identity or manage risk, such as your date of birth.
BBTV’s services are not intended for users under the age of 13. We take children’s privacy seriously, and encourage parents to be aware and involved in the online activities of their children at all times to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission. We do not knowingly collect the personal data of minors without parental consent.
Correspondence. We keep records of correspondence with our contracted Content Providers. Correspondence with BBTV is conducted through ticketing systems, email, or online chat mechanisms. We record this information to ensure adequate levels of service are being provided per your agreement with BBTV.
Content performance data. When you partner with BBTV, your platform will begin providing us with performance data about your channel and videos. This includes revenue and viewership data. This data is required to calculate payment to you as per your agreement with BBTV.
If you are a member of a jointly-operated network (such as NBA Playmakers), we share this performance data with the joint operator as well (such as the NBA).
Content metadata, thumbnails, and in-video content. We collect video content and metadata that you post to your channel. This includes metadata uploaded alongside the video, and content from the video itself. This data is required to evaluate your channel for brand safety, compliance with the platform's terms of service, and compliance with your BBTV partnership agreement. BBTV may also use this data to analyze the size and performance of its network.
Creators represented by BBTV in additional revenue opportunities:
Creator profile data. To effectively represent you in additional revenue opportunities (such as branded entertainment opportunities and mobile apps), BBTV creates and shares promotional materials about your channel with third parties who may be interested in working with you. This requires collection of data about your channel, such as the reach of your viewership, demographics of your audience, and a brief profile about you and your channel.
This information is collected from a variety of sources, including third-party analytics tools and information you have shared with BBTV.
Content performance data. If we execute an additional revenue opportunity between yourself and a third party, we will share performance data with that party. The performance data we share will only be related to the opportunity in question.
Content metadata, thumbnails, and in-video content. We review your publicly posted videos and metadata to determine your suitability for additional revenue opportunities. Examples of these opportunities include branded entertainment, advertising campaigns, merchandising, and inclusion in mobile apps. We also use this data to ensure compliance with both the platform's terms of service and your BBTV agreement.
Creators not contracted with BBTV:
Public channel or video content and metadata. If you make public your channel and content on digital platforms, we scan and catalog the metadata you have posted publicly. This is similar to how search engines index your content. Should you be in consideration for a partnership opportunity with BBTV, this data will be reviewed to ensure brand safety, compliance with platform policies, and compliance with BBTV partnership policies.

However, with respect to unaffiliated third parties, we do not share personal data with such parties except as permitted or required by applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Privacy Policy. We share your personal data with unaffiliated third parties in the following circumstances:
If you consent to such disclosure. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal data, such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality, or banking or other sensitive financial information.
To effect, administer, service, process or enforce a service that you request or authorize.

To enable value-add services, we may share data with the third-party service provider so they can verify your partnership with BBTV.
To enable you to join our jointly-operated networks (such as NBA Playmakers), we may share your channel information and performance data with that joint operator (such as the NBA).
To enable advertisers, brands and other third parties to determine whether your channel or videos meet their brand-safety requirements, we may share the information we collect about your channel and videos and the results of our trust and safety reviews (whether automated or manual) with those third parties.
To protect the confidentiality or security of BBTV, our records or our users.

We also share your personal data with unaffiliated third parties that we have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of certain aspects of BBTV’s services, such as payment processing, data management, and analytics. These service provider companies are provided only the information necessary to perform the services. In addition, we require them to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and our security practices.
We share aggregated information that is not personally identifiable (that is, information that cannot, by itself, be used to identify a particular individual or user) with our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, and/or partners, such as advertising and marketing partners. For example, we may share such information to show trends about the general use of our services, to improve the design and content of such third parties’ respective offerings, to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements, to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, and to perform analytics.
If BBTV is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, asset sale, or other similar transaction or proceeding, we will continue to ensure confidentiality of any personal data and will give affected users notice before personal data is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
4. Protection of the data that we collect
We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information that we collect from unauthorized access. We use industry accepted procedures and systems to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the services. These vendors have been selected for their high standards of both physical and technological security, including ISO and SSAE16 certifications, as well as satisfying EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the US. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal data. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.
If you are logged-in, it is advisable that you log out of your account at the end of every session and not leave a logged-in account unattended for any period of time, particularly if you use a shared computer or device.
Unless it is otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we restrict access to your personal data to those BBTV employees, agents and contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, or to provide services to you or otherwise assist you, and that are legally bound to maintain the confidentiality of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We maintain your personal data so that it is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. We encourage you to contact us at privacy@bbtv.com in order help us keep our information current.

7. Data protection for children and minors
BBTV takes children's privacy very seriously and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
BBTV does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children under the age of 13. BBTV does not knowingly enter into contracts with children under the age of 13. In the event that BBTV has verified that a child under 13 has misrepresented his/her age in a BBTV agreement, BBTV will take immediate steps to either terminate that agreement or obtain the necessary consent from the child’s parent or legal guardian.
Minors who are 13 or older, but under 19 or their country's age limit, may only enter into an agreement with BBTV if it is consented to, and co-signed by, his/her parent or legal guardian. We only collect the minimum personal data required to execute the agreement, and only with the consent of the parent or legal guardian.
Parents or legal guardians may request that BBTV disclose, update, delete, or restrict processing of data collected on their children. These requests can be made by emailing privacy@bbtv.com.
You can learn more about the online protections afforded to children from the FTC's COPPA FAQ.
