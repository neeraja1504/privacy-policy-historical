Privacy Policy - Brooklyn Botanic Garden
Commitment to Your Privacy and Security
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site. Personal information includes your name, street, and email addresses, billing information, click-through activity, and any other information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. By using the Brooklyn Botanic Garden website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Information BBG Gathers and Tracks
Third Party Providers
BBG uses reputable third-party providers, including AdRoll and Google Analytics among others, to aid in managing the website, improving our marketing, and creating a better user experience for our visitors.
AdRoll
BBG works with AdRoll retargeting, who uses technology including web beacons and cookies to collect data about our website usage and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. Data recorded through the use of this technology is aggregated and shared with us.
No personally identifiable information about you is collected or shared by AdRoll with BBG. You can opt-out of AdRoll and their partners by visiting the AdRoll website.
Google Analytics
BBG uses Google Analytics to collect website traffic data via cookies and identifiers. Learn more about how Google collects and uses this data. Google Analytics Advertising features, which collect user demographics and interests, are enabled on our website to allow BBG to better understand our users and improve our website.
BBG does not identify individual users or facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through Google Analytics. You may prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Contact Information for Email Newsletters
Brooklyn Botanic Garden offers visitors the opportunity to subscribe to one or more online newsletters. These newsletters are hosted by a third-party provider. Users may remove themselves from these mailing lists by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. The information collected here is used solely for the purpose of the newsletters. BBG does not sell, rent, or otherwise exploit in any way the email addresses of subscribers.
Data for Online Membership Purchases and Donations
Brooklyn Botanic Garden processes online membership purchases, membership renewals, and donations using technology provided by Blackbaud, Inc. The latest encryption technologies are employed, and Blackbaud will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal your personal information to any entity other than BBG.
BBG occasionally shares its mailing addresses with like-minded nonprofit organizations. BBG does not share phone numbers, fax numbers, or email addresses. In accordance with standard practices in the nonprofit world, any list that BBG shares with other organizations is done on a one-time basis only. In other words, an organization to which we provide your address for a mailing will have the use of it only for that mailing and will not be authorized to keep your address, nor provide it to third parties unless you subsequently establish contact with that organization. The same organization might, at BBG's discretion, share portions of our list at a future time but would not have access to your name or address during any point in between.
If you do not want your information shared, there are several ways to let us know. All BBG membership forms—for both renewals and first-time members—state, "If you do not want us to share your address, check here" and have a checkbox. Simply check the box and your information will never be shared. You may also email membership@bbg.org or call the Membership Department at 718-623-7210 to place yourself on the "no-share" list.
BBG Membership Emails
Periodically, BBG's Membership Department sends out information regarding membership renewals, benefits, public events, and important Garden news or information. Members' email addresses are collected through forms that are filled out by the members. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the instructions at the bottom of every email dispatch.
Children
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.
Revisions to Our Privacy Policy
Please note that BBG may revise its privacy policy at any time. Such revisions may arise in response to changes in the law, policy, our site, or other factors. We encourage you to periodically visit this page to review our most current policy.
Contact BBG
If you have any further questions or concerns about BBG's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to the Website Manager.
