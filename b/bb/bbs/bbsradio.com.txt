Newsletters:
BBS Radio Newsletters are intended to keep users informed of new features that are available on our website. They are also used to send out information that we feel our users would appreciate. Our policy is to send our email announcements or newsletters only to those specific individuals that signed up for them. If you receive an email and want to be removed from the newsletter, we provide instructions on how to unsubscribe, so that you will not receive any other messages from BBS Radio in the future.

Disclosure to Authorities:
BBS Radio cannot guarantee that all private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, and may be forced to disclose any and all information to government bodies or government officials or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Accordingly, you authorize BBS Radio to disclose any and all information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
You authorize BBS Radio to disclose your password, name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, gray market, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. Specifically, this includes exchanging such information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. BBS Radio cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a Web server to your computer. To better serve you, we use "cookies" to reduce the time required to submit purchase requests.

Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can only be accessed when you enter your name and password. We do not use the cookie to track your Internet activity once you leave BBS Radio.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but usually, you can change the configuration of your browser to prevent this from occurring. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of BBS Radio's site.
