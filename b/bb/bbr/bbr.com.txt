What personal data do we hold and why?
When you contact us to make an enquiry, we will use your name and contact information to respond. We will then use this information to communicate with you during the provision of our services to you. We collect and update information about users of our services. We may obtain this information via direct contact with you, from third parties such as other users who refer you to us or automatically via your use of our services.
This information may include your contact details, registration and payment details, support problems, details around participation in events, prize draws or surveys and certain relevant details of your product preferences and contact permissions.
For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognises the user’s domain name. We also collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email and anonymously aggregate information on which pages users access or visit. Information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is also collected. We will only use information collected in a survey on an anonymous basis unless we have your permission to do otherwise.
If you are a registered user of our services, we will gather further relevant information, such as generic types of data accessed, time of access, volume of use of services and traffic data from use of our website. Traffic data includes logs, details of networks, data and systems accessed, details of the sender and recipients of messages sent over our services, times and location of log on or access, duration of sessions, clickstream and similar usage or system data. Traffic data may sometimes be traceable to and or related to not just companies but named individuals. Before you register with Berry Bros. & Rudd for access to services or transactional areas of our website, you can browse our website anonymously and we will not collect your data.
We may also receive your personal data when processing gift requests from customers where you are the recipient. We process that data initially under contract with the gift purchaser and any secondary processing such as product updates and associated events will be because we have a legitimate business interest to do so.
On request, we can provide you with access to all information, including proprietary information, that we maintain about you (but not other users unless required to do so by law) including unique identifier information (for example, your customer number or password) and contact information (for example, your name, address and phone number). You can request this information by emailing us atprivacy@bbr.com  or writing to us. We will correct inaccuracies on provision of the correct details or, where relevant, you can do this by changing your registered details online. Please note, we will never send personal information on request unless we have proof that the recipient is the owner of the data.
How do we use your information?
Berry Bros. & Rudd collects and uses your information to administer, support, improve and obtain feedback on our services and to detect and prevent faults, breaches of our network security, the law or our contract terms. If you are registered to use a service, we may use the information you provide to us to carry out the service; we may also contact you to obtain feedback on that service and any improvements we could make to it.
The information we collect is used for internal review and to improve the content of our website and services. It is also used to notify users about updates to our services. This information is not shared with other organisations for commercial purposes.
If you do not want to receive emails from us in the future, please let us know by sending an email to privacy@bbr.com or by logging into your account and changing your contact permission preferences.
Who do we share your information with?
We work with third parties in the provision of some of our services, for example research agencies to help us improve our customer service, or marketing service providers who help us contact our customers and logistics partners who help deliver products.
On request, and when relevant to a service you use, we can provide details of which third parties we work with. We will also discuss and agree on any specific security questions or requirements you may have during the provision of our services.
The third parties we work with – including those who provide email and storage solutions used in our day to day work – are monitored on how they meet the requirements of current UK data protection legislation and the requirements of GDPR. When we contract with third parties we enter into agreements that encourage GDPR compliance.
Where this includes storage or processing of information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we include checks to ensure that compliance with the appropriate frameworks for exchange of personal data (such as the EU-US Privacy Shield) is in place. As a UK-based company our lead data protection supervisory authority is the ICO and GDPR is the standard for our data protection in all territories where data is processed.
We do not share nor sell your personal data to anyone else.
Exemptions to the above are where we are asked to provide information as a result of a court order or to recover monies due.
How long do we store your data for?
We will store your personal information (name, address, email, etc) for a minimum of six years after your last transaction with us. We will keep records of transactions for longer periods, but we will ensure that the data is anonymised so that personal data is deleted after six years.
If you wish to stop hearing from us prior to that time then email us at privacy@bbr.com  and we will remove you from our mailing lists, even though we will retain some historical purchasing records as legally required. If you are a sole trader or partnership, financial transactions between us might include some personal data. We are required by law to keep this information for the current financial year plus an additional six years.
Why do we need to store your data?
This is a legal obligation, because HMRC requires wine and spirit businesses such as ours to keep all business records concerning excise goods for at least six years. HMRC will occasionally carry out inspections of our business and the records we are required to keep for those purposes include, among other things, stock, purchases, sales and dispatches.
We may also store your information on our databases for reference and to record any preferences you have notified to us, for example in relation to your marketing communications contact permissions. The information may be retained and used by Berry Bros. & Rudd to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services, to respect your rights under GDPR, for analysis purposes and for any data retention requirements of the law. This means we may retain information after you cease to use our services or after you have ceased interacting with Berry Bros. & Rudd.
We store your information securely to prevent unauthorised use. See our Security section below.
Does Berry Bros. & Rudd record telephone calls?
Berry Bros. & Rudd may record incoming and outgoing telephone calls. We do this in order to resolve customer queries, monitor quality, and provide training to our staff. We retain call recordings for no longer than 18 months.

Interception of email
Berry Bros. & Rudd may intercept email addressed to individuals within Berry Bros. & Rudd. The reasons we do this are related to the security of your data, to our security, to the security of our staff and others, for detection and prevention of crime and to identify correct recipients or to make sure mail is dealt with during staff absence. Berry Bros. & Rudd may reject, delay or remove content from emails which have a nature, content or attachments which may disrupt our systems or because they may pose security issues such as viruses.
We may also filter out emails which contain content which is considered offensive, unwanted or spam. In certain circumstances this may unfortunately result in “innocent” emails being affected. We do our best to reduce such occurrences.
Security
Berry Bros. & Rudd has developed and implemented strict policies and processes governing information technology and data user behaviour. These cover areas such as access control, authentication, audit, monitoring, alarms, data storage and back up, transmission standards and environment integrity.
We use reasonable endeavours to install and have appropriate security measures in place in our systems and facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you.
We do not store any credit card details on our website. The card details are encrypted and securely held by WorldPay.
We minimise the personal data that is accessible to our colleagues, and where appropriate we anonymise that data for marketing purposes.
When we introduce new systems and policies that relate to personal data, we ensure that data protection and security is included in the design of those systems.
What if this privacy notice changes?
If changes to the Berry Bros. & Rudd Data Protection Policy (and hence this Privacy Policy) include any significantly different use of your personal data, we will let you know and give you the option to agree to the new use.
Questions
The law allows you to request to see any information held about you, and to correct any inaccuracies. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or the use of data in a particular service, please write to Janet Impey, Company Secretary, at 3 St James’s Street, London, SW1A 1EG, or email privacy@bbr.com.
