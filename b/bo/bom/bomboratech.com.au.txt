Privacy Act 1988
The Privacy Act 1988 (the Act ), regulates the way in which many private sector organisations in Australia collect, use, store and disclose personal information.
Personal information is defined under the Act as:
“…information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.”
The Act aims to give people greater control over the way information about them is handled, by requiring organisations to comply with thirteen Australian Privacy Principles or to establish an approved privacy code.
The Australian Privacy Principles cover areas such as collection, use and disclosure of personal information, data quality and security and access and correction rights for individuals.
How we collect personal information
We generally collect personal information directly from the relevant individual but in some cases we may collect it indirectly from a third party, for example from domain name Registrars to whom you have given registration information. There may be other circumstances in which we may collect personal information about an individual, such as the operation of our website www.bomboratech.com.
Information about individuals
Personal information collected by us generally comprises name, address, date of birth, gender and contact details (including telephone, facsimile and e-mail). Personal information is only accessible by authorised Bombora Technologies personnel or authorised service providers who use the information accurately to administer the business of Bombora Technologies or to provide you with our products and services.
Why do we need your personal information?
The personal information that we collect is used by us to conduct our business and is also used in conjunction with the provision of goods and services to you by Bombora Technologies.
Personal information may also be used in connection with:
administering our customer relationships;
monitoring and evaluating products and services;
assisting customers with queries;
taking measures to detect and prevent fraudulent conduct; and
performing and responding to obligations that we have to regulatory or governmental authorities, for example displaying WHOIS information.
Third party service providers
There are other organisations that are connected to the services we provide to you and which may have access to your personal information. They include:
Auditors and Legal Advisers – organisations that ensure we are complying with legislation and contractual obligations.
Insurance companies – organisations which provide insurance cover for our assets.
IT service providers – organisations maintaining our information technology systems and providing information technology services.
We will only disclose personal information to these organisations to enable them to undertake specified management and administration services. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purposes.
Transfer outside of Australia
Our holding, use and disclosure of your personal information may involve transfer of the personal information to countries outside Australia. Where your personal information is transferred outside Australia, we will do so in accordance with Australian Privacy Principle 8, including taking reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.
Legal disclosure requirements
We will also disclose personal information in circumstances where we are required by law to do so. This includes disclosure to certain courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities as authorised or required by law.
Other people authorised by you
Where a person authorises another party to receive information and/or undertake transactions, the authorising person must notify us in writing.
Use of general statistical information
From time to time we may use general statistical information for future planning so that we can improve our business. If you do not consent to us doing so, please let us know.
Unsolicited Information
Where we receive personal information about you that is unsolicited, if it is not reasonably necessary for one or more of the uses set out herein, we shall de-identify or destroy it as soon as practicable.
Direct communication
We may send relevant communication material to you from time to time, such as direct communications (which may include information from third parties) about special offers and promotions that are available for you, where you have given express or implied consent to be included in our mailing list.
If you do not want us to use your personal information to send you direct marketing material, or, if not disclosed by you, you would like to know the source of the personal information we hold, then please phone +61 3 98663710. In the case of e-mail communications, you may also use the “unsubscribe” facility contained in our e-mails.

How we manage your personal information?
We take reasonable steps to keep any personal information which we hold about you secure, to avoid interference, and to keep that information accurate and up to date.
Internally we have controls and procedures to ensure that personal information provided to us remains confidential. All our staff are bound by strict rules and duties of confidentiality.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, however, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information transmitted to or from our website, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third party that may receive such personal information.
Can you see the personal information we have about you?
You have a right to know what information we hold about you, and you can contact us and ask us to show you this information to ensure it is correct. Please note that information that we hold about you may be subject to the requirements of various regulatory or governmental authorities. In that regard, we will comply with the requirements of those regulatory or governmental authorities in releasing any information to you.
We will take all steps reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate, up to date and complete. However, if you would like to make any corrections to your personal information you can contact us in writing at the address designated in this document.
Under the Australian Privacy Principles there are limited circumstances in which access to some or all of this information may be denied. If this applies to you, we will explain this to you when you ask for your information. Otherwise we will endeavour to provide you with your information within a period of 30 days, depending on the amount of information required.
