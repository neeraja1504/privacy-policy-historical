Information Gathered
Registration and Billing Information: When a visitor to an Arena Site registers to become a user of the Services or requests more information about the Services, we require that the visitor provide contact information such as their name, email address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We may also ask visitors, users, or prospective users of the Services for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. Personal information that can identify an individual person is " PII."
Users and visitors can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. However, failure to provide certain requested information may impact a user’s or a visitor’s ability to access the Arena Sites and Services.
Log Data and Activity Tracking: As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, including PII. We combine this information to improve the services we offer you, as well as for marketing, analytics, and site operations purposes.
Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Arena Solutions and our partners, such as our marketing analytics providers and our online chat provider. These technologies are used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the Arena Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We and our partners create individual and aggregated reports using these technologies.
Arena Solutions uses cookies for user analytics and to save a user’s preferences from one session to the next. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Arena Sites and Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Arena Sites and Services may be limited.
Arena Solutions and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Arena Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use link state objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here.
Invite a Third Party: If a user elects to invite a third party to review and provide input on data it has entered as part of the Services, then the user will need to provide the name and email address of each such third party. Arena Solutions will automatically send the third party an email inviting him or her to become a user in order to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data. Though we retain this information to determine whether a user accepts the invitation, we will not otherwise use this information unless and until the third party signs up to become a user of the Services.
Information Use
Arena Solutions uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for users and to improve the Arena Sites.

All financial and billing information collected through the Arena Sites is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for the Services.
