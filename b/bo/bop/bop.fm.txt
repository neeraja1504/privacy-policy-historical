bop.fm does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to marketers. We may use your personal information to contact you from time to time regarding updates to our policies, upgrades to our software, or other information that we feel may be of interest to you.
bop.fm has publicly available profiles where you may share music you love using various social media and other channels. This publicly available profile requires a valid email address and/or social media account access authorizations.
Although we do not sell, trade or rent your information, we may release personal and/or non-personal information about you when you request us to do so. In addition, your information may also be accessed by bop.fm employees as necessary to provide customer support and troubleshoot problems.
We may also release personal and non-personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements, or to protect the rights of bop.fm or others. Information collected about you is protected in several ways. Access by you to your personal information if you sign up for an account is available through a password and unique user ID. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone and change it often.
Your personal information resides on proprietary and secure servers on Amazon Web Services. Only selected bop.fm personnel and contracts have access to it via password. The Amazon Web Services facilities are subject to the terms and conditions of Amazon's Web Services Licensing Agreement.
