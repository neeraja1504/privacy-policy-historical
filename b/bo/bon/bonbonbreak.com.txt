We generally ask you for your email address and/or home number (to notify you if you win, or not).

By providing us with your data, you consent to transfer of such data.
6. Security. BonBon Break is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. Our internal data security policies restrict access to your Personal Information to authorized employees and contractors (“ Authorized Personnel ”). Authorized Personnel may use our users’ Personal Information for BonBon Break business purposes only and are bound by BonBon Break policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our users’ Personal Information.
You should know that BonBon Break cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information and mistakes may happen. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
7. Dispute Resolution. BonBon Break takes its users’ privacy concerns seriously. If you believe that BonBon Break has not adhered to the Privacy Statement, please contact BonBon Break by e-mail at val@bonbonbreak.com. In your email, please describe in as much detail as possible the ways in which you believe that the Privacy Statement has not been complied with. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation. If you and BonBon Break are unable to reach a resolution to the dispute, BonBon Break will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules, which are accessible on the JAMS website at www.jamsadr.com/rules-international-rules. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS International Mediation Rules. The mediator may propose any appropriate remedy, such as publicity for findings of non-compliance, payment of compensation for losses incurred as a result of non-compliance, or cessation of processing of the Personal Information of the individual who has brought the complaint. BonBon Break will assume the costs of the administrative fees if the mediator makes a written recommendation that finds BonBon Break in breach of its duties pursuant to the Safe Harbor. The mediator or the individual may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Safe Harbor enforcement jurisdiction over BonBon Break.
BonBon Break conducts periodic self-assessments to verify that the attestations and assertions it makes about its privacy practices are true and that such privacy practices have been implemented as presented. BonBon Break will take steps to remedy any problems arising out of failure to comply with the Safe Harbor principles.
8.  Review of Anonymous Data from Google Analytics
We are committed to ensuring that our website contains content that is valuable and useful to our readers. To help us with this we have implemented the Google analytics demographics and interest reporting features on our website. These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of website visitors and adapt our website content to better reflect their needs. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using the Google Ad settings or through the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
