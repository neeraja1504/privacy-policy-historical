When you shop with us online you have the option to checkout without creating an online account. The information you provide when you purchase products using the guest checkout, including your name, address and contact details, will be used for the purpose of fulfilling your order and to keep you informed on the status of your order. We will also use your information along with your order information for analytical purposes to help us improve our products, services and shopping experience.

After this time we will anonymise your personal data, except where you have consented to receive marketing from us.
Automated decision-making and profiling
When you make purchases using your Bonus Club card or account, browse our website, respond to marketing communications or join and make purchases using Bonus Club, we will use data we collect from you to analyse and profile the way you shop with us. We use software and automated processing technology to carry out the analysis and profiling. For example, when we select customers to send our mailings and emails to we will use automated decision-making and profiling to ensure we send targeted and relevant communications.
Additionally, we use the data to understand our customer base more fully. We look at attributes such as spend, length of time as a customer, age, frequency and recency of purchases amongst others. It will also be used to help us develop and create products and services for you in the future.
The results of this analysis, together with other demographic data, allows us to ensure that we contact you about products, services and promotional offers that are personalised and tailored to you where you have given us permission to send you such promotional offers.
It may also be used to protect you by detecting and preventing fraud, for example when you shop online, we limit the number of orders you are able to place in a week to ensure that your account or payment details are not being used fraudulently.
Marketing & market research
We or third parties may contact you, where you have given us consent, to participate in market research. We carry out market research to understand your experiences and improve the products and services we offer to you.
Basis for using your information

In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (for example, where you buy products from us online, via our contact centre, or when you place an order in-store), we will need to collect, process and share (as further detailed below) your personal data. Failure to provide the requisite personal data when placing your order and payment information (where appropriate) on entering into the transaction or objecting to this type of processing or exercising your deletion rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our products to you in a number of circumstances (for example, where you buy products from us online, via our contact centre, or when you place an order in-store).
