Website privacy & cookies policy | Bournemouth University
We recognise the importance of your personal privacy. This privacy notice sets out how we use and protect any information that you give us when you use our website. By using our website, you are protected under the relevant data protection and electronic privacy laws.
The Data Protection Legislation (“the DP legislation”) regulates the use of personal data and sets requirements for protecting it. It seeks to balance an individual’s right to privacy with the need of organisations to use information about individuals for legitimate purposes.
The DP Legislation refers to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on 25 May 2018 and additional UK data protection legislation which makes further provision about when and why personal data can be processed and the rights of individuals in relation to their personal data.
The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) sits alongside the DP Legislation and the GDPR. It gives people specific privacy rights in relation to electronic communications. This includes scenarios such as browsing websites which utilise cookies (and similar technologies). Such technologies allow websites to recognise you and store some information about your preferences or past actions. The objective being to make your experience the website more pleasant and usable.
Our approach to data protection compliance is set out in our Data Protection Policy for Staff and BU Representatives (docx 127kb). That Policy contains references to other key BU policies and processes relevant to data protection, including information security policies.
BU’s Data Protection Officer has overall responsibility for managing data protection within BU and communicating with individuals about our data protection compliance. The Data Protection Officer can be contacted on dpo@bournemouth.ac.uk or 01202 962472.
What information do we collect from our website?
Sometimes we need to ask you for information so that you can do things on or through our website – like registering for an event or applying for a course. The information we are likely to collect for these purposes includes your name, address, telephone number and email address, and can even include things like dietary requirements or qualifications.
If we do collect personal data through our website, we will make it clear when are collecting personal information and we will explain what we intend to do with it. We will also refer to the relevant Privacy notices for further information.
We also use Hotjar, third-party software which provides us with:
Heat maps – these are visual representations of how website visitors have interacted with web pages, for example how far down the page they get and what links they interact with. This is aggregated data from thousands of page views, and cannot be used to identify individuals;
Session Recordings – Hotjar records information such as mouse movements and clicks and displays these as session recordings that our web team can watch back. These recordings are anonymous and cannot be linked to any individuals. They’re used to help us better understand what issues our website visitors are facing and what we can do to improve the site experience for them.
Does the website use cookies?

We don't gather any other data that might considered personal data using cookies.
These cookies help us to provide you with a better website, by monitoring which pages you find useful and which pages you don't. In order to-do this we currently rely on your ‘implied’ consent under PECR to-do this. In light of GDPR and a new e-privacy regulation (replacing PECR) we are reviewing our position.

When you use our Course Search facility, we use a cookie that remembers which course you were looking at when you select 'Apply Online'. This then pre-selects that course on the application form to speed things up for you. This cookie expires after three hours. The BU online application system also automatically issues your computer with a cookie which enables the web page to display properly in your browser.
We also use third-party cookies in our email campaigns, mainly sent using an email marketing tool called dotMailer. These are used to monitor how many people open the emails we send and track which links they select within the email. You can find dotMailer's privacy policy on the dotMailer website.
Our website uses Google Analytics Display Advertising Features, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to provide remarketing and other advertising services and features.

These ads may be shown to third party vendors, including Google, on sites across the internet.
The cookies are also used together to report on ad viewings, ad services and related visitor interactions within our website.
