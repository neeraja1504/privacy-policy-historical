This means Collected Data may be stored by Boulesse beyond the time of deletion of your customer account.
4. COOKIES
4.1.   The Boulesse-Webshop uses cookies. Cookies are small data packages, which are automatically transmitted to your web browser and are stored on your device when you visit a website.

6. CUSTOM AUDIENCE
6.1.   Boulesse uses the “Custom Audience”-technology for the Boulesse-Webshop. Custom Audience is a service provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, and Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, respectively (jointly “Facebook“). The Custom Audience technology is used for statistical purposes and for market research and allows Boulesse to realise the purposes indicated in section 5 and in particular to measure and design more effectively its activities on Facebook, e.g. by showing certain posts or advertisements on Facebook only to visitors of the Boulesse-Webshop.
6.2.   In order to use the Custom Audience technology so-called remarketing tags and tracking pixels are integrated in the Boulesse-Webshop. When you visit the Boulesse-Webshop, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Facebook server by way of the remarketing tag. Through this process, Facebook exclusively receives the IP-address of your device and the information that you have visited the Boulesse-Webshop using that IP-address. This way, Facebook can match your visit in the Boulesse-Webshop to your Facebook account and is able to display targeted posts and ads in your Facebook account. In order to use the Custom Audience technology even more efficiently, Boulesse reserves the right to transmit to Facebook your e-mail address and information, which Boulesse has collected by way of cookies. Apart from your IP-address and your e-mail address Facebook receives no Collected Data from Boulesse by way of the Custom Audience-technology. Further information can be found in Facebook’s data policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. If you do not want your data to be collected via Custom Audience and your IP-address or your e-mail-address not transmitted to Facebook, you can deactivate Custom Audiences here.
7. SOCIAL MEDIA-PLUGINS
7.1.   Moreover, the Boulesse-Webshop includes certain features of third party providers (so-called plug-ins) of social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+). These plug-ins enable visitors of the Boulesse-Webshop to share information over social networks.
7.2.   If you click on an icon in the Boulesse-Webshop, which is linked to such a plug-in (e.g. like-button as used on Facebook) the servers of that third party provider, will be contacted automatically. When such contact is established, certain data concerning your visit of the Boulesse-Webshop may be transmitted to the third party provider. If you are at the same time logged on to your user account at that third party provider, your visit to the Boulesse-Webshop may be associated with your user account (e.g. Facebook profile) at that third party provider. Boulesse can neither influence the data transmission nor its content. For the purpose and scope of the collection of data and the processing and other use of data by your social media provider as well as your rights in this respect and your options for the protection of your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of your third party provider.
7.3. Boulesse also uses Tawk.to for its live chat service. Tawk.to offers Boulesse employees an external platform for the management of chats. By using the chat you automatically use the services of Tawk.to and data is transmitted which is used for security and documentation. The collected data includes: chat history, name, contact data, IP address at the time of the chat and country of origin. These data are not passed on to third parties and are used only for customer communication and for internal statistics. By using the chat, you agree to this. Please find additional information from Tawk.to here in their privacy policy.
8. TRANSMISSION OF DATA TO SERVICE AGENTS
8.1.   Beside the transfer of Collected Data within the analytical tools described in the section 6 and 7 Boulesse transmits certain Collected Data to service agents in Austria and abroad, which are instructed by Boulesse with the provision of certain services in connection with the purposes specified in section 5. These service agents include the Boutiques and carriers, which require certain Collected Data (e.g. delivery address) for consignment and transport of the ordered goods to you. Furthermore, also banks and credit card institutions have to receive certain Collected Data for processing payments. By visiting the Boulesse-Webshop, you agree that Boulesse and its service agents process your Collected Data for the purposes specified in section 5.
8.2.   All data providers which are instructed by Boulesse according to section 8.1. undertake towards Boulesse to handle the received Collected Data in accordance with this privacy policy and the relevant data protection laws and to use them exclusively for rendering those services for which they have been instructed by Boulesse.
8.3.   Boulesse also uses additional external service agents to analyse the usage of the Boulesse-Webshop. By visiting the Boulesse-Webshop, you agree that these service agents collect anonymous data of a part of your visiting behaviour during your visit of the Boulesse-Webshop. The data collected in this way will be anonymously transmitted to servers of the service agents abroad, including in the United States. Boulesse only co-operates with service agents, which have contractually undertaken to Boulesse that they will not associate the anonymous usage data (which was collected in the way described above) with any other data which concerns you and which may have been collected on other websites. The identification by these service agents of visitors of the Boulesse-Webshop by their names is therefore excluded contractually and by technical means.
9. TRANSMISSION OF DATA TO AUTHORITIES AND ILLEGAL ACTS
9.1.   Boulesse and the Boutiques may be obliged to transmit certain Collected Data to customs authorities in order to complete customs declarations and other measures and declarations in the connection with the customs clearance of goods ordered by you in the Boulesse-Webshop.
9.2.   Boulesse will process any personal data beyond the scope of the Collected Data provided there is sufficient indication for such processing and as far as such processing is required in a particular case for the investigation and prevention of criminal offences, breach of contract and other illegal acts, in each case involving the Boulesse-Webshop. In order not to interfere with the investigation of such illegal acts, Boulesse will not inform the person whose personal data is processed.
9.3.   Boulesse may also be obliged by judicial or administrative requests in connection with Court or administrative investigations or with other suspicion of criminal or otherwise illegal acts to disclose personal data. Boulesse will comply with such requests provided they are in line with the laws. Again, in order not to interfere with the investigation of such illegal acts Boulesse will not inform the person whose personal data is processed.
10. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
10.1.   This privacy policy is governed by the laws of the Republic of Austria excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
10.2.   This choice of law is subject to mandatory consumer protection laws of the ordinary place of residence of any customer outside Austria, provided such customer has its ordinary place of residence in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA).
10.3.   The relationship between Boulesse and customers who are consumers shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the First District of Vienna. Claims by consumers against Boulesse based on mandatory consumer protection laws of the customer’s ordinary place of residence may be either brought before the Courts of the First District of Vienna or before the Courts of the EU member state where the customer has its ordinary place of residence.
10.4.   The relationship between Boulesse and customers who are entrepreneurs shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of competent Courts in commercial matters of the First District of Vienna. Furthermore, Boulesse is entitled to sue the entrepreneur at its place of general jurisdiction.
11. GENERAL PROVISION
11.1. In this privacy policy all references to individuals are neutral in gender and shall be interpreted equally in the female and male form
11.2. The ineffectiveness or unenforceability of one or more provisions of this privacy policy shall not affect the effectiveness or the enforceability of the other provisions of this privacy policy. Boulesse and the customer undertake to replace any ineffective and unenforceable provision by an effective and enforceable provision which fulfils the economic purpose of the ineffective and unenforceable provision as close as possible and which is effective and enforceable.
