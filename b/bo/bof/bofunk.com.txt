This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intentionally collect any personal information from children under 13, unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Our policy with respect to children under 13 is described below.
Overview
We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your viewing preferences. So, we may ask you to register and provide personal information when you post comments or utilize other areas of our site. However, you always have the right to choose not to register or provide personal information, in which case you may not have access to those areas.
If you choose to register with our site, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, and updated information. Our newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether you opened the e-mail and what links (if any) were clicked. We use that information exclusively to improve your site experience. If you choose to register with our site you may automatically receive e-mails to confirm your registration and to provide you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration. With the exception of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below.
Use of Information
When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique user name selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information.
We may use such personally identifiable information to provide the information or content you have to contact you about programs, products, features or services in which we believe you may be interested (such as future promotional materials), or for other purposes disclosed from time to time. We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Web Site. In addition, we may use information collected to improve the content and navigation of our Web Site, or for other internal purposes.
