If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you may not access or use the Service. Datavalet may modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without your consent or authorization, including modification or termination of the Service, or any components thereof. Datavalet will notify you of any changes to these Terms and Conditions by posting notice of the modified Terms and Conditions on the "Login" or "Intercept" page that is presented to you when you first access the Service from a "Location". You agree to periodically review the then-current Terms and Conditions and/or Privacy Policy in order to be aware of any modifications and your continued use of the Service shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the modified Terms and Conditions and/or Privacy Policy, as applicable. If you do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, you agree that you will be unable to use the Service.

You agree to indemnify and hold Datavalet, its directors, officers, shareholders, affiliates, agents and suppliers harmless from all liabilities and expenses related to any violation of these Terms and Conditions by you or any user of your device, or in connection with your or their use of the Service. While using the Service, you may not post, transmit or otherwise distribute information constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise use the Service in a manner which is contrary to law or to Datavalet's then-current policies or would serve to restrict or inhibit any other user from using or enjoying the Service or the Internet. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to use the Service for any commercial purpose not otherwise permitted by these Terms and Conditions.
4. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
You are responsible for your use of the Services. You shall not use or allow others to use the Service if such use:
is for, or results in, any illegal, abusive, annoying or offensive activities, including making available offensive content, the commission or encouragement of a criminal offence, stalking, harassment, spamming, disrupting or interfering with the Internet, any network, computers, or other devices, transmission of a virus or other harmful component, defamation, intellectual property infringement, or interference with other clients' service;
consumes excessive network capacity in Datavalet's reasonable opinion, or causes its network, or its ability to provide services to others, to be adversely affected;
is for multi-media streaming, continuous data transmission or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, automated machine to machine connections or peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, voice over Internet protocol or any other application that is not made available to you by Datavalet which uses excessive network capacity;
is to provide a substitute or back-up for private lines or dedicated data connections such as DSL
is to operate any server system (including email, web, or other kind of server).
You shall not threaten abuse or harass any Datavalet employee or representative. You shall not (a) commit, attempt to commit, or allow others to commit or attempt to commit, any fraud against Datavalet including fraudulently obtaining Services, or (b) transform outbound communications into incoming communications or otherwise attempt to avoid applicable charges, or (c) otherwise abuse the Service or allow others to do any of the foregoing. You shall not resell, transfer, distribute, share or exploit for commercial purposes any Service. You must follow all other service and security regulations issued or adopted by Datavalet. Datavalet reserves the right to limit or lockout your use should such use be in contravention of these Terms and Conditions. In addition, Datavalet, and the owner or proprietor of the site at which the Services are being offered at your time of access to the Services and/or a Location (collectively, the "Service Provider(s)") each reserve the right to limit or restrict your usage or the speeds at which you receive the Service at their discretion.
5. SERVICE AVAILABILITY
The Service is only available where Location facilities exist. Datavalet assumes no liability whatsoever for any claims, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or otherwise relating to the unavailability of the Service in your geographical area, in particular due to changes in the location and configuration of Locations.
6. PERFORMANCE LEVELS
Datavalet does not guarantee the performance of the Service. You understand that any content that you may access through the Service may be subject to network management in order to ensure that all users of the Services receive reasonable access to the Services.
7. SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Datavalet respects your privacy and protects your private information according to its Privacy Policy available at http://datavalet.com/en/about/terms-use-privacy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Datavalet will not be responsible for any corrupted files or viruses which affect the user of the Service. It is your responsibility to safeguard your system, through appropriate means (e.g. using commercially available software), from theft, unauthorized use or system corruption. Any detriment caused to the network as a result of your failure to properly secure your system may result in the immediate termination of your access to the Service. Datavalet does not ensure or guarantee privacy for users of the Service. Any such use shall be at your sole risk and Datavalet, its affiliates and its agents shall be relieved from all liability in connection therewith. Locations represent additional security risks as compared with wired Internet connection because access to your compatible device is possible without being physically connected to your device, therefore, it is strongly recommended that you (and it is your responsibility to) ensure that the configuration of your device is secure. In order to work with the widest variety of devices, you acknowledge that the Locations do not provide any level of encryption (such as WEP, WPA or other encryption and authentication mechanisms).
8. SERVICE BANDWIDTH RESALE OR REDISTRIBUTION PROHIBITED
Resale or redistribution of bandwidth or any other part of the Service for any purpose is strictly forbidden. Failure to comply with this condition will result in immediate cancellation of access to the Services.

IP addresses may change each time you access at Location, or any time at the discretion of Datavalet without prior notice to you. Datavalet assumes no liability whatsoever for any claims, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or otherwise relating to any change in IP Addressing.
10. USER INFORMATION
Your messages may be the subject of unauthorized third party interception and review. An individual with Internet access can cause damage, incur expenses and enter into contractual obligations while on the Internet. All such matters are your responsibility. Datavalet has no obligation to monitor the Service. However, you agree that Datavalet reserves the right to monitor the Service electronically from time to time and to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any laws, regulations or other governmental request or as necessary to operate the Service or to protect itself or others.
11. NO LIABILITY FOR CONTENT

Datavalet shall have no responsibility to notify any third party providers of services, merchandise or information of such termination or suspension. Any termination of your right to use and/or access the Service and/or these Terms and Conditions shall not relieve you from any liability accruing hereunder prior to the time that such termination becomes effective.

Failure by Datavalet to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any of the provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions are determined to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect the remaining provisions contained herein. Where any provision of these Terms and Conditions conflicts with an applicable tariff, the tariff shall supersede these Terms and Conditions only in respect of the conflicting provision. These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Datavalet may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions to any affiliated entity without your prior written consent. You may not assign or transfer these Terms and Conditions. In no event shall Datavalet be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms and Conditions if such failure results from any condition or event beyond the reasonable control of Datavalet, including, but not limited to, fire, flood, earthquake, any elements of nature or acts of God, theft, riot, strike or other labour disturbance, power failure or war.
