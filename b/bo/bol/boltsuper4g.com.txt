Where you have choices about how we use the information you provide, we’ll tell you so at the point of collection.
Because of the way this website operates, we may also use information from your browser or browsing activities to personalize the site or route you to relevant information. For example, we may use web-log information, cookies or web beacons in ways that help us maintain some of your site preferences, send you to the right country-specific information or understand how our visitors navigate the site so we can make it better. You can choose whether or not to allow cookies or web beacons using your browser preferences.
Sharing information within the BOLT corporate family
Some of the services or information you can request on this site may come from other members of our corporate family. Therefore, we may share your information with other companies within BOLT (for example, your local carrier). The laws of the countries where these companies are based may not be the same as those in the , but your information will be treated with the same high standard of care wherever it’s processed within the corporate family.
