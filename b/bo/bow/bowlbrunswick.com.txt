This Privacy Policy will tell you how and what information we may receive about you, and how we may use your information when providing you our tools, products and services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Please consult our Terms of Use Agreement for additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of and access to the Site.
1. HOW THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES
This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by the Company and the mobile optimized versions of these sites. This Privacy Policy also applies to any other property and application owned or operated by Company (“App”) which links to or references this Privacy Policy. Except where expressly noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to our Web sites also apply to our Apps and such other properties.
Our Web sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware when you visit another Web site (whether through an advertisement, service, link or otherwise), Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites, nor do we endorse, warrant, recommend or guarantee the services offered through such other sites. You should review the privacy statements of those other Web sites.
In connection with the tools, products and services provided through our Web sites, some of the information you provide may constitute Personal Information.  “Personal Information” means non-public information that can identify you individually on a personal basis.  Also, some information we receive through such tools, products and services may be non-Personal Information. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of information you provide to the Company. Inaccurate information may affect the information you receive when using such tools, products and services.
2. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may receive non-Personal Information about you as follows:
Cookies and Web Beacons
We may receive information through the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technology. Cookies are pieces of data that a Web site transfers to a user’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about Web site usage, e-mail response and tracking.
A designated service provider, or third-party advertisers or their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique cookies on your device or use similar electronic tools in order to display advertisements that you see on our Web site. Information about your visits to, and activity on, our Web site, an IP address, as well as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, are used to display on your device screen customized advertisements that may be of particular interest to you. We do not have access to, or control the information collected by, these cookies or similar electronic tools used by these third-party advertisers or their advertising servers. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and advertising servers is not covered by this Privacy Policy. For information about advertising networks and how to “opt out” of cookies placed by the Network Advertising Initiative’s member advertising networks, please contact the third party companies.
Third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies or Web beacons or other storage technologies to collect or receive information on our Web site (and elsewhere on the internet) and use that information to display advertisements or provide measurement services.  You can opt out of such data collection by contacting us.  You can access more information on this topic through various sources, including http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Company’s designated service provider may assist Company with advertisement display functions for our Web sites. For more information about such provider’s handling of non-Personal Information and use practices, including the use of cookies, as well as its instructions on how to “opt out” of having your Web site usage information collected or used by such provider, please contact us. When you opt out via this method, you officially opt out of such provider’s advertisement display programs for your device’s particular Web browser. You need to opt out for each browser, on each device you use to surf the Web. Thus, if you use multiple browsers (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the Web from multiple devices (e.g., work and home), you need to explicitly opt out from each browser on each device.
Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, it is possible that some parts of this Web site, such as the polls, surveys, contests, product sales, and game areas, will not function properly if you disable cookies.
Our Web sites may also use web analytics services provided by service providers (e.g., Google). Such providers may use cookies to help the Website analyze how users use the Web site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Web site (including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by such providers. Such providers may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other services relating to Web site activity and internet usage. Such providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on such provider’s behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser as described above, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Web site.
Third Party Advertisers
As mentioned above, sponsors or advertisers on Company’s Web sites may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the advertisements served on our Web Sites, Apps and in emails, special promotions, newsletters or communication we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than Company to serve their advertisement and to monitor users’ responses to advertisement, and these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also receive non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination. This re-direction process may not be apparent to you.
We do not control third party’s use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-Personal Information they receive. You should not provide Personal Information to such sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers without your consent. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent such third party’s from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site.
Some of the information gathered from the use of cookies, web beacons and similar technology is described below.
Information from Video and Interactions with Web site and Properties
We may receive non-Personal Information about your interactions with video content (if any) on this Web site, such as the type of content viewed and information about your interactions with email messages (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded).  We may also receive non-Personal Information through your interactions with the Web site and our other properties.
Information on Web pages and Links
We may receive non-Personal Information on Web pages and advertisements you view from the Web site and links within the Web site.
URL, Browser Type, Operating Systems and IP Address
Like many other Web sites, we may receive non-Personal Information about our users’ utilization, activity and navigation of our Web site, Web sites of selected sponsors and advertisers, your browser type, IP protocol and operating system.
Apps
When you download and install our Apps onto your device, we may assign a number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this number in a manner similar to our use of cookies as described above. Unlike cookies, the number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use cookies, please do not use the App.
Third Party Sources
We may receive non-Personal Information from other sources, such as through vendors and service providers with authorized rights to such information, and from publicly available sources.
Use of Non-Personal Information
The paragraphs described above outline some of our uses of non-Personal Information.  We may also use non-Personal Information to help us monitor how many people are using our Web site and selected sponsors’ and advertisers’ sites, to provide enhanced functionality on the Web site (e.g., user ID and password prompts, navigation aids, and session timers), to help us generate and deliver advertising, marketing and content on Web pages or any of our other properties, to monitor certain other Web site activity (e.g., user-agent, last URL requested by the user, client-side and server-side clickstream, age restrictions), to monitor how many people open our emails, and for functions related to the foregoing.
We may also use and share non-Personal Information in the same manner as our use of Personal Information described below and in connection with our business (e.g., our third party contractors, agents and representatives may help us utilize cookies and web beacons, and store/handle non-Personal Information).
3. PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may use third party administrators, agents or representatives to assist us in managing such User Forums. You may be given the option to register or create an account for such administrator.
