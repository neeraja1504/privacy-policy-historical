For certain services, we also ask for credit card or other payment account information, which we preserve in encrypted form on our secure servers. We gather this information in order to bill you for your purchase. Your address is also needed to allow us to ship your product to the specified destination. We may merge the information you present under your account with information from other OutdoorNetwork services in order to provide you with an enhanced experience and to advance the worth of our services. When you create an account, you can elect to save your billing information in Your Account . Please know this information can be changed or= deleted except in certain instances when it is required to obtain a specific type of an account.
