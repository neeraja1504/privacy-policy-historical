Boat International Media uses the data we collect to operate our business and provide you with the products and services we offer, which includes using data to improve our products and services and personalise your experiences.
We may also use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product or service information. We may also use the data to help us show you more relevant ads, whether in our own products, or in products offered by third parties.

In carrying out these processes, we combine data that we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalised experience. For example, we may use the yachts you have viewed on the “FOR SALE” section of our website to deliver more relevant yachts for sale listings in our emails to you. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technologies and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations.
