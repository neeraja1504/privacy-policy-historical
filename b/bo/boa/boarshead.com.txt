Frank Brunckhorst Co., LLC (Brunckhorst) has implemented this Privacy Policy governing the personally identifiable information (Personal Consumer Information) collected by this site. This Privacy Policy does not govern Personal Consumer Information collected from any other source or in any other manner.
Overview
This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to:
the type of information that is collected, how it is used, with whom it is shared;
how we intend to protect the information; and
how you can access, modify and/or delete such information.
California Privacy Rights
Under California law, California residents who have provided personal information to a company has the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company has disclosed such information for direct marketing purposes along with a list of the categories of personal information that have been so disclosed only if the company has not adopted and disclosed a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures. Instead, California legal requirements are met if the company provides you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information. Because the Brunckhorst policy as disclosed on this site provides California residents with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures of your Personal Consumer Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes, Brunckhorst is not required to maintain or disclose such lists. If you are a California resident and would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may contact us via postal mail at:
