U.S. Privacy Policy | BOATERexam.com®
Our Privacy Commitment
This version in effect since May 16th, 2007.
At BOATERexam.com® we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to outline our guidelines for the collection and use of personal information.
Who is BOATERexam.com®?
BOATERexam.com® is the operating name of Boater Exam America, Inc., a leading provider of safe boater education across North America. This privacy policy applies to Boater Exam America, Inc. and all of its named operations and divisions.
What Information does BOATERexam.com® Collect and How is it Used?
At BOATERexam.com®, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information.
With your consent we may use your personal information for a number of different purposes, for example to:
fulfill requests for products, services or information;
provide customer services;
administer contests or promotions;
offer new products and services;
measure and improve the effectiveness of our Web Sites or our marketing endeavors; and
tailor our online or on-site offerings to your preferences.
We may also collect and summarize customer information in a format that no longer identifies the individual for statistical purposes.
Personal information typically includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. You can always choose not to provide us with any of your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested.
Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our advertising and promotional efforts.
Your Implied Consent
In some cases, your consent is implied if we ask you to provide personal information with a stated purpose. For example, we can only deliver the product you have purchased if you provide us with your address and phone number.
Your Express Consent
In other cases, we will ask you to give your express consent to use your personal information to advise you of products or services that may be of interest. You always have the opportunity to "opt out" of having your information used for this purpose.
Withdrawing Your Consent
If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example, each e-mail we send you will tell you how to decline further e-mail.
Information BOATERexam.com® Collects from You
Listed here are some examples of the ways that we collect information about you and how we use it.
On-Site Purchases
When you purchase a BOATERexam.com® product or service, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request. Examples where we need contact information include delivery of products, mailing of your Boater Education Card, and rebate requests. If we collect this information, we may also ask for your consent to use this information to send you promotional information on products and services.
Our Web Sites
While using our Web Sites, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information (such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information).
