BOARDHOST PRIVACY POLICY
Boardhost.com, Inc. is a provider of customizable, interactive message boards and forums, which are created and maintained by customers of our service. This document describes our policies regarding privacy, and the privacy expectations that you may have when using our customers' message boards or forums, using this site, or when corresponding with us.
Usage of our services is subject to our Usage Terms and Terms of Service.
It is our intention to not collect any more information than what we believe is necessary to provide our service. We never sell, trade or barter information in our records.
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS (I.E. THOSE WHO CREATE THEIR OWN MESSAGE BOARD OR FORUM)
Information necessary to provide you with services may be shared, such as:
If you make a payment, we need to share your information with our billing providers to process the payment, prevent fraud, or resolve disputes regarding your payment.
We may disclose information in certain circumstances in response to a court order or in response to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative process, or may do so if we believe there has been a violation of law or an emergency necessitating such disclosure.
We do not utilize a promotional mailing list of any kind. We will use your email address only to provide requested assistance or information, to remind you of an upcoming billing renewal, or to provide information that may be required by law, or if we have information that we believe may materially affect your usage of our services. MESSAGE POSTINGS
When you post to a message board or forum, you are sharing your submission publicly; message postings are not private.
Any information revealed in a posting to a message board or forum provided through our service becomes public information. Should you choose to include your email address or other contact information in a posting, you may be subject to unsolicted correspondence from other viewers of your post. Your posting could be indexed by search engines and found in their listings. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.
Many of our customers allow users to post messages without registering. This enhances privacy, but also makes abuse more difficult to prevent. Therefore, after any posting, a truncated version of your IP address (with the last octet dropped for privacy), as well as your user-agent string, which ordinarily includes such information as your computer's operating system and the type and version of your web browser, is available to the owner and/or moderators of the message board or forum you have posted at. This is necessary for the owner to administrate their message board or forum, and to control abuse by permitting them to place IP address bans.
For the limited purpose of abuse prevention, Boardhost may preserve the full IP address and user-agent string information related to any message posting. Boardhost may reveal such information to governmental agencies, courts, or other third-parties if we believe, in our sole discretion that you have or may have committed illegal activities, violated our Usage Terms, violated the rights of third-parties, impaired in any respect the ability of Boardhost to operate our service properly, or endanged in any respect Boardhost or third-parties, or in the event that the information is subpoeaned or subject to other judicial or administrative process. Such records will not be used for any other purpose.
CORRESPONDENCE WITH US
Correspondence received from customers of our service (who identify themselves as such) regarding their account will ordinarily not be revealed to third-parties except as we deem, in our sole discretion, necessary for us to address any issues raised in or by such correspondence, or as required by law.
If you're contacting us about someone else's account, your correspondence may be revealed to that customer, or to other third-parties at our sole discretion (even if the third-party contacting us is also our customer). For instance, if we receive a complaint regarding a customer's account, we may reveal that complaint to the account holder, so that they may address the situation.
