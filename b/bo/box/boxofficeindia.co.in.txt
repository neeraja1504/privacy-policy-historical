Welcome to the website www.boxofficeindia.co.in and online services (the “ Website “) operated by [Box Office India] (“ BOI” ). BOI values the privacy of our members and others who visit and use the Website (individually, “ You ” or collectively, “ Users “). We take your privacy seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable information that we obtain from and about individuals both online and offline.
This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered member), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Service. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.
Collection of Information
User-provided Information : When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to BOI what is generally called “personally identifiable information” (such as your full name, email address, postal mailing address, and/or home/mobile telephone number). You may also be able to add a picture of yourself. If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or integrated service that we may make available (“ Integrated Service” ), such as Facebook or Google, BOI may also collect any such “personally identifiable information” that you have provided to the Integrated Service from the account you have with the Integrated Service. You may revoke BOI’s access to your account on the Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Website. From time to time, BOI may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving BOI the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in with BOI, you are not anonymous to us.
Information from other Users : We may make available certain features on the Website that allow other Users of the Website to provide us information that may include your personally identifiable information.
“Cookies” Information : When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. BOI may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on the Website.

Third Party Web Beacons:  We may also implement third party content, such as advertising, on the Website that uses “clear gifs,” “web beacons,” or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser, or implement similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on the Website. This information is collected directly by the third party, and BOI does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
