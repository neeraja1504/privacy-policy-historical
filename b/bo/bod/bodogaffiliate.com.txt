Betting Partners is dedicated to providing useful, relevant and valuable information to our affiliates. We offer an assortment of ongoing, daily, weekly and monthly publications.

Important messages concerning any temporary site or system outages, plus any maintenance issues that may affect the level of service.

Breaking news and expert analysis of popular games and industry trends.
To ensure the quality of affiliate communications, Betting Partners allows affiliates to view or modify their subscription preferences at any time simply by logging into their account and selecting “Manage Subscriptions” from the “Manage Account” screen.
Affiliates can opt-out of receiving email from Betting Partners. However, there is a minimum level of communication required for affiliates to be part of our program. Everyone with a Betting Partners account receives a “Welcome” email, containing valuable account information.
If at any time an affiliate indicates that he or she no longer wants to receive communications from Betting Partners, or if he or she wishes to change or correct any previously provided information, the affiliate can email outlining the request to support@bettingpartners.com.
Qualified Betting Partners staff has access to account numbers, account holder names, telephone numbers, addresses, and email addresses. Affiliates can change their password directly on the Betting Partners website.
If an affiliate needs to change an address, email and/or telephone number, they should submit changes directly from the Betting Partners website (under “Manage Account/Change Address”). New information is verified with card-issuing banks and updated accordingly. Affiliates must ensure that card-issuing banks have their new address and phone number PRIOR to submitting their profile updates.
Affiliates who lose their account login information may retrieve it via the “Forgot your password?” option found on the “Sign In” screen of the Betting Partners website. All changes made to account holder information, whether done online or by telephone, are logged. It is the policy of Betting Partners not to change an account holder’s name unless we have an official name change notification on file (e.g. marriage certificate, notice of name change).
