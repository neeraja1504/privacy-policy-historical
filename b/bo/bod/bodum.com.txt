Data Privacy Statement
The following statement, together with our Terms and Conditions, and any other documents referred to in them, informs you of the type, scope and purpose of our processing activities with regards to the personal data which we may collect from you or which you provide to us.
1. Responsible office
The office responsible for collecting, processing and using your data is
Bodum AG
Kantonsstr. 100
CH - 6234 Triengen
Register No.: CH-100.3.004.758-3.
2. Collection, processing and use of personal data
2.1 Personal data
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes your name, telephone number, address and all inventory data that you provide to us while registering and creating your customer account.
2.2 Customer account
For each customer who registers an account, we set up password-protected, direct access to that customer’s saved inventory data (customer account). Here you can review data about your completed, open and recently submitted orders and manage your address data and newsletter preferences. You can also send out wish lists through your customer account, and rate products.
2.3 Collection, processing and use of your data
You can visit our website without providing personal information. In this case, we will only collect access data, such as the name of your internet service provider, the page from which you are visiting us, the browser type/version/language, and a few other pieces of technical information or the name of the file you requested. This data is technically required in order for us to provide our offering and is used solely to administer our website.
When you order a product, we will collect, save and process your data for the complete processing and billing of your purchase. For your order, we will need your correct name, address and payment data. We need your email address in order to confirm your order and to communicate with you. We also use it for identification (customer login). In addition, you will receive your order and shipment confirmation through your email address.
With your permission, we will also use your personal information for the purpose of sending out promotional materials for our own products, such as our newsletter, by email and by mail. You can prevent your personal information from being used for promotions by clicking here. Each of our newsletters naturally also includes an unsubscribe link.
Your personal data will only be shared with third parties or otherwise transmitted if this is necessary in order to execute the contract or for billing purposes, or if you agreed to this in advance. During order processing, for instance, the service providers we use here (such as carriers, logistics specialists and banks) receive the data necessary for processing the order and executing the contract. Data shared in this manner may only be used by our service providers to fulfill your assignment. Any other use of the information is not permissible, and does not occur with any of the service providers we hire.
Your personal data will be deleted – as long as statutory storage requirements do not oppose this and if you assert a deletion claim – once the data is no longer required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was stored or if for statutory reasons it is no longer permissible to store the data.

Under no circumstance will Google link your IP address with other data from Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you might not be able to fully use all functions offered by this website.

4. Social Plugins
We use plugins from social networks on our website. You can identify the plugins by the respective network logo. The plugin informs the social network that you called up the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged in to the social network, the network can assign this visit to your account. If you interact with the plugins, for instance by clicking on the Facebook “Like” button or adding a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted by your browser directly to the social network and saved there.
For more on the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by social networks, as well as your rights and setting options in this regard in order to protect your privacy, please see the data privacy notices of the respective networks and/or websites.
If you do not want social networks to gather data about you through our website, you will need to log out of these networks before visiting our site.
Even if you are not logged in to the social networks, websites with social plugins can send data to the networks. Each time the website is called up, a plugin sets a cookie with a code. Since your browser sends this cookie without being requested each time there is a connection to a network server, the network could in theory create a profile of which websites the user assigned to the code has called up. It would then certainly be possible to assign this code back to a person, for instance when the person logs in to the social network later.
If you do not want social networks to gather data about you through plugins, you can select the “Block third-party cookies” feature in your browser settings. The browser will then not send cookies to the server for embedded content from other providers. However, this setting may in some cases also prevent cross-page functions from working in addition to the plugins.
5. Secure data transmission
We securely transmit your personal data using encryption. This applies to your order as well as to the customer login. We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encoding system. While no one can guarantee absolute protection, we use technical and organizational measures to secure our web pages and other systems to prevent the loss, destruction, access, modification or distribution of your data by unauthorized persons.
6. Informational rights of affected parties
Our customers have the right to obtain information about their stored data, as well as the right to correct, block or delete data if applicable.
We take protecting your data very seriously. In order to ensure that personal data is not shared with third parties, please direct any email inquiries to privacy@bodum.com and identify yourself clearly.
7. Changes to this policy
Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
