3.    HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
To Provide Products, Services, and Information.  As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase using the Site, and provide information that you request from us.  We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship products to you.  We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us.
We may use third parties to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. We use demographic information to better understand our customers, and improve our products and services.
Advertising and Marketing. We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for Body Central or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use our own cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by Body Central. You can opt-out of tracking for interest-based ads provided directly by Body Central by clicking here.

For example, we use Criteo to provide online interest-based advertisements on our behalf. Criteo may place anonymous cookies on the browsers of visitors to our Site and may send their own cookies to the visitors’ cookie file. These cookies allow Criteo to display advertisements to visitors. Each advertisement provided by Criteo will include a link to Criteo’s Privacy Policy page that will include information for users on how to opt-out of being re/targeted. For more information about Criteo or to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from Criteo, please visit Criteo’s privacy policy at http://www.criteo.com/us/privacy-policy.

Some third party websites may belong to ad networks that use your browsing history across websites to choose which ads to display on their sites; the displayed ads may include advertising for Body Central. To learn more, and to opt out of seeing interest-based advertisements on these sites, visit the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance websites (www.networkadvertising.org and www.aboutads.info). Websites may also offer their own opt-out methods for interest-based advertising.

Sensitive personal information is a particular category of personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality.

Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.
Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Body Central, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.

In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.
