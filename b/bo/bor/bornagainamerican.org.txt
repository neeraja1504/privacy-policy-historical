IP Addresses and Log File Data:
IP addresses are ID numbers for the location of your computer or network on the internet. Log files are recordings of the traffic to and from a server. Declare Yourself’s servers log IP addresses for systems administration and
troubleshooting. We track page hits in the aggregate to track the
popularity of pages that people visit. With that information we can improve the quality of the site. Declare Yourself does not use these files to collect personally identifying information, and log files and IP addresses are neither stored with nor used in conjunction with personal information.
Children's privacy:
Declare Yourself is concerned about the safety and privacy of children online. Because of this, we will make all efforts to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not and will not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we will develop our site with the capacity to block acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.
It is possible that by fraud or deception by others we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or else delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us at  \n info@declareyourself.com.
