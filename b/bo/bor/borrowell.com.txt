Privacy Policy | Borrowell
Privacy Policy
Borrowell is committed to the protection of personal information. As part of this commitment, we have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe the manner in which Borrowell Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively, “Borrowell”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage information about you (“Personal Information”) in connection with your access to and use of our Services (as defined in our Terms of Use) including through www.borrowell.com (the “Website”) and Borrowell’s mobile application (the “App”) and through other interactions with us.
Borrowell may provide third party content or links to third-party web sites or applications. When you leave our Services or interact with a third-party feature, you should read the applicable third party’s privacy policies and terms of service to make sure you understand how they might collect and share information about you.
We do not share your credit reports or credit scores with third parties (except agents acting on our behalf; as further explained below) and we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their advertising or marketing lists without your consent.
Collection and Use of Information
The ways we collect information about you include:
information you give us
information we collect from third parties about you
information we collect about you based on your use of our Services
Information you give us. You may give us information about you when you use our Services or by communicating with us. This includes information you provide when you create an account to get your free credit score and report, apply for a loan, answer specific questions through various forms, provide us with feedback, participate in surveys, contests or promotions and when you contact us with a question or to report a problem.
The information you give us may include your name, contact information (such as mailing address and email address), date of birth, income, information about your rent or mortgage payments, credit related information, your financial goals, referral source and your social insurance number. You are not required to provide your social insurance number in order to apply for a loan or enter into a loan agreement, or to sign-up for the personal finance service. However, if you choose to provide it, we use it to assist us in identifying you with credit reporting agencies and for internal fraud prevention purposes.
If you use some of our Services (such as if you are approved for a loan), we may ask you to provide other information including proof of income (such as pay stubs or Notices of Assessment from your tax return), your Canadian bank account details (account number, transit, etc.), purpose of the loan, and information regarding your employment such as occupation, current or former employer(s). We may also collect personal and employment references with your consent. We also require you to verify your bank account using a third party service to ensure we deposit your funds to the correct account (Borrowell does not receive your bank account login information). As part of this verification process, we may collect transaction history from your bank account in order to verify that your income deposits match the documents you have submitted and, in certain circumstances, to assess your suitability for the loan. We also verify your identity by asking you questions from Equifax or other identity verification service providers or by verifying your name, address, date of birth and mobile phone number with your mobile service provider.
We may monitor and record our telephone conversations with you for training and quality assurance purposes. You will be provided with a notice at the beginning of any call that is being recorded. If you do not wish to have your call recorded, please let us know.
Information we collect from third parties about you. We collect Personal Information from third parties or service providers with your consent or where otherwise permitted or required by law. This information includes, the credit reports and credit scores we obtain from Equifax or other credit reporting agencies, information about your credit history and other financial information which is relevant to the provision of our Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity. We also work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, service providers, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, social media) and may receive information from them, such as whether or not you have taken out a product with them, what other products you may have used, and other such details. We might also collect information from other users like you through things like a member referral program.
If you apply for a loan using our Website or App, you will be asked to provide consent to Borrowell obtaining a credit score and/or report from a credit reporting agency. By providing such consent, you consent to Borrowell or its service provider, affiliates or agents obtaining and using credit and other personal information about you (including credit reports) from any credit reporting agency, and exchanging information with any of them, on an ongoing basis. You acknowledge that this consent is effective immediately upon submitting your application and is being obtained to determine your eligibility for a loan, and if approved, to open and administer your loan, review and verify your ongoing creditworthiness, and manage and assess risk. You authorize any credit reporting agency to provide this information to Borrowell and any of its service providers, affiliates or agents.
If you register for an account in order to obtain a free credit score and/or credit report, Borrowell will obtain your consent and collect personal information (first and last name, date of birth, mailing address and telephone number) in order to obtain and provide you with your credit score and/or credit report for free from Equifax or another consumer reporting agency. Your credit report may include information such as the types and amounts of credit advanced to you, payment histories, negative banking items, collection actions, legal proceedings, previous bankruptcies and other information reported by your creditors. Borrowell also collects additional personal information from you, including your email address, financial goals, annual income range, and referral source. Borrowell uses your credit score, information from your credit report and other information you provide in order to better understand your financial needs and credit history, and provide you with tailored personal finance information, educational insights and recommendations which may include information on steps to improve your credit score, as well as personalized offers for Borrowell and third party financial services products and services that may be of interest to you based on your credit-related and other information. Borrowell will obtain and provide your credit score and credit report to you for free at the time of account creation and on a regular basis thereafter as long as you have an account with Borrowell in order to provide you with up-to-date information and offers. If you wish to withdraw your consent to the collection and use of your credit score and credit report information, you may close your account at any time by contacting service@borrowell.com.
