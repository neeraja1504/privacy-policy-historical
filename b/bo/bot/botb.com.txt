If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
In addition to the above, we may also anonymise and aggregate your personal data in a way which means you cannot be identified. This may be helpful to us for testing our internal systems, carrying out research and general customer data analysis. Because this is not personally identifiable, we can use this for any purposes.
WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH?
Importantly, we do not pass your personal data onto any third parties for them to market their products/services to you. If in the future we decide that we want to, we will only do so if we have your consent.
We do however share your personal data with third parties to help us deliver our products and services to you in the most effective way possible. These include third parties who assist us with:
* Delivering relevant BOTB email and text marketing (to the extent you have not unsubscribed)
* Our customer reviews and surveys
* Personalising the content on our website to ensure a tailored user experience
* Delivering relevant targeted and re-targeted advertising to keep you up to date with our services
* Detecting fraud or criminal activity
* Creating your BOTB account (being your social media companies who you have used to provide log-in information as part of the sign-up process)
* Running our competitions, such as our auditors, judges, professional advisors
* Other aspects of our service delivery, such as hosting our website and processing customer payments
If we share personal data with third parties, we will ensure that access is limited on a strictly need to know basis and is subject to suitable obligations relating to confidentiality and security. Please note that certain of these third party service providers use cookies or other tracking technologies, which are explained more fully in our Cookies Policy
In addition to the above, we may also be required to share your personal data with third parties if required by law or regulation. In such circumstances, we will make sure that the disclosure is only to the extent required by law or regulation.
DO WE SEND ANY OF YOUR DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EEA?
The European Economic Area or “EEA” is deemed to have good standards when it comes to data privacy. As such, we consciously limit the occasions when we may need to transfer or handle your data outside of the EEA. Where we do, for example where our service providers are based outside of the EEA, we make sure that your data is still treated fairly and lawfully in all respects (including making sure we have a legal ground for sending your data outside the EEA and putting in place all necessary safeguards for such arrangement).
Where relevant, you will have the right to see a copy of any safeguards we put in place for international transfers of your data. Just get in touch with us if you would like to find out more.
HOW WE KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE?
We adopt industry standard security processes to ensure your data is kept safe and secure and to prevent unauthorised access or use or loss of your data. By way of example, we use secure server software (EV SSL) which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. We also make sure that third parties who need to handle your data when helping us to deliver our services are subject to suitable confidentiality and security standards.
Despite the security measures we implement, please be aware that the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted to us via the internet will be completely secure and any transmission is at your own risk.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR?
We will keep your data for as long as you hold a BOTB account and/or where you are still happy to hear from us about our latest news, products and services. Once you no longer wish to be engaged with BOTB we may still need to keep hold of your data if there is a legal reason for doing so (such as for tax purposes where you have made purchases to play in our competitions or where we need to resolve any disputes with you).
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our website we do not have any control over these third party websites and are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites. Your use of these third party sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and examine the privacy policies and terms of use applicable to the web sites in question.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
If we amend our Privacy Policy, it will be published on the BOTB.com website so please check back regularly to see if there have been any updates. If we make any substantial changes, we may also email you if it’s appropriate.
YOUR RIGHTS
In certain situations, you are entitled to:
* **access** a copy of your personal data;
* **correct or update** your personal data, which you can do yourself by logging into your account or if you would prefer, please contact us and we can help you out;
* **erase** your personal data;
* **object** to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (as set out in the above table);
* **restrict** the processing of your personal data;
* request the **transfer** of your personal data to a third party; or
* where you have provided your consent to certain of our processing activities, in certain circumstances, you may **withdraw your consent** at any time (but please note that we may continue to process such personal data if we have legitimate legal grounds for doing so).
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please Contact Us. You don’t have to pay a fee to exercise your rights, unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (in which case we can charge a reasonable fee). Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. Where your request is legitimate, we will always respond within one month (unless there is a legal reason to take longer, such as where your request is particularly complex). We may also need you to confirm your identity before we proceed with your request if it is not clear to us who is making the request.
In addition to the above, you may get in touch with the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) if you are concerned about the way in which we are handling your personal data. However, where possible, we would really appreciate you speaking with us first if you have any concerns.
HOW TO OPT-OUT OF BOTB MARKETING
You can opt-out of any BOTB marketing at any time either by Contacting Us or by using the opt-out function detailed in the relevant marketing email. Please note that we may still need to send you service notifications by email, such as advising you of updated privacy terms or terms of play.
We do not pass your data onto any third parties for their marketing purposes. However, if we ever wish to do so in the future we will always get your consent. You can then opt-out from any third party marketing at anytime following the same process as above.
