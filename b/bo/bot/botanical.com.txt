Privacy Statement
Our Promise
Your information remains confidential. We pledge to regard your privacy with the highest degree of respect.
Our Policy
All information related to the transactions of Botanical.com customers is considered highly confidential. Transaction information about our customers is never rented, loaned, or sold to any third party. We believe that our customers have a right to know what information we might collect about them and why. We will personally address any privacy question or concern with any of our customers. Please e-mail Customer serive with any questions.
Order Confirmation
We will send email to acknowledge your orders with us. Under no circumstances would we ever expose any of your financial information (e.g. credit card number) in email.
We Use The Toughest Encryption We Can
Our computers are set up to automatically use the highest level of encryption that your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Netscape) can legally handle. We maintain full 128-bit digital encryption certificate for your protection.
We Don't Charge You Until We Check & Ship
Your credit card is not billed until we ship what you paid for. We use a sophisticated form of address verification for all credit transactions to protect us and our customers against fraud. If the billing address for the credit card does not match the shipping address for a customer, we hold the order for verbal, personal verification. We are happy to arrange all manner of off-line payments (such as money orders and bank checks, personal checks, etc.) with you. E-mail us to arrange alternate payment methods. We vigorously pursue all attempts at intentional credit card fraud and will ignore any concept of confidentiality or privacy when dealing with fraudulent transactions.
You Have a Right to Complain
If you believe we have violated your trust for any reason, at any time, in any manner we will respond immediately. We pledge to resolve any problem to your satisfaction or work with your choice of recognized consumer advocate towards resolution. We are committed to your personal satisfaction with each and every purchase you make from Botanical.com. Of course, we "can't fix what we don't know is broke," and we sincerely appreciate the rare opportunity to hear that we should have worked harder for your business.
We reserve the right to change or amend this policy at any time.
