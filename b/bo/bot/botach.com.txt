Return Policy
Our return policy is backed by a 100% money back guarantee. You have 15 days from the time of your orders delivery to notify us of any intent to return merchandise. You can fill out an RMA# Form (Return Authorization) on our Customer Service page. All products must be returned in original condition and contain all manufacturer packaging and tags.
If an item proves to be defective within the 15-day return policy or is shipped incorrectly, we will be more than happy to cover the return shipping to have the item replaced or credited to you. We may ask that you return merchandise directly to the manufacturer if it is after our 15-day return policy if the product is covered by any manufacturer warranty.
Shipping Policy
All of our orders are shipped UPS or USPS . With our Free Standard Ground Shipping option we retain the right to choose the best method for freight. If the ultimate destination for your package requires a specific method because the area has limited access, you are required to pay for shipping. A customer is also required to pay for shipping if he/she needs expedited shipping .
Cancellation Policy
You may cancel your order via email at cs@botach.com or by phone at 1-888-344-5145 if a tracking number is not yet available for the item or order. The sooner you do it, the better it is as we cannot guarantee return of package once it’s in transit and you will be required to cover any fuel charges if the package has already shipped and you decided to cancel late.
Funds take anywhere from 24-72 hours to be processed back into your account. You are always notified of any credit issued to you via email.
International Policy
Yes, we do ship outside of the U.S. However, the methods of payment for international orders are different than those nationwide. We do adhere to all ITAR rules and regulations for the exportation of restricted items.
