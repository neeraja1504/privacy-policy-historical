The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Sites, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:
Name and Contact Data. We collect your email address which is necessary to use our services (e.g. receive a confirmation e-mail once your submission is approved, modified or rejected, you forget your password and you request a new one, you contact us for any issue related to our services), and any detail you provide to enhance your listing’s details page. You are fully responsible for the accuracy of the provided data.

We store information that we collect through log files, and via the information provided during the BOTW Submit service, to create a profile of our users.

Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage, in a locked facility.If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can contact our Help Center.
However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.
