In order to perform the desired travel agent function, BookingHit.com shares the customer's personal data with third parties to perform service contracts in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR.
BookingHit.com sends the 'guest details' (name and the country that issued the passport) provided by the customer to the hotel provider, which in turn forwards that information to the hotel to book the room.

Whenever you visit a country where your rights and freedoms are not fully respected, there is a risk that your personal data is treated the same way. BookingHit.com provides the hotel with your personal data to the same extent as you should do when you would check-in to your room in person at the same hotel.
Obligatory Data Transfer
In some cases, BookingHit.com has to use the customer's personal data to resolve legal issues, e.g. regulatory audits and compliance, police investigations or to enforce the terms of use of the BookingHit.com reservation service could be expected.

You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.

Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend our legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
