YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided
Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for
personal, family, or household purposes ("California Users") is entitled to request information
about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third
parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of
Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a California Users, the business is required to
provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding
calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the
business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing
California Users' Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless
the California Users first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains
and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the
California Users of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a
cost free means to exercise that right.
As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications
from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later
decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the
third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should
always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how
that entity will handle your information.
California Users may request further information about our compliance with this law by

one request per user each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means
other than through our Site.
