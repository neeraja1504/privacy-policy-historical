BookBrowse.com's privacy statement
Purpose and Data Minimization
BookBrowse is an online magazine for booklovers - including reviews, previews, "beyond the book" articles, author interviews, and reading guides. We collect and use your personal information with your approval, and within the framework of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the legislation of the United Kingdom related to data protection.
Personal Information
BookBrowse.com does not collect any personal information about you, unless you explicitly provide it.
In the case of members, we store basic contact information required to provide the services you have requested.
If you subscribe to one of our free newsletters, we use a third-party email host for mailings, so your name and email address are not stored on BookBrowse at all but instead are securely stored at our email host, Constant Contact. You can unsubscribe to any of our emails, or manage your subscriptions, by going to our subscriptions page.
Email addresses collected when people enter BookBrowse giveaways, quizzes or take part in surveys are used only to select the winning names unless explicitly stated otherwise (for example, if a giveaway offers the opportunity to receive information from a publisher, the email address and first name of those who choose to opt-in will be provided to the publisher.)
If you win a book in a giveaway, or are a member and request a book to read for either our First Impressions or Book Club program, we will give your name and mailing address to the publisher as part of the mailing list for the book but always with explicit instructions that the list is to be used only to mail the specific book to the specific people listed, and is not to be stored for future use. From time to time the books being mailed may be e-books, in which case we would provide your first name and email address to the publisher, with the same explicit instruction that the list is only to be used for the one-time mailing.
We have never and will never sell, give-away or rent our mailing list.
The only time we would ever knowingly share your information would be with your express permission, or if ordered by a court of law.
Financial Information
We make every effort to protect BookBrowse from malicious attack, and comply with industry best practices and standards such as Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards.
We do not store any credit card information on BookBrowse - it is passed directly to our payment processor, Paypal.

Cookies
BookBrowse (like the majority of websites) uses "cookies". When you visit us, BookBrowse's server sends a tiny file (cookie) to your computer containing a sequence of letters and numbers. This is stored on your computer in a special folder for cookies.
If you visit BookBrowse again, your computer will check its files to see if a cookie matches, and if so it will send this little file back to BookBrowse, so that you are recognized as a returning visitor. This helps us calculate how many people visit in total and when they visit, but we do not collect personal information about you at all. We also do not track or record your visits to other websites, or any other Internet activity not related to BookBrowse.
This is what the contents of a typical BookBrowse cookie file looks like:

Advertising
Occasionally publishers running ads on BookBrowse use third-party advertising companies to serve their ads. If you click on these ads, the advertiser may then use cookies to track your visits to their and other websites in order to provide ads that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice, or you would like to opt out from having your data collected by some advertising networks, visit the DAA opt-out program (currently available at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI opt out program (currently available at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).
European visitors may wish to visit the EDAA opt-out program (currently available at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).
Tell-A-Friend
Visitors sometimes wish to tell a friend about a particular page at BookBrowse, or send themselves a reminder. For this reason, like many other websites, BookBrowse provides a convenient 'tell-a-friend' tool that allows you to send a personal message to a friend telling them about BookBrowse.
Email addresses are used only to send this one-time message, and are not stored or recorded by BookBrowse in any way.
"My Reading List"
Members have the option of creating and storing book lists on BookBrowse - for example to keep track of books read and to read. Members can also record their personal thoughts on these books. At this time, member reading lists can only be viewed by the individual member when that member is logged in. They are not available to the general public to view at all. Some members have requested that BookBrowse provide the ability for lists to be made public - either so that the member can provide access to specific people or so that their lists are freely available to all internet users. At the moment BookBrowse does not allow this, but if we were to in the future, the default setting would be that a list remains private unless an individual member specifically opts to make his or her list(s) public.

Third Party Content
BookBrowse contains a considerable amount of information provided by third parties, including, but not limited to, advertising, excerpts, reviews, interviews, book summaries and text links.

BookBrowse LLC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party sites, and a link to a third party site should not be seen as an endorsement by BookBrowse of that site.
The "Buy This Book" links contain affiliate information, which means BookBrowse may receive a small commission if you purchase the book using these links.
