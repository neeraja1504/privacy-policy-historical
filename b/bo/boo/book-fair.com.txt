This website uses SSL encryption for the secure and safe transmission of sensitive contents, e.g. for the registration in My Book Fair. You can recognise an encrypted connection when the address field of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and when the padlock icon appears in your browser line. When the SSL encryption is enabled your data cannot be read by third parties during the transmission.

Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies” – text files that are stored on your computer in order to enable an analysis of the use of the website that is accessed by you. The cookies-generated information about your use of the website is usually transferred to a Google server in the United States of America and stored there. If the IP anonymization on this website is activated, your IP address will be truncated within member states of the EU or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, your full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the United States of America and shortened there. Upon request of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to analyse your use of the website to compile reports on website activities to the website operator and to provide other services relating to the use of the website and the internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser via Google Analytics will not be amalgamated with other data of Google. You have the possibility to prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser settings correspondingly; please note that you may not be able to use all the functions of this website if you block the storage of cookies.

Google Tag Manager
Our website uses the Google Tag Manager for the provision of all tags (Google Analytics) or banner ads or for other targeting measures.
Tags are small code elements on the website that help measuring the traffic and the visitor behaviour, capturing the impact of online advertising and of social channels, using remarketing and orientation towards target groups and testing and optimising the website.
Google Tag Manager tracks a series of tags and firing triggers that are defining when these tags are to be applied on the website. When a user visits the website, the current tag configuration is sent to the browser of the user. It contains instructions which tags are to be activated: Click here to read more about how Google Tag Manager works.
Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows the marketers to manage website tags via a user interface. The tool Tag Manager itself (that implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain. The tool ensures that other tags are activated that will gather data, if necessary. Google Tag Manager does not access these data. Deactivating tags on domain level or cookie level, will implement this deactivation for all tracking tags that are implemented with the Google Tag Manager.

Subscribing to and unsubscribing from (objection) our newsletter and information services
The website of Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH offers its visitors the possibility to subscribe to the information and newsletter services of our company. The volume and nature of personal data transmitted during the subscription process to the particular information or newsletter service depends on the input mask you use.
Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH informs its customers and business partners about the offers of the company in regular intervals by means of information and newsletter services. The information and newsletter services of our company can generally be received by the interested parties only if (1) they have a valid e-mail account and (2) they have registered for information or newsletter services. We rely on the “double opt-in” process. For legal reasons, a confirmation is sent to the e-mail address that was entered by the person registering for the first time for the information or newsletter service. This confirmation e-mail is sent out to confirm that the owner of the e-mail address, as the data subject, has authorised the receipt of the information and/or newsletter service.
If you register for the information and/or newsletter services, we will also store the IP address that the internet service provider (ISP) has assigned to the computer system that was used by you at the time of the registration, including the date and the time of the log-in. It is necessary to collect these data to be able to track any possible abuse of your e-mail address at a later point of time and thus serves the legal protection of those responsible for the processing of the data.
The personal data gathered during the subscription of the information and newsletter services are used only for providing our informations and newsletter services. Furthermore, subscribers of information and newsletter services can be notified by e-mail if this should be necessary for the operation of the information and/or newsletter service or if a registration is required, e.g. in the case of changes to the information and newsletter services or changes of the technology. The personal data that is gathered within the scope of the information and newsletter services will not be disclosed to third parties. The data subject may at any time cancel the subscription to our information and newsletter services. He or she may at any time withdraw the consent to the storage of personal data that was given for the purpose of using the information and newsletter services. Each information and newsletter service offers a link specifically for the withdrawal of the consent.
Newsletter-Tracking
The information and newsletter services offered by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in e-mails that are sent in the HTML format and it permits log file recording and log file analysis. This enables the statistical interpretation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. By means of the embedded tracking pixel, Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH can identify if an e-mail was opened by a user and when it was opened and which of the links contained in the e-mail were accessed by the user.
The data gathered by means of these tracking pixels that are contained in the information and newsletter services are stored and analysed by us in order to optimise the mailings and to better adapt the content of future information and newsletter services to the preferences of the client. These personal data are not conveyed to third parties. The data subjects may at any time withdraw the consent that they have given separately by means of the “double opt-in” process. Following the revocation, these personal data are deleted. Unsubscribing from the information and newsletter services will be treated automatically as revocation by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH.
Possibilities to raise objections
Any data subject has the possibility to object to the use of his or her data for advertising purposes. Please send your objection to privacy@buchmesse.de or to: Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH, Datenschutzbeauftragte, Braubachstr. 16, 60311 Frankfurt am Main.
Each data subject has the right to object to the processing of his or her personal data, unless the storage of data is a legal obligation in connection with the business processes. Please send your objection in writing to privacy@buchmesse.de or to: Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH, Datenschutzbeauftragte, Braubachstr. 16, 60311 Frankfurt am Main.
In addition, each individual (data subject) has the following rights:
the right to be informed if and what kind of the individual’s personal data are collected and retained by us;
the right to make a request for immediate rectification and/or completion if personal data are incorrect or incomplete and the right to receive a supplementary explanation;
the right to make a request for erasure of the personal data;
the right to make a request for restriction of processing of the data;
