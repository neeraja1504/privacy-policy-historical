Bookshare, Read2Go, and Go Read
Bookshare® is a nonprofit website dedicated to providing accessible books and other materials ("Content") to people with print disabilities. We have also partnered with outside organizations and developers to provide our members with mobile e-reader applications, such as Read2Go and Go Read. These e-reader applications allow members to access e-books from Bookshare on their mobile devices. In order to provide these services, Bookshare collects, uses, and shares certain information relating to its members’ disability status, education, veteran status, and book-related information, as more fully described below. This information may be input by you directly, or may be input on your behalf by an Organizational Member such as a school, veterans’ organization, or other organization that provides services to people with print disabilities.
Information Bookshare Collects
Disability Status
In order to comply with the laws that allow Bookshare to provide copyrighted material to people with print disabilities, Bookshare must receive proof of a print-related disability, which may include medical information, for each member who wishes to receive copyrighted Content. Further, because Bookshare was built to serve members with print disabilities, Bookshare may collect other information that reflects the nature of its member’s disabilities. For example, Bookshare may collect information that a certain member prefers to read books in Braille and was referred to Bookshare by a school for the blind.
If a member joins Bookshare through an organization, then the Organizational Member typically collects the member’s proof of disability, not Bookshare. However, the Organizational Member may share the nature of the member’s disability with Bookshare, and will be obligated to provide the proof of disability to Bookshare on request.
To streamline the process of verifying eligibility, Bookshare has agreements in place with other nonprofit organizations serving people with disabilities (“Verification Partners”), including National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (“NLS”), Learning Ally (formerly RFB&D), Hadley School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and various US and international organizations. If a potential member has already provided proof of disability to one of our Verification Partners, the potential member may use this proof to sign up for Bookshare by filling out our online form. Upon receipt of this form, Bookshare will send the user’s name, address, email, birth date, and/or other information on the submitted form to the Verification Partner, and the Verification Partner will provide confirmation that the member has a qualifying disability.
Educational Information and Veteran Status
Bookshare partners with the Department of Education to provide free access to students in the United States. Bookshare also partners with other nonprofit and for-profit organizations to provide greater access to children with qualifying print disabilities. To further this goal, Bookshare collects information on members’ education, including but not limited to members’ grade, birth date, school name, school address, school district, and whether the student is enrolled in a qualifying Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) or a 504 Plan.
Bookshare also collects information on whether or not a member is a minor. For each member with an Individual Membership who is a minor, Bookshare will collect the contact information of the member’s guardian, such as the guardian’s name, e-mail address, postal address, zip code, and telephone number.
Finally, Bookshare collects information on whether the user is a US Veteran. This information is only used to provide free or discounted services and special programs to qualifying Veterans, and in aggregated, de-identified reporting.
Book-Related Information
Bookshare is dedicated to expanding access to books for members with qualifying print disabilities. To further this goal, Bookshare maintains transaction logs of the materials downloaded by its users. These transaction logs contain information such as the title and author, the member who downloaded the book, the date and time of the download, the format of the download, and the status of the download. Further, for each download of a copyrighted work, Bookshare embeds a digital fingerprint in the book download. Bookshare stores this digital fingerprint in its transaction logs so that it can trace downloaded material back to the original downloader to determine the source of any unauthorized copies of Bookshare material.
If a member uses the Read Now option to launch a book using Bookshare Web Reader, Bookshare also records whether the book was opened by the member and remembers the last read location to keep the member’s place in the book.
Bookshare also stores each reader’s preferred download format and preferred language.
As part of its efforts to build and improve the Bookshare collection, Bookshare accepts uploads of Content, accessibility improvements (such as image descriptions), and reviews of books and of particular versions of books from its qualified users, organizations, and volunteers. Bookshare will maintain transaction logs of these activities.
Information from our International Partners
If a member lives outside of the United States, Bookshare may also receive information from an international Membership Partner. For our international members, the International Partner in the member’s country of residence will collect the member’s proof of disability, not Bookshare. However, the International Partner may share the nature of your disability with Bookshare, and will be obligated to provide the proof of disability to Bookshare on request. The International Partner may also process international members’ subscriptions payments in the local currency and transfer a portion of the payments to Bookshare.
Use of Information
In addition to the general uses described in the Benetech Privacy Policy, Bookshare may use personal information:
To verify that a potential member has a qualifying disability.
To flag usage that is potentially in violation of our terms of use or copyright law, and to investigate and support legal proceedings concerning alleged violations of domestic or international copyright laws.
In cases of suspected abuse where copyrighted Content has been made available to unqualified individuals, to trace copyrighted Content back to the user using the user-identifiable information embedded in downloaded Content.
To remember your last place in a given piece of Content.
To provide suggested content based on the user’s past reading patterns.
In the case of minors, to limit access to Content coded as adult Content.
To track the quality of uploads and reviews by users, organizations, and volunteers. In particular, we may identify the uploading person with the Content on the website, and may also publicize particularly high quality uploaders of Content or reviewers.
To provide information in the course of communications between our Services and compatible e-reading applications, including Read2Go and Go Read. If you choose to use an e-reading application to use Bookshare, that product will have access to certain information from your account. Similarly, if you have an Organizational Membership, the persons responsible for your Organizational Member account may use an e-reading application to access your information. For example, e-reading applications can access your name, account settings, and history of downloading books.
Sharing of Information
In addition to the general uses described in the Benetech Privacy Policy, Bookshare may use personal information:
Upon your request, to streamline the process of verifying eligibility for services run by our Verification Partner Learning Ally. If Learning Ally requests that we verify your disability, we may confirm or deny that you have provided us with a proof of disability.
To confirm the accuracy of a member’s information with our International Partners. We will only share information with our International Partners that the International Partner originally collected—the International Partner will not have direct access to individual members’ personal information maintained by Bookshare.
To provide aggregate reports on Bookshare usage to government, nonprofit, and for-profit partners such as publishers and developers of e-readers and other assistive technology tools. These reports may include aggregated information on the number of books downloaded by Bookshare users in a given time frame, and this information may be broken down by demographic information such as location or school district. Further, these aggregate reports may be used by Bookshare or its partners to advertise their products, to compete for grants, or for any other purpose. However, these reports will not include any personally identifiable information that can be associated with any individual Bookshare member.
To provide usage information about individuals’ accounts to the person(s) responsible for associated Organizational Member accounts. For example, we will provide detailed information on the contact information, reading history, and reading preferences of the organization’s staff or members to that organization.
