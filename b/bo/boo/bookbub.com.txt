Cookies. We may log information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your device by a website.

When we use the term "anonymous data," we’re referring to data and information that doesn’t permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.
We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make personal data into anonymous data by excluding information, such as your name, that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our sites.

If you have a social profile on BookBub, then certain information may be publicly visible, including your name and username; other users you’re following; and your reactions, ratings, and reviews that you share with other BookBub users.

You can control the information that is publicly visible on your profile by adjusting your privacy settings.
We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information, on our sites.
