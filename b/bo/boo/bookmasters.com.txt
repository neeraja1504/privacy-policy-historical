Safe Harbor
Bookmasters recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”). Among other things, the Directive generally restricts the transfer of EU Personal Information to Bookmasters operations in the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such Personal Information when it is received in the United States.
In order to address this requirement, Bookmasters adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”) with respect to certain individually identifiable information about individuals in the European Union who are customers or employees of Bookmasters customers (“EU Customer Data”) and about individuals in the European Union who are Bookmasters or its affiliates’ employees (“EU Employee Data”) (collectively, EU Customer Data and Employee Data is referred to as “EU Personal Information”). Bookmasters practices concerning EU Employee Data is published to affected EU employees through other company policies and procedures. For more information about the Safe Harbor, please refer to the US Department of Commerce website at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
With respect to EU Customer Data, Bookmasters operates as a mere data processor for its customers located in the EU, and its customers remain the data controllers with respect to such information. Bookmasters therefore acts in accordance with the instructions of such customers regarding the collection, processing and transfer of EU Customer Data, the provision of access to and rectification of EU Customer Data, and other matters. Bookmasters also maintains reasonable security measures to safeguard EU Customer Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction and maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
