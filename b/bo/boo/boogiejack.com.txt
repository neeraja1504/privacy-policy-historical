If you subscribe to it your email address will never be sold, traded or given to anyone. I don't like spam and I don't participate in it.

The Long Version
I've created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate my firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses information gathering and dissemination practices.
This site contains links to other sites. BoogieJack.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites.
This site uses a secure order form for customers to purchase products and services. Visitor contact information and credit card numbers are collected when volunteered by the customer. Contact information is used to send orders to the customer and to notify them of upgrades and new products they may have an interested in. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the purchaser for products and services. No information about the purchaser is stored in permanent databases on the server. All orders are made through a 128-bit secure server, and all orders receive approval from Visa/MasterCard before products or services are rendered.
Cookies are used to remember your order from one page to the next when you use the shopping cart to purchase goods or services. The cart will not work without cookies.
Your IP address is recored to help identify you and your shopping cart if you purchase anything, and to prevent criminals from perpetuating credit card fraud against you or this business.
Occasionally, online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like age, income level, education, etc). Specific information is not shared in any way with 3rd parties. General information (like 65% of those polled make purchases online, are female, etc.) may be shared with potential advertisers to help them decide if my audience is right for their ad campaign. Again, specific information such as names, email addresses, etc, ARE NEVER SHARED.
Occasional contests are offered where visitors are asked for contact information. The customer's contact information is used to contact the contestant when necessary, such as to notify the winner that they've won.
This site does NOT intentionally collect contact information from children, however, children do have access to contest forms, surveys, and email links in which they may submit information without parental consent or parental knowledge. Such information, if received, will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and is never used for other purposes nor shared with any 3rd parties for any reason.
