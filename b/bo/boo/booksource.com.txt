BOOKSOURCE.COM. PRIVACY POLICY
BOOKSOURCE.COM. PRIVACY POLICY
The following policy (this “Privacy Policy”) applies to BOOKSOURCE.COM and any other site owned and/or operated
by or on behalf of Booksource Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, that states that it is governed by this Privacy Policy
and/or links to this Privacy Policy (the sites are collectively referred to herein as "Booksource.com" and the entities
are collectively referred to herein as "Booksource"). By accessing or using Booksource.com, you are accepting the
terms of this Privacy Policy. Booksource is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This
policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers, librarians, etc.) with an overview of the measures we
have taken to provide a safe online environment. This Privacy Policy applies to our online practices only.
Please note that we may revise our above policy without notice to users as the content on our sites continues to
change and we will post all such material changes on this Privacy Policy.
The effective date of this Privacy Policy is June 2011.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable information: first and last name, e-mail
address, street address and phone number. We (and/or our agents or affiliates) may collect online and use personally
identifiable information from our adult visitors: (1) to process and fulfill orders for products or services (such as
catalog requests); (2) in connection with contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations,
content submissions, classroom activities, our requests for suggestions and visitors' requests for information; and (3)
to customize the content on our site for our visitors' current and future needs. In addition, this personally identifiable
information may be used to provide our visitors, via e-mail or other means, information about materials and activities
that may be of interest to them. We will never sell or trade personally identifiable information to a third party.
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF
COOKIE TECHNOLOGY
We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a software technology called "cookies," through
pixel tags, and through our visitors' voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally
identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitors' browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or
Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or
NET.COM) and other similar information which we track in aggregate form. Cookie technology helps us to know how
many people visit us and where visitors go on our site. Cookies are small bits of information we send to your
computer. Pixel tags are very small graphic images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web
beacons" or "clear GIFs". The site may also use cookies known as “Flash” cookies, which are stored on the hard
drive of the user’s computer or device using the Adobe Flash media player that is installed on it. Among other things,
the non-personally identifiable information collected through these means allows us to know which areas are
favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used by our
visitors so that we may continually improve our visitors' online experiences. Most web browsers give you a way to
refuse or disable most cookies (but not Flash cookies). To refuse or disable Flash cookies, you must set the Flash
player on your computer or device to reject or delete them. If you choose to disable, refuse, reject or delete cookies,
some of the functionality of our site may no longer be available to you.
THIRD PARTIES
Booksource may share with third parties certain aggregated, anonymous, non-personal information, such as
the number of users and demographic profile of who searched a particular category or specific item, for
example, or how many users clicked on or responded to a particular advertisement. This information does
not identify any user individually.
Booksource may offer services in connection with other websites or service providers. Personal information that you
provide to those service providers is subject to the terms, conditions and privacy practices of those service providers.
The service providers may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties
without your consent. We may hire other companies or individuals outside Booksource to provide services on our
behalf such as answering customer questions about products or services or performing statistical analysis of our
services. We will only provide those companies or other trusted businesses the information they need to deliver the
service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purposes.
We require that these parties process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy
Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Booksource, information
collected through Booksource.com may be combined with information obtained through other Booksource services.
USE OF IP ADDRESSES
We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of Booksource.com. An IP address is a number
assigned to your computer by a Web server when you're on the Web. When you are on our site, we have a back-end
server that logs your computer's IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in
the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to
identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may
be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED
Booksource may request additional information from you on product order forms or other online transaction forms.
Such forms may require you to provide contact information (such as name and mailing or shipping address) and
payment information (such as credit card number and credit card expiration date). Information that you provide may
be used for billing and accounting purposes, for recording products and services that you have licensed, bought or
downloaded, and to fill your orders. Booksource may use contact information to communicate with you about orders,
products, services, or fees or charges. Booksource may use an outside shipping company to ship orders and may
use a credit card processing company to process payments for goods and services. These companies have access
to user information, which may include personal information, in order to perform their functions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION FOR SECURITY PURPOSES
Booksource may disclose your personal information in the good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or
disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, or to comply with
legal processes or enforceable government request served on us; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service including
investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical
issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Booksource, our employees, users of
our products or services, or members of the public as required or permitted by law.
BUYER OR TRANSFEREE
Booksource may disclose and/or transfer your personal information to a buyer or transferee of all or a portion of its
assets in conjunction with the sale or transfer of such assets; however, we will provide notice on our website before
personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
