Disclosure
The Stuff We Write About
We educate through tips, tutorials and insights on all aspects of starting and running a WooCommerce online store.
Affiliate Links Disclosure
Yes, this is one of the primary sources of our income. You are going to find a lot of links here on our site, and many of them are affiliate links. A large percentage of them are services and products we have used for a long time ourselves. There are others scattered in posts on products and services we have tested and feel you should know about. If you click on any of those links, we make a few bucks and you don’t pay anymore. This blog is our business, not a side gig to collect a little cash, so we appreciate any time you purchase through one of these links.
Podcast Sponsors
Our podcast has up to two sponsors per episode. They are clearly noted on both the post and in the podcast. Their sponsorship helps us continue to produce our podcasts by covering out-of-pocket costs and production costs.
Partners
Anyone listed as a partner on our site is a result of a long relationship we have had with them. Support has gone both ways with these partners.
About Our Site and Content
What We Don’t Talk About
Any site that resells WooCommerce plugins, themes or extensions that are not their own property and are developed and owned by another vendor, will not be shared or mentioned on this site. Even though GPL allows this, we don’t feel this is ethical or to the advantage of the user or owner of the products and service.
Guest Posts
We do not accept or publish unsolicited guest posts. Rarely do we publish guest posts and they are by invite only to people we know will produce content that fits our site.
Links and Sponsored Links
First off, we will not add any link to a post that is solicited or unsolicited. Secondly, we do not accept money for links. If you have a link you want us to place in any of our content, whether for free or paid, we do not accept them.
Infographics
Please don’t send us a request to post your infographic, as we do not add those upon request as well.
Nothing Is Set In Stone
Yes, we can and will at times change stuff in our posts without notification to our readers. We can’t help it. We like to keep things updated when we can.
Affiliations
We are not directly affiliated with WordPress, WooCommerce or Automattic.
