Introduction
The information we receive, and how we use it, depends on what you do when visiting our Site. We collect and use your non-personal information (information that is not identifiable to you personally) differently than your personal information.

The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.
What do we do with non-personal information?
Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information. We are always looking for ways to better serve you and improve our Site. We will use non-personal information to help us make this Site more useful to its users. We also will use non-personal information for other business purposes. For example, we may use individual non-personal information or aggregate non-personal information to create reports for internal use to develop programs, products, services or content.
We may use third-party tracking and advertising providers to act on our behalf to track and analyze your usage of our Site through the use of cookies, pixel tags/web beacon, and similar technologies. These third parties may collect, and share with us, as we may request, website usage information about visits to our Site, measure and research the effectiveness of our marketing, and track page usage and paths followed during visits to our Site. Also, these third-party providers may place our Internet banner advertisements on other websites that you visit, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners’ websites to our Site. The information collected on our behalf by these third parties does not contain your name, address, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.

We will not sell, exchange or publish your personal information, except in conjunction with a corporate sale, merger, dissolution, or acquisition.
We may be legally compelled to release your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation.

What about privacy on other websites?
This Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other website. We are not responsible for the performance of websites operated by third parties or for your business dealings with them. Therefore, whenever you click-through to other websites from this Site we recommend that you review each website’s privacy practices and make your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.
Do we ever communicate directly with visitors to this Site?
We may contact you periodically by email, mail or telephone if you agree to that contact to provide information regarding programs, products, services and content that may be of interest to you. In addition, some of the features on this Site allow you to communicate with us using an online form. If your communication requests a response from us, we may send you a response via email. The email response or confirmation may include your personal information, including your name, address, etc. We cannot guarantee that our emails to you will be secure from unauthorized interception.

Are there special rules about children’s privacy?
We care about protecting the online privacy of children. We will not intentionally collect any personal information (such as a child’s name or e-mail address) from children under the age of 18. If you think that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 18, please contact legal@bostondynamics.com.
What about website security?
Security is very important to us. We also understand that security is important to you. We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from this Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.
Applicable Laws
Boston Dynamics is headquartered in the United States of America.  Our use of personal information is subject to applicable US privacy laws.  However, we also comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to personal information that is collected via our Site.

You have the right to request access to your personal data, to have your personal data corrected, restricted or deleted, and to object to our processing of your personal data.  You also have the right of data portability, which means that you can request that we provide you (or a third party you designate) with a transferable copy of personal information that you have provided to us.  Your rights may be subject to various limitations under the GDPR. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or if you have any concerns about our processing of your personal data, please contact us in any of the ways listed in the “How to contact Boston Dynamics” section below.
