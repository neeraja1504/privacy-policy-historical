4. Usage Information
Like most websites, apps and other like services, the online services gather traffic patterns, usage information, and similar data. This usage data may identify you individually and we may associate it with Personal Information that we collect from you on the online services and related to any Program(s) you participate in and as otherwise described in this Notice. (See the “Information We Collect” and “How We Use the Information We Collect” sections of this Notice and any applicable individual Program terms for more details.)

Boston Market and/or our third-party Vendors may use cookies, pixels and web beacons (described below), device identifiers such as IDFA for iOS or Advertising ID for Android, device location features or beacons, or other similar technology (“Tracking Technologies”), to enhance the browsing and usage experience on the Services and enable certain functionality related to our Services.

Cookies and other technologies
“Cookies” are small text files or records that are stored on your web browser or device when you visit a website. To block cookies used on the online services, you can clear your browser(s) of all existing cookies and set your browser(s) to refuse cookies. The “help” functionality of your browser(s) will explain how to do this. If you refuse cookies, your experience on the online services, some Programs, and some of our online advertising may be affected. For example you may not be able to utilize all of the features on the Services.
“Pixels” or “web beacons” are small objects or images used by a website or third-party ad server to cause a cookie to track a user’s activity on particular sites and/or using particular advertising/links, for example, to record that a user has visited a particular webpage or viewed a particular email, and to collect other information about that user on that site, including the IP address of the computer (and therefore infer information, such as geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude)), web pages being viewed, date/time viewed, and user activity on a particular page.
We, and our vendors who provide services to us, may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies on our online services and in other areas related to our business, such as online advertising, to collect information and provide you with the services or products that you have requested.
Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Click on the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features available on a website.
Some newer web browsers may have a “Do Not Track” preference that transmits a “Do Not Track” header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. Boston Market does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created. Some of our third-party Vendors may permit you to opt out using Do Not Track functionality.
Where video is available on our online services, we may target and track the videos you view. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through online services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, or until you withdraw your consent.
Please note the following:
You might be assigned a cookie when using our online services.
We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies and other similar technologies.
We may use both session (for the duration of your visit) and persistent (for the duration of a fixed period of time) cookies and other tracking technologies.
Our online services and other areas related to our business may have web beacons.
We use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology, to collect information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We may also combine the information collected by these technologies with information we have collected about you by other means that are described in this Notice.
We may use these technologies:
To uniquely identify you or your device;
To allow you to access and use our online services, where without them, our online services may not work properly;
To further system security where appropriate;
For statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our websites and mobile apps;
Improve our menu, menu items, products and services;
To help us monitor the performance (e.g., traffic, errors, page load time, popular sections, etc.) of our online services;
To remember you, for your convenience, when you visit our online services
To help customize your experience;
To market to you through targeted advertising; and
For other purposes described in the section of this Privacy Notice titled, “How we use the information we collect.”
For example, we may use certain technologies to determine whether you have opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail, how you use the pages and content in our mobile apps, or whether you have clicked on a Boston Market online advertisement.
Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites and devices, and when using our online services to further personalize your experience with us.
Targeted advertising
When you use our online services, we (and our vendors who provide services to us) may collect information about your activities so that we can provide you with advertising tailored to your interests.
Because we take part in advertising (“ad”) networks, you may see certain ads on other websites. Ad networks allow us to target the information we send you based on your interests, other information related to you, and contextual means. These ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through use of cookies, web beacons, and web-server logs. The ad networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be of particular interest to you. The ad networks we take part in may collect information about your visits to websites that also take part in the relevant ad network, such as the pages or advertisements you view and how you use the websites. We use this information, both on our online services and on third-party websites that take part in the ad networks, to provide you with advertising tailored to you, and to help us assess how effective our marketing is. This may include to engage in targeted and personalized online advertising on the Services, on third-party websites, mobile apps, TV, or other online or offline services operated by third parties.
This marketing may be targeted to you based on Personal or Other Information collected over time, such as through your participation in the Programs, your activity on the online services, your device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude), your activity on unaffiliated third-party sites, mobile apps, or other online services, other marketing activities and Programs, and/or from third parties with whom we work. We and our Vendors, including without limitation Facebook, may use Tracking Technologies (as described under “Usage Information” above) to collect information for such marketing and evaluation purposes. For example, our Vendors may use the fact that you visited the Boston Market website to deliver ads to you on non-Boston Market websites, or they may use the fact that you used the Boston Market mobile app to deliver ads to you on non-Boston Market mobile apps. We and our Vendors may also identify whether our marketing activities and programs resulted in you engaging in other activities on our Services, our advertising and/or marketing, making purchases from us and/or our franchisees, visiting restaurants, or otherwise engaging with us. In addition, we and our Vendors may target Boston Market ads to you on your TV or other online services if we or our Vendor have identified you as a Boston Market customer using information we share with them, such as your name, email address, or mailing address.
You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. If you choose to opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements but they will not be tailored to your interests.
We and our Vendors may implement and evaluate our marketing activities and programs.
5. Third-Party Analytics and Targeted Advertising
Analytics
We partner with third-party Vendors to engage in analytics, analysis, auditing, measurement, research, and reporting, including without limitation based on Personal or Other Information collected over time, such as through your participation in the Programs, your activity on the online services, your device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude), and your activity on unaffiliated third-party sites, mobile apps, or other online services. Our Vendors may use web logs or pixel tags, and/or they may set and access cookies or other Tracking Technologies on your computer or other device. For example, we may use Facebook, Google Analytics, Google Analytics Advertising Features and/or other third party services to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes described in this Notice, including to evaluate our targeted marketing activities. Also see the “Targeted Marketing” section below. We may use this data in individual form, in a format that that does not, by itself, identify you individually and/or aggregated form, we may share information that does not, by itself, identify you individually and/or aggregated information and/or statistics with others outside of Boston Market, and we may allow third parties to collect and aggregate Other Information in connection with the use of Tracking Technologies. Your Personal information may also be used for analytics related to tracking your activities on the online services, for example, whether you participated in a Program, and which links within our online service you clicked on. You may opt out of the use of cookies by changing you browser settings.
Cross-Device Technologies
We and our Vendors may use collected information to establish connections among related web browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs) for targeted advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. We and/or our Vendors may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that your online behavior (information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device and your device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude)) may be combined with information collected from your other browsers or devices. For example, our Vendors may use this information to deliver an ad on your tablet or smartphone, to limit the number of times you see an ad across your devices, and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns across devices.
Location
We and/or our Vendors may collect the geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude) of your mobile device based upon information identified by your mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, beacons, Bluetooth and/or near field communication protocols. We may use and share your mobile device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude) together with Personal or Other Information to identify your local restaurant, to provide you with personalized messaging or content (for example, that you have a Rotisserie Rewards reward available) and/or for marketing purposes by email, push notification, online or in-app advertising, or by other means, as described in “Targeted Marketing” above and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Notice. See “Opt-Out Choices” below to opt-out of location collection. If you choose to opt-out of location collection, certain functionality of our Services may not be available.
Opt-Out Choices
You may opt out of certain of our or our Vendors’ targeted marketing practices in web browsers and mobile applications by following the instructions above in this Privacy Notice, or below. Please note that you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices, as each opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again. If you participate in any programs with, or receive services from, our franchisees or licensees, you will need to opt out of their systems separately. Note that some Vendors, franchisees or licensees may also make their own opt-out process available. Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising about Boston Market.
Web Browser Opt-Out. To opt out in web browsers, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at www.networkadvertising.org/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice page at www.aboutads.info/consumers.

If your Personal information has previously been shared with our Vendors or other third parties, any request to limit such sharing may not be effective with respect to such previously shared Personal Information.

For example, social media and TV providers may allow you to control your advertising preferences directly through their services. Please review the privacy policies of the third-party services you use for more information.
