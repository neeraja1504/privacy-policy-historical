3.2 Third Party Service Providers. BCMTouring may from time to time engage others to provide services to BCMTouring, to you and to other visitors to this Website. For example, BCMTouring may engage other companies to host, operate and maintain this Website, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, perform inventories or assessments and provide other services. BCMTouring will give them access to your personal information to the extent necessary to do their jobs. BCMTouring cannot guaranty that those companies will protect your personal information to the same extent described in this Privacy Policy.
3.3 Statistical Information. BCMTouring sells or otherwise shares some information about its visitors with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, that information is statistical in nature and does not identify specific individuals. For example, BCMTouring counts the number of visitors for purposes of managing its banner advertising business. BCMTouring uses that data to, among other things, customize content, services and advertising to better suit the needs of its visitors and customers.
3.4 Emails. From time to time, BCMTouring may send email messages to users. BCMTouring may use a bulk email service to distribute that information. If you do not want to receive bulk emails, please indicate that preference on your registration information or contact BCMTouring at [email protected]. Except for email messages that you send to BCMTouring or as provided in Section 6 titled “Your Participation in and Postings on Forums” of the Terms of Use, BCMTouring will not monitor, edit or disclose the contents of your email unless required in the course of normal maintenance of this Website and systems.
3.5 Cookies. Upon your first visit to this Website, our Website sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data. Cookies do not identify you by name. BCMTouring has two primary uses for its cookies. First, BCMTouring uses them to specify unique facts. Secondly, BCMTouring uses cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps BCMTouring better understand and improve this Website and its services. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this Website should have the option of disabling cookies through their browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some BCMTouring services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

4. Links to Other Websites. When you visit this Website, you could be directed to websites of Third Party Providers and to other websites that are beyond BCMTouring control. There are many links to other websites from this Website that may take you outside BCMTouring service. BCMTouring believes that this is one of the strengths of this Website. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement link or if you click on a Third Party Provider link, the "click" may take you from this Website to the website of that other person. Those other websites may not have privacy policies or may have privacy policies that are not as protective of your personal information as BCMTouring policy. These other websites may send their own cookies to visitors collect data or solicit personal information. BCMTouring strongly recommends that you review and understand the privacy policies of the websites you visit, whether you visit those websites directly or through a link from a page on this Website.
5. Forums. Whenever you give out personal information online, including via forums, message boards or chat groups, that information can be collected and used by others.
