Privacy policy - BCA Group
BCA's privacy policy is to respect and protect the privacy of visitors to the BCA web site and subscribers to any email updates from the web site. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. It will assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our services.
The data we collect
We do request personal information such as your name, email address, company details, etc which you can choose to provide when you complete and submit a web form on the BCA web site. We collect this information to help us more accurately respond to your enquiry. You are under no obligation to provide any personal data if you don't want to.Â  Information collected from the registration form on the BCA Digital Sales Guide is used to keep you informed on BCA sales and/or products and services, on which you have requested information.
We also use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our web site, new services and other information we think you will find valuable. If you choose to opt out of receiving any such communications from us, please email us at news@bca-group.comwith "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.
In the future BCA may decide to also collect aggregate information from all web site visitors. This aggregate data would only be used to customize BCA web content to deliver a better experience for our users and will in no way personally identify you.
Use of IP Address
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. On occasions, we collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to analyse aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site.
Use of Cookies
What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard you will find them at most major web sites.
By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed and this information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use cookies to better understand and improve areas of the BCA web site that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to the BCA web site always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the BCA web site may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.
Use of clear GIFs
A clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag (also known as a 'Web beacon') is a line of code placed on some of our web pages and/or in e-mails which, in a similar way to our use of cookies above, allow us to analyse the specific usage patterns of visitors.
Supplementary Information
We may acquire information about individuals from other sources and add such information to our house files.
Disclosure
We will not publish, give, sell or rent your information to anyone, ever. However, we reserve the right to disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) BCA's rights or property, other users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
Links to Other Sites/ "Public" Areas
You should be aware that when you are on the BCA web site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from BCA web site pages that take you outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may significantly differ from that of BCA. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.
Security
Protecting the security of all personally-identifiable information associated with our guests is of the utmost concern to us. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our users' personal information and maintain their privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of such personal information.
