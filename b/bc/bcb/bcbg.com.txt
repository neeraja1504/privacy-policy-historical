During the registration process on BCBG’s website, you are asked to provide certain information, such as your name, mailing address and/or zip code, country, email address, phone number, birth date or year and/or password. Providing this data about yourself is entirely voluntary, but enables you to derive more benefit from BCBG’s website.

Log Files
Like most standard website servers, we use and maintain the information that we obtain from and/or through your browser on our server logs. This information can include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP") and other data. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the website, detect fraud or other types of abuse and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may associate this information with your personally identifiable information to resolve technical issues, support security for our users and/or take action on any activity that may violate the Privacy Policy.
WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION
BCBG is able to collect your personal information when you use our websites. This can be done only when you voluntarily submit such information on our websites. We use such information to display contents and products that may be of interest to you and to personalize your online experience. From time to time we may share such information with our business affiliates and third parties. All third parties that we share personal information with are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We may also disclose your personal information under court orders or other legal requests.
Whenever you provide us personal information, you agree to BCBG using such data to deliver marketing material such as promotions, new merchandise or contests and sweepstakes to your email or physical mail address. If you choose not to receive such marketing material, you may explicitly opt out by doing so on our websites.
Your personal data collected by BCBG is used to:
Operate and improve BCBG’s website, services and offerings available through BCBG’s network
Personalize the content and advertisements provided to you
Communicate with you and respond to your inquiries
Share information with third parties, such information being covered by a nondisclosure agreement
Conduct research about your use of BCBG’s website
Help offer you other products or services that may be of interest
CONSENT TO BCBG PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
By providing data to us for the purposes of creating your account or adding any additional details to your BCBG profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms of the Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent to BCBG’s collection and processing of your data at any time, by changing your settings, or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.
BCBG COMMUNICATIONS
You can change your email and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing your settings related to your email notification choices.

AFFILIATES AND BUSINESS TRANSITIONS
BCBG may share your information with its affiliates that are subject to privacy policies that protect your personally identifiable information from disclosure to third parties in a manner similar to this Privacy Policy. In the event that BCBG (or its parent corporation) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of its assets, our users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Members may be notified of any such business transition via email and/or notice on BCBG’s website.
THIRD-PARTY OFFERS AND ADVERTISING
BCBG allows other companies, such as its marketing partners and affiliated companies, to offer their products and services to you, to register you on their websites, or to communicate with you about their products and services at a future date, through BCBG’s website or by email. Whether or not you decide to participate in such an offer is up to you.
As noted above, we may use your information to provide you with advertisements that are targeted to your specific needs and interests. These advertisements link directly to third-party websites. BCBG has no control over the content or privacy policies of such websites, and therefore we encourage you to review such content and policies prior to submitting any personal information to them. We share certain aggregate information, such as demographic information and the number of times its users have viewed an advertisement, with our third-party advertisers.
BCBG may allow certain companies to display advertisements on its website. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows such advertisers to recognize your computer each time it sends you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw its advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. BCBG may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your gender, age or zip code, with ad networks to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. BCBG does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and has no control over these parties' privacy policies or information-collection practices.
Google Analytics. Some or all of the BCBG Sites make use of Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. The BCBG Sites may also make use of other Google Analytics for Display Advertising features, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and/or the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration. We are required by Google to disclose the following information to you in our Privacy Statement in connection with our use of any Google Analytics for Display Advertising features on the BCBG Sites:
You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ads Settings page. You may also prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics by opting out through the use of the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
If the BCBG Sites make use of the Google Analytics for Display Advertising Remarketing feature, BCBG will use such Remarketing feature to advertise online and third party vendors, including Google, may show BCBG ads on sites across the Internet.
BCBG and third party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to (a) inform, optimize and serve ads based on a user’s past visits to the BCBG Sites, and/or (b) report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the BCBG Sites.
Data from Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting may be utilized by BCBG to help recognize and understand user preferences, to make improvements to the BCBG Sites, to choose content and advertising to display to you, and for other business purposes that will allow BCBG to better serve you.
