Statistical Data  – BCBST continually strives to enhance the features and services that are offered to our web site users.

For instance, we track the number of visits to a certain page; direct links from other web sites; and frequency of usage for independent services (i.e. claim status, application for coverage, etc). Questionnaires or surveys, during usage, are sometimes utilized to develop and improve the services offered. Although questionnaires and surveys assist BCBST in enhancing the services offered through our web site, we understand that not everyone is comfortable participating. Therefore, questionnaires and surveys are not mandatory for our users and allow the user to choose not to participate. We may share statistical data with our affiliates, brokers, and providers for marketing purposes and the improvement and promotion of our web site services. Although we reserve the right to share this information as indicated above, this statistical data, including questionnaires and surveys, does not contain any personal information that could disclose the user’s identity.

BCBST maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Spyware:
Spyware refers to types of software programs, downloaded to a consumer's personal computer either as a stand-alone application or as part of a software bundle, that collect (i) information about a consumer's internet activities or (ii) other personal information, without providing meaningful notice to the consumer or obtaining the consumer's consent. Spyware may gather personally identifiable information, such as e-mail addresses and credit card information, and may even alter personal computer settings. Spyware is often extremely difficult to remove once installed. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and forbids any employee, agent, partner, affiliate or contractor to deploy or use Spyware.
Direct Access to Other Sites:
BCBST offers direct links to other separate and individual web sites that offer information, which could be beneficial to our members. Since these direct links are separate web sites independent of bcbst.com, they may not follow the same privacy guidelines set forth here.

We suggest that you contact the appropriate controlling authorities of these sites or review their privacy policy.

Security
BCBST takes precautions to protect its users’ personal non-public information. When users submit sensitive information to BCBST, the information is protected both online and off-line.
When the registration/login form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software, specifically SSL 3.0, RC4 with 128 bit encryption (High) which may be updated from time to time. While on a secure page, such as the login page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘‘surfing’’.
While BCBST uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, BCBST protects user-information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform their jobs are granted access to personally identifiable information. BCBST employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on BCBST security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
BCBST Reserves The Right To Modify Its Privacy Policy
BCBST reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes made to our privacy policy will be posted on this site in a manner that is easily identifiable. Please review our privacy policy on a regular basis to review any changes.
