Bellacor may use cookies to help provide a fast, convenient shopping experience. A cookie is a data element a website sends to a browser. It is stored on a computer hard drive and tells a website that a previous visitor has returned. It doesn't automatically give personal information.
If users want to provide personal information through registration a cookie will help deliver content based on user interests and preferences. Cookies help Bellacor monitor whether websites are functioning properly and to perform site traffic analysis.

Encryption is a process by which Bellacor uses software to scramble sensitive information while it is in transit to Bellacor.com. Bellacor uses Secure Socket Layering (SSL). SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. It is based on a key that has two different parts: public and private.
The public part of the key is distributed to those users want to communicate with. The private part is for recipients' use only. When users send personal information the Bellacor public key is used to encrypt personal information. If user information is intercepted during the transmission it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once Bellacor receives encrypted personal information the private part of the key is used to decode it.
Making a credit card purchase online at Bellacor.com is as safe as making a credit card purchase over the telephone. If users prefer to use the phone call 1-877-723-5522 to place an order.
