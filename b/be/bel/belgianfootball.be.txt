Acceptance
By the simple fact of visiting the website of URBSFA, you acknowledge and accept the privacy policy set out below, which implies in particular that you authorize URBSFA to process the personal data which you transmit to it over this website, for example in online forms, e-mail messages sent to the e-mail addresses of URBSFA and/or its divisions, Voetbal Federatie Vlaanderen (VFV) and Association des Clubs Francophones de Football (ACFF), cookies, entries in games and competitions, etc.
URBSFA may change the content of this document at any time according to changes in the services it offers or the way in which it operates its website. We therefore advise you to visit this page regularly to see any changes that are made.
Processing of personal data
Our website may be visited freely or after registering, which gives the visitor access to personalized services.
When you register on our website, you will be asked to supply various personal details (user name, e-mail address, name and first name, date of birth, address, etc).
This information is stored in a database. With your permission, URBSFA may use this information to send you its newsletter, give you details about the services provided by its partners, or for marketing purposes. URBSFA may transmit these data to third parties in the context of contractual relations between URBSFA and those third parties, insofar as the transmission of those data is expressly provided for.
Once you are registered on our website, you may create a personalized page using various tools that are proposed (installation of blocks containing your favourite information). Details of your preferences are recorded for the sole purpose of allowing you to create and use your personalized page and may not be processed for other purposes.
Several options are shown on the page where you can register:
The first allows you to receive our newsletter
The second allows you to receive information about the partners of URBSFA
The third option is where you give your consent to use your personal details for commercial purposes
You may change your profile at any time on the relevant page and modify your preferences.
When you contact us using an online contact form or an e-mail address of URBSFA, VFV or ACFF, you send us personal data (e-mail address, telephone number, etc).
Those data are not stored in a database and are used by our staff for the sole purpose of answering your queries.
When you enter for a game or competition on our website , the personal data which you transmit to us are used exclusively for the purposes of this game or competition. They may be communicated to third parties in the context of their contractual relations with URBSFA insofar as they concern the organization – in the broadest sense of the word – of the game or competition.
Data processing declaration
URBSFA has filed several data processing declarations with the Privacy Commission for the databases which it manages. Those declarations may be consulted at www.privacycommission.be.
Data storage
The data are stored on the servers of URBSFA for as long as is necessary to provide the services offered. Registered users who wish to deregister may request this by using the contact form under the section “Website”. Once this request is processed, all personal data are destroyed.
Personal data that are supplied to us when you enter for a game or competition are stored for as long as is required for the purposes of the game or competition and afterwards for as long as is required to verify the terms and conditions of the competition if necessary (for example in case of legal action). For this purpose, please consult the terms and conditions of games and competitions.
Data security
We implement the necessary security measures to protect the data which you entrust to us. Nevertheless, the process of transmitting data over the Internet is not entirely without risk. Personal data may be intercepted or diverted over the Internet without our knowledge. In using our website, you acknowledge that you are perfectly aware of the risks connected with the Internet and that you accept those risks.
You should also bear in mind that the data that are transmitted over the Internet from and to our website are not encrypted.
We advise the utmost caution when using the Internet. In this respect, we wish to point out that you are asked to give personal information only for the purposes of the registration procedure and on the web page reserved to this end. You will never be asked to supply or confirm such data by e-mail or any other means of communication. We also advise you not to use links that are contained in e-mail messages and that direct you to pages where you are asked to provide personal data.
Finally, we should also point out that it is your responsibility to take appropriate security measures to protect you against intrusion (installation of a regularly updated antivirus program, firewall, etc).
Protection of minors
The legal representatives of minors are asked to supervise their use of the Internet. It is their responsibility to restrict access to various sites or services of which they consider the content and/or use inappropriate.
In its concern to protect underage children, URBSFA will not use for commercial purposes personal data of minors that were communicated to it during the registration procedure on its website, even if it was authorized to do so during registration or by a change in the user’s profile page.
