Cookies and similar tracking technology
We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “ Cookies ”) to collect and use personal information about you when you visit our Website. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Policy, available at https://www.belgraviacentre.com/cookie-policy/.
How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.
Where do we store your personal information?
The Belgravia Centre stores data on its own secure internal servers. We also use services hosted by third parties for the purpose of backup. These backup servers are currently located within the UK and the third parties have no access to your data other for backup and retrieval purposes.
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
When you pay via our portal, your transactions will be completed by one of our partners, such as Stripe or WorldPay. The Belgravia Centre will limit the use of your Personal Data by our partners, vendors and suppliers according to this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. When using a payment method through the third-party mechanism offered via the portal, the information you choose to share with that third-party will be treated in accordance to that third-party’s privacy policy.
However, we will endeavour to take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
How long do we keep your personal information?
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us.
• Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
