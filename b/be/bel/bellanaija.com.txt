Privacy Policy and Terms of Use | BellaNaija
BellaNaija together with its affiliate entities ( BellaNaija Weddings and BellaNaija Style ) takes your privacy seriously hence the updates we have made to our privacy policy to make it GDPR complaint and to serve you better. We may update our policy regularly, so we advise you to take out time to go through this policy and understand what your rights are.
What’s in this policy?
This policy tells you:
What information we might collect about you
How we might use that information
When we might use your details to contact you
What information of yours we might share with others
Your choices about the personal information you give us
What does this policy cover?
This policy covers the services that are offered by BellaNaija. And sometimes it covers services offered by parts of our organisation that operate as separate companies. Such as: BellaNaija Weddings, BellaNaija Style,  BellaNaija.com and social media pages.
What’s not covered in this policy?
Our services sometimes link to services run by other companies. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours.
How do you protect my personal information?
We’re strongly committed to keeping you and your family’s information safe. And to do this we design our services with your safety in mind. We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.
At the same time, no service can be completely secure – if you have any concerns that your personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please get in touch straight away.
Where we store your information
Some companies that provide services to us run their services from outside Nigeria/the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be transferred, stored or processed in a location outside Nigeria/Africa/the EEA.

We’ll give details about why we need your personal information and how we’ll use it before you begin, unless it’s obvious.
Information that you give to us
We might ask for your name and contact details or your date of birth, depending on what you’re doing. If you apply to take part in a programme on politics, for example, we might ask you about your political opinions. This could include information in a creation you share with us such as people’s names that appear in the creation.

How long will BellaNaija keep my personal information?
When you give us any personal information we’ll let you know how long we’ll hold it for. And always stick to these principles:
We only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a valid reason to keep it.
We think about what type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements.
We design our services so that we don’t hold your information any longer than we have to
We may close your BellaNaija account if you haven’t used it in the last year. We’ll send you an email to tell you that we plan to do this before we delete anything, so please check to see if we’ve sent you any emails about this.
How can BellaNaija use my personal information?
We have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. It’s called the “ lawful basis for processing “. Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like  when you subscribe to an email. Other times, when you’d reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don’t ask your permission, but only when:
The law says it’s fine to use it, and
It fits with the  rights you have.
We use your information for these types of things:
To deliver our services and to provide you with information about the.
b. To deal with your requests, complaints and enquiries.
c. To personalise services and give you things more tailored to your tastes

Some of this advertising might be  tailored to you.

Will my personal information be used when BellaNaija advertises with other companies?
If you have a  BellaNaija account  we might use information that we hold about you to show you relevant and  “targeted advertising”  through other companies’ sites, like Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Twitter for example. This could be showing you a BellaNaija advertising message where we know you have a BellaNaija account and have used BellaNaija services.
If you don’t want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies’ settings. Also, you can visit your BellaNaija account and  turn off personalisation , but it will also turn off all  personalised services.

We’ll never sell your personal information. We do share it with others in these ways:
When you make something public
Like  post a comment  which the public can see.
When we use other companies to power our services
In order for us to give you quality experiences and to understand how you’re using our services we often use other companies to process your personal information on our behalf. For example, sending you emails about things we think might interest you, or to ask you what you think about our services.
We make sure that  your personal information  is looked after as if we were handling it directly. We carefully select these companies, only share with them what they need to do the work and we make sure they **  keep your information secure**.
When we share personal information with  ** companies in the BellaNaija family**
When you  ** use another company’s service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices**
To access our services through a voice-enabled device, like Amazon Alexa, you need to connect your device to your  BellaNaija account. We’ll share an identifier for your BellaNaija account with the voice service. It’s completely up to you if you want to use the BellaNaija in this way.
When we do collaborative research
We do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our  content  and data with them. This might include information we’ve collected about you. But we’re careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.
Sometimes by law we have to pass on your information to other organisations
We might also share your information if we have to by law, or when we need to protect you or other people from harm.
What’s different for kids and teens?
BellaNaija has services that are kid-friendly and for teens. Here’s what happens when you use them.
Why do we collect information about you in the first place?
We keep information about you so that we can:
Get the right services for you
Plan and improve our services
Keep in touch with you
We’ll always tell you why we’re collecting your personal information
We’ll explain why and how we use it and for how long. It’s called a “privacy notice”. And if we need your parent or guardian’s permission we’ll give you clear details about what’s needed at the time.
We can only use your personal information  ** if we have a valid reason**
We share personal information about you to others but we  ** follow some rules**
The main rule is we never sell your personal information to anyone.
We might ask you to tell us your age
To make sure you use parts of BellaNaija that are suitable for you. For example:
So that adults don’t  post comments  on kid’s message boards
when you want to  get a BELLA NAIJA account
Sometimes we’ll ask to get your parent or guardian’s consent
You’ll see a notification. We might also ask for some details from them, so that we can contact them. Other times we may contact your parent or guardian:
So you can  get notifications  from us
So we can  show you more things we think you’ll like , based on what you do
So you can post comments
So you can upload your contributions to us
Sometimes we’ll tell your parents about your activities
For example, if you’re under 13 and your parent has asked to see every  creation  you upload, we’ll share it with them before it goes public.
When we contact you
Sometimes we’ll need to get in touch with you but we’ll always follow  these rules.
It’s safe to use us
It’s our job to  keep your personal information safe and secure. That’s why we design our services with your safety in mind. And we’re always looking for the best ways to improve this.
There are also things  that you can do to keep safe , like  thinking about what information you share  and how to keep your devices secure.
