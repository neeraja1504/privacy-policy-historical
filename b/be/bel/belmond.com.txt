improve our products and services and to ensure our products and services are of interest to you.
Even where Belmond has a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, it will not do so to the extent that processing would override your interests, rights and freedoms to protect your personal data.
We may also use your personal data to protect against and prevent fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce applicable legal requirements, industry standards, and our policies and terms. We use personal data for these purposes when it is necessary to protect, exercise or defend our legal rights, or when we are required to do so by applicable law.

Your decision to provide personal data (including special category/sensitive personal data) to us is voluntary, however, if you do not provide such personal data you may no longer be able to benefit from our services.
