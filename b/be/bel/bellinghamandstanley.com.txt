ARE COOKIES USED ON XYLEM SITES?
In addition to a domain name and/or IP address, Xylem collects information about you automatically when you visit our Sites.  The information that is automatically collected does not include your name, address, telephone number, or email address. This information tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages they have accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Sites for our current and future visitors. To collect this information, we use a number of different analytics, media optimization tools, analytics tags and pixel tracking activity through 'cookie' technology or with 'web beacons,' as explained below:
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard drive by your web browser when you first visit the Site.  Xylem uses cookies to both ensure functioning of the site as well as record user-specific information on what pages you visited as well as record past activities on our site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site.  There are two kinds of cookies that Xylem uses:
Session Cookies - also called a transient cookie, a session cookie stores information about a user on its temporary memory so that it can remember something about you when you are visiting that site.  Session cookies do not collect information from your computer and are erased when you close your Web browser.
Persistent Cookies - Also called a permanent cookie, or a stored cookie, a persistent cookie collects identifying information about the user including web-surfing behavior and user preferences for a specific website.  Persistent cookies are set with an expiration date and stored on your hard drive until it expires or until you delete from your computer.
In some instances, cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  Most Internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can change the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance altogether if you prefer.  Please be advised that if you choose to not allow browser cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all the website features offered by Xylem.
Web Beacons

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluation activity, compiling website reports and providing other services relating to website activity usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
The information collected by all cookies and web beacons includes general information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet, the operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings of browsing on the site and geographical location.
