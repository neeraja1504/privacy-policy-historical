Personal Information. Bellashoot collects personal information only if you voluntarily choose to share such information with Bellashoot. You may browse the Site without disclosing any personal information. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Service, we may require that you furnish personal information. When you register your account, sign up for newsletters, complete forms for optional programs, surveys, contests and other entries, and through communications transmitted through Bellashoot, applications and your use of the Bellashoot mobile application, we may collect information including your name, email address, phone number, date of birth and gender. You also may choose to send Bellashoot personally identifying information in an email message containing information or inquiries about the Service.
Anonymous or Aggregated Data. Bellashoot collects and stores certain data about the use of the Service on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. Such information may include pages viewed and search terms entered on the Site. Bellashoot does not link this information to anything personally identifiable to you.
Cookies and Other Technologies. When you visit websites on the Internet, your browser may automatically transmit information to the websites you visit throughout every visit. Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may utilize persistent cookies that only Bellashoot can read and use to save your login information for future logins to the Service, to hold session information, and to track user preferences. We may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Service, to track the number of entries in Bellashoot promotions, sweepstakes and contests and to identify visited areas of the Site and Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Service. We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with the Service and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” to collect anonymous information about your visits to this Site and to other websites, and they may use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner that does not personally identify you.

We collect and store certain types of system log data whenever you interact with the Service, including search terms, pages viewed, the IP address, the browser brand and version, what device is being used and the operating system of the device. We collect logged data to better understand which devices are using the Service and their performance levels in order to continually optimize our software and Services to provide the most efficient and stable service to Users.

When you visit and interact with the Site, Bellashoot and/or third parties with whom Bellashoot has contracted to provide services to Bellashoot may collect your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”), which is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use IP Addresses to monitor the regions from which Users navigate the Site and for fraud prevention purposes.

Bellashoot's Use of Personal Information
Bellashoot uses Personal Information for the following general purposes:
to provide the Service,
for identification and authentication, and fraud prevention,
to analyze Site usage and improve the Service,
to contact you and deliver administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Service,
for internal market research, troubleshooting problems, and detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity,
for distribution to third-party contractors that provide services to Bellashoot and partners of Bellashoot who are bound by privacy restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Policy,
to enforce our Terms of Use, and
as otherwise set forth in the Policy.
Although we ensure that our third party agents (“Agents”) receiving your information are bound by privacy restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this policy, Bellashoot is not responsible for any issues that may arise regarding the Privacy Policies of any of its affiliates or advertiser. By using this website, you do hereby agree to hold Bellashoot harmless from any claims and/or damages that may arise from the actions of any of its affiliates and/or advertisers.
Two things drive Bellashoot's decisions regarding the use of information collected from Users: 1) improving user experience by offering personalized services, content and advertising, and 2) market research.
Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and Bellashoot believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. Bellashoot may use Cookies and other Technologies and Personal Information to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them.
In addition to banner ads, Bellashoot may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide.
Bellashoot may use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. In connection with this advertising, we, along with third-party business partners, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to allow our third-party business partners, including Google, ad servers, and ad networks, to serve you advertisements (“ads”) based on your prior visits to our Service. These ads are delivered to you on third-party websites and services across the Internet. These third-party business partners use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on third-party sites, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. Along with cookies, they may also use other technologies (such as JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to optimize and personalize the advertising content. Bellashoot does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party business partners for such parties’ own marketing purposes. You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page. Google has additional information available about their Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions.
Bellashoot may analyze Personal Information and Web Navigational Data based on your interests and may use the analysis from this information in a way that doesn’t reveal a User’s personal information (“Market Research”) in order to: * Market the Service * Improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of Users * Increase the likelihood that a group's experience with the Service is relevant to its interests as a whole
Bellashoot uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to Users who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Research.
