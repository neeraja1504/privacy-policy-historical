Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we may or may not identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
We will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us (user experience optimization, etc.) and for other ancillary purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used.
We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information, including principally updates to the Privacy Policy.
We will only retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
