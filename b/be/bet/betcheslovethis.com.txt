Log Files and Web Beacons Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. These include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.
For your safety, we do not link IP addresses to personal information unless we notify you or unless necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of our website. In general the use of log files is simply to monitor traffic on our website and in the event necessary, troubleshoot technical problems. Please note that in the event of an abuse by a user of our website we may block certain IP addresses. In addition to cookies and log files we do at times use a common internet technology called “web beacons”. These are small graphic images placed on a web page, web based document, or an email address that is designed specifically to allow us or our third parties vendors to collect certain information and monitor use activity on our website. Please note these are invisible to the user because they are typically very small. In furtherance of our Privacy Policy please note we do not use web beacons to collect the personal information about you. We may use them to collect non-personal information such as IP addresses of the computer that the web beacon said to, the URL of the page where the web user comes from and the time the web beacon is activated.
