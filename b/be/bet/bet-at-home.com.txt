Right to object: If your data is processed in order to take on tasks of public interest or to exercise public authority or if we refer to the necessity of processing the data to maintain our legitimate interest, you can object to the processing of your data if the protection of your data outweighs our legitimate interest. You can also revoke any agreements to bet-at-home.com collecting and saving your personal data at any time as long as there is no opposing contractual or legal obligation.
Right to complain: If you believe that we are violating European data protection law when processing your data, we would ask you to contact us in order to clarify any questions you may have. It is of course also within your right to complain to a regulating authority within the EU.

7. Storage of personal data
Customer data is transmitted, stored, and processed electronically. All information you provide to us is saved on the servers of bet-at-home.com and only trained and authorised persons, who are bound to treat personal data confidentially and in accordance with the current date protection regulation, have access to it. The customer undertakes to keep passwords which provide him/her access to certain areas a secret.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. We take all possible steps to protect the personal data of customers. However, complete security of customers’ data can never be guaranteed. Therefore, all transfer of data by the customer is at their own risk. After bet-at-home.com has received the data, the company takes technical and organisational measures to ensure that bet-at-home.com’s systems are protected against attacks and misuse, and that the user’s personal data is protected against loss, incorrect modification, and unauthorised use by third parties.
By default, bet-at-home.com’s apps save the customer’s username. The customer can change this at any time in the settings of the relevant app.

We use cookies and similar technologies so that our website design is clearer, safer, and more personal. Cookies enable bet-at-home.com to be able to offer services, to improve the security of the website, to collect information regarding transactions, and to prevent fraud. Furthermore, cookies simplify navigation and facilitate the management of the insertion of particularly relevant or useful information or adverts.
Cookies are small files which are stored on the device of the user to which the browser or the respective app that is used is assigned and through which the party placing the cookie receives certain information.
