How BetterPhoto Came Into Being
Early in 1996, Jim Miotke, the President and Founder of BetterPhoto.com, got inspired to explore Web publishing, when a friend shared her experiences creating an online college thesis. Seeing the power of online publishing, Jim became inspired, diving whole-heartedly into Web development. He listened to the wisdom: "Write about what you love" and, since he had a passion for photography, Jim published a brief article - his Top Ten Photography Tips on photography. The rest is history. This short article served to launch what was to become the premier educational Web site on photography.
