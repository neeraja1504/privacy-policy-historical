We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
6.1.   Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
6.1.1 We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.

6.1.3 Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
6.2.   Please contact us at help@betvictor.com, marked for the attention of the Data Protection Officer, if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
7.1.   We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
7.2.   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8.1.   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
8.2.   To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. By law we have to keep basic information about our customers after they cease being customers as follows:
Type of data
|
Retention period
---|---
Personal data
|
5 years, save for where a customer has self-excluded from the Website, in which case we are required to retain the personal data for seven (07) years from the end of the self-exclusion period, at which point the five (05) year retention period begins. In addition, we retain personal data for longer where required for a legal investigation or litigation.
Financial data
|
7 years
8.3 .  In some circumstances, you may ask us to anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you). For further information about this right, please refer to Right to Erasure below.
9.1. Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as set out below.
9.2.  Right of Access
Under Article 12 and 15 and Recital 63 of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data that we hold about you.
This request is free and we will respond to your request within one (01) month, unless the request is particularly complicated, but we will tell you.
In order to fulfil your request, you will need to email help@betvictor.com , marked for the attention of the Data Protection Officer. Make sure you define a timeframe that you would like your information from (otherwise our default period is two (02) years), as well as what data you would like:
Identity Data
Contact Data
Profile Data
Financial Data
Transaction Data
Marketing and Communications Data
Technical Data
9.3.  Right of Accuracy
Under Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to update (or request that we update) any of the Personal Data that we hold about you if it has changed.
The easiest way to do this is to log into your account and go to “My Account” and then “Settings”.
If you can’t update some information because it is greyed out or not there, you will need to contact us by emailing help@betvictor.com from the email address registered on your account.  We will then update your personal details and notify you when that has been completed.
9.4.  Right of Erasure
Under Article 17 and Recitals 65 and 66 of the GDPR, you have the right to request that any Personal Data that we hold about you is erased once it is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected.
As standard we anonymise some Personal Data after five (05) years from your last transaction, unless we have to keep it to fulfil our legal requirements (Data Retention Period).
If you think we have your Personal Data and the 5-year Data Retention Period has passed, please contact us by emailing help@betvictor.com, marked for the attention of the Data Protection Officer and we will look into it for you.
9.5.  Right to Data Portability
Under Article 21 and Recitals 68, 69 and 70 of the GDPR, you have the right to request that we transfer a copy of your Personal Data to another company.
This would most often be used in industries like insurance or utilities when you are switching providers, and at this time, is not an option for the online gaming industry. However, it is a longer-term objective for us and our privacy notice will be updated and amended accordingly as and when an agreed model can be implemented.
Note that the portability right does not extend to personal data which is inferred or derived by the data controller (for example, the results of an algorithmic analysis of an individual’s behaviour).
9.6.  Right to Withdraw Consent
Under Article 7 of the GDPR, you have the right to withdraw your consent of the processing of your Personal Data on your account for marketing purposes.
At any time, you can amend your marketing preferences by:
Going to “My Account” and then “Settings”
Clicking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any marketing emails
Contacting us by emailing help@BetVictor.com , or going onto Live Chat; or
Putting your request in writing and sending it to: Opt Out Requests, Betvictor, Suite 2.01, World Trade Center, Bayside Road, Gibraltar, GX11 1AA
9.7.  Right to Object to Processing
Under Article 21 and Recitals 69 and 70 of the GDPR , if a fully automated decision is made on your account, you have the right to request that this decision is reviewed by a person and present any evidence that you believe may make your situation unique.
You can request a review of such a decision made on your account by emailing help@BetVictor.com
9.8.  Right to request the restriction of processing
Under Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to request that we stop processing your data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
You can make this request by emailing help@BetVictor.com, marked for the attention of the Data Protection Officer.
9.9.  Further information
If you would like any further information about the rights set out above, please contact us help@betvictor.com , marked for the attention of the Data Protection Officer.
9.10.  Fee
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
9.11.  What we will need from you
We will request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
9.12.   Time limit to respond
Save as specifically noted above, we try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (01) month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Object to processing

You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
Request access
|
To your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request ). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
Request correction
|
Of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us; and
Request erasure
|
Of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons;
Request restriction of processing
|
Of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
Request the transfer
|
Of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you; and
Withdraw consent at any time
|
Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
