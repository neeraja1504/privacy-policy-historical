As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization, to our third party partners or among our affiliates within the United States.

(b) NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION. When you visit and interact on the Site or Services, certain information is collected automatically, including:
Non-Identifying Information: We collect other non-identifying information you provide when you visit the Site or use the Services. (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other BetterDoctor clients to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site and Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
Log Data: When you visit the Site and Service, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user (any of these, a “BetterDoctor User”), our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Service, pages of our Site and Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site and Service’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Service to our visitors’ needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
(c) COOKIES. Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Service. Second, we may utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Service and to monitor aggregate usage by BetterDoctor Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site or Service and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.
(d) WEB BEACONS. Our Site and Service may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Service are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of User communications and marketing campaigns.
(e) LOCATION. We may collect and store information about your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.
We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We may share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We may also share your Contact Data, Demographic Data, Insurance Data and other Content via BetterDoctor API. We also share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services and/or by making certain interactive tools available to our users. Those business partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to BetterDoctor.
We do not rent, share, sell or trade Personal Contact Information (e.g. Email) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. That said, we work with third parties and they may have access to some of your information:
(A) ANALYTICS SERVICES. We may use third party analytics services in connection with the Services. For example, we may use services to record mouse clicks, mouse movements, recording calls, scrolling activity, as well as any text that you type into the Services (collectively, “Traffic Data”). These analytics services will not collect Personal Information that you do not voluntarily enter. These services will not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services. We are using the information collected from these services to find usability problems to make the Services easier to use. Should we decide to use any third party analytics services that track or collect Personal Information, we will provide you with advance notice.
(B) DEVELOPERS. We make our API available to developers to create medical provider data products. By registering with BetterDoctor and/or using our Doctor self-verification services you give us permission to share your contact information with third party developers.
(C) HEALTH PLANS. Health Plans use our Services to validate, update and otherwise manage their medical provider data. By registering with BetterDoctor and/or using our Doctor self-verification services you give us permission to share your contact information with health plans, insurance carriers and other third parties that have an interest in the management of medical provider data.
(D) OUTSOURCING. We outsource some of our technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing functions, and other services to third parties. We may share information from or about you with them so that they can perform their services.
3. INFORMATION REQUIRED/USED FOR ACCOUNT CREATION
Using the Services offered on the Site requires the registering with the Service and creating an account. We may store the information you submit to the Service in the creation of an account, or through your use of the Services. We use the information to fulfill your requests, provide Service functionality, improve Service quality, personalize your experience, display relevant advertising, provide customer support, send messages to you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, and comply with legal obligations. Among the information you submit to or through the Services, please note:
3.1 ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
You must provide a valid email address in order to sign up for an account through the Services. In addition, you may provide us with your (1) full name, (2) phone number, (3) address, and (4) insurance data (such as insurance carrier and insurance plan). When you sign up for a BetterDoctor account, we opt you in to receive emails from BetterDoctor by default. Note that you cannot opt out of receiving required administrative or legal notices. If you feel that an unauthorized account has been created depicting you or your likeness, you can request its removal by sending email to privacy@betterdoctor.com.
3.2 ACCESSING BETTERDOCTOR VIA THIRD PARTY SERVICE
You can also sign up by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers (e.g. Doximity, henceforth “Third Party Service”); each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via our Services as described below. As part of the functionality of the Services, you may link your BetterDoctor Account with Third Party Accounts, by allowing BetterDoctor to access your Third Party Account, to the extent permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. If you chose to login through a Third Party Account, the login process will be governed by the terms and conditions imposed by the applicable Third Party Service.
You can connect your BetterDoctor account to Third Party Accounts, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the Third Party Account. We use the information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers. We may use the information to pre-populate your account registration information or identify others you may know or wish to invite to join the Services.
You represent that you are entitled to grant BetterDoctor access to your Third Party Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating BetterDoctor to pay any fees or making BetterDoctor subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable Third Party Service. If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Services, we may obtain the personal information you have provided to the applicable Third Party Services. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we may also have access to the information in your Third Party Accounts. To the extent permitted by your Third Party Account settings, BetterDoctor may pre-populate your BetterDoctor registration with Content from your Third Party Account. For example, if you choose to login to BetterDoctor through Doximity, the login authentication occurs between you and Doximity; BetterDoctor may obtain any information that you have authorized Doximity to provide. Please review Third Party Service terms before using these shared login services. Such Third Party Service may have different terms of use and different protections for your content and personal information.
4. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. If we materially change the ways in which we use and disclose personal data, we will update the Effective Date at the top of this page, and send a notification email to our registered users. Your continued use of the Service following any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.
5. CHILDREN & MINORS
Company’s Site and corresponding Services are not intended for, or designed to attract, any individuals under the age of 18. BetterDoctor does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from ANY person we actually know is an individual under the age of 18, regardless of parental consent. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from an individual under the age of 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
6. ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION
As a registered User of the Services, you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile or change your username by logging in and accessing your account. Upon your request, BetterDoctor will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your account and the Personal Information in your profile; however, it may be impossible to remove your account without some residual information being retained by BetterDoctor. When you delete your account, you understand that removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
For example, while we will remove your account profile and the ability for others to contact you through the Services or access your Personal Information, some of your information may be retained in the individual pages for health care providers as a result of data validation and data verification services performed for and/or with third parties. Such information may be in aggregate form, such as data pertaining to a particular health care provider’s services’ availability with a particular health plan or insurance policy.
Registered users who wish to close their account should request removal by sending email to privacy@betterdoctor.com.
7. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST
Company reserves the right to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses. Any such reorganization may result in Company sharing and/or disclosing your Personal Information to prospective or actual successors-in-interest and their advisors, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisors. Buy using this Site and its Services, you acknowledge and agree that such transfers of Personal Information may occur, and that any acquirer of BetterDoctor is entitled to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
8. MESSAGING
If we incorporate, messaging into the Services, and you exchange messages with others through the Services, we may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them. Many communications you initiate through BetterDoctor (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and name in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you’re directly connected. If you send information from the Services to your phone via SMS text message, we may log your phone number, phone carrier, and the date and time that the message was processed. We will not charge you for sending information to your phone, but carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive.
9. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: HIPAA
Health care providers, their employees, and their agents should be particularly aware of their obligations of patient confidentiality, including without limitation their obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), both in communicating with BetterDoctor and in responding to a review of their services posted through our Services. BetterDoctor does not have, and will not accept, any obligations of confidentiality with respect to any communications other than those expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and BetterDoctor’s Terms of Use.
10. SECURITY
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information through our Services, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.
If you have any comments, concerns or questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@betterdoctor.com.
