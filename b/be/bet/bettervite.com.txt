Security
We take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. Your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.

You agree that your use of Bettervite Site, after the date on which the Privacy Policy is changed, will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy, and that you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
