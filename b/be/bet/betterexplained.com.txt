Privacy Policy – BetterExplained
This website does not collect personal information. Here’s a quick summary of behavior:
No personal information is collected. If you leave a blog comment and include an email, this is stored inside the WordPress comment database but not exposed. This email can be used to notify you if you’ve subscribed to new comments.
User information is never shared with any third parties.
Email newsletters are opt-in, with 1-click unsubscribe.
All product purchases occur offsite (on Gumroad or Paypal) and payment information is not submitted directly to this website.
Web analytics and ad retargeting services are used, including Google Analytics, StatCounter, Clicky, Visual Website Optimizer, and AdRoll. These services typically rely on 3rd-party cookies, and can be globally disabled in your browser settings.
