4. Disclosure of Your Information
Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us, and therefore, we do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Better World Books may share your personal information with the following:
Third party providers of products and services you order: If you buy a product on the Sites that is fulfilled by a third party, we share your personal information with that third party for the purpose of fulfilling your order. Examples of this include, but may not be limited to, marketplace orders (orders of books listed on the Sites and fulfilled by independent booksellers) and new book orders (which may be fulfilled directly by a wholesaler).
Other entities owned by Better World Books: We manage or may manage in the future other web sites owned by Better World Books. We may share your personal information within Better World Books and/or its affiliated entities (if any) in order to provide you a better experience on all of our web sites.
Service providers, subcontractors and agents who perform services on our behalf: We provide personal information to third party service providers, subcontractors, and agents that work under contract on our behalf to provide certain services. These third parties do not have the right to use the personal information we provide to them in any way that is not authorized by us. They are contractually obligated to use such information only as necessary to assist us and to maintain the confidentiality and security of such information.
Credit Card Companies: Credit card transactions are handled by third party financial institutions and their vendors and contractors who receive credit card numbers and other personal information from us to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.
Protection of Better World Books and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Better World Books, our users, or other third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this disclosure does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personal information for commercial purposes.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or other business units. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets, but such information remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless you otherwise agree). Also, in the event that Better World Books or substantially all of its assets are acquired, personal information will be included amongst the transferred assets to the acquirer in such transaction. In addition, if Better World Books becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, personal information may be provided to the entities and advisors involved in such transaction.
5. Email from Better World Books
It is possible for you to use much of our Sites without giving us any personal information. When you register with us or give us personal information, you will have an opportunity to limit promotional e-mail communications from Better World Books. You can request at any time that Better World Books not send future e-mails to you by unsubscribing from the communication through links contained therein (typically in the footer of the e-mail). If you require further assistance, you may contact us at help@BetterWorldBooks.com. Please note that such requests do not include e-mail of a purely administrative nature (i.e., you cannot opt out of receiving order confirmations, shipping confirmations, or arrival confirmations). They do, however, include opting out of special offers and newsletters.
6. Communications with Others
The Sites may allow you to contribute to one or more blogs or communicate by means of online functions; provided, that you supply your name and email address. Better World Books is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to communicate or exchange using the functionality of the Sites.
Each item of information or any materials you contribute for such purposes are your "Public Content." Public Content must be content and information that you have a right to disclose and transfer and must not violate any other personâ€™s privacy or intellectual property rights.
7. Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
Our Sites is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information through our Sites. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on our Sites or on or through any of its features. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13; however, if we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. Please contact us if you believe we might have personal information about a child under age 13.
8. Limitation of Liability
By providing us with any personal information you expressly and unconditionally release and hold harmless Better World Books and its shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, trustees, governors, employees, volunteers and agents (collectively, the "Releasees") from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected personal information, to the extent permitted by law. In addition, while Better World Books makes efforts to ensure the proper and appropriate use of data provided by Better World Books to third-party companies, promotional partners or vendors, the Releasees are not liable for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected personal information by such third parties.
9. Notification of Changes and Acceptance of this Privacy Policy
By using our Sites, you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy Policy. Better World Books may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, any such changes will be posted on this Privacy Policy, so that Better World Books may keep its users informed of its information collection practices. Accordingly, we recommend that you consult this Privacy Policy frequently so that you are aware of our latest privacy policy and/or any changes to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Sites shall constitute your acceptance of any such new or revised Privacy Policy. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will send such person an email notifying him/her of such changes and giving him/her the option as to whether to allow us to use such information in such different manner. Without such consent, we will use personal information in accordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected.
10. Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. When a Siteâ€™s registration/order form asks users to enter financial information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted during transmission through the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software. You should see the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla FireFox, Google Chrome, etc.) become locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just surfing.
11. Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information
You may request access to, correction or destruction of any personal information that you have provided to us to the extent that any such request would not violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
