What is Personal Information?
“Personal Information” is information about a particular individual that specifically identifies that individual, or information about that individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit or debit card information.

Children. The Sites are not directed at children and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children (including information concerning a child or that child’s parents/guardians, any screen or user name that functions as online contact information for a child, any photograph, video, or audio file containing a child’s image or voice) directly from users under the age of thirteen (13) or from other web sites or services directed at children. Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (“ COPPA ”), we will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any child under the age of thirteen (13) in the United States without obtaining the required consent from the appropriate parent/guardian.
