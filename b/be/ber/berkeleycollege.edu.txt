Privacy Policy
Purpose
Berkeley College understands that your privacy is important. We want you to know what information we
may collect through our website, mobile website, mobile applications, and Short Message Service
(“SMS”) (collectively, the “Services”) and how it may be used. Continued use of the Services
constitutes your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not
use the Services.
Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to anyone using the Services. Berkeley College does not knowingly collect
data from individuals under 13 years of age through its Services. If you are under the age of 13, you are
not authorized to use the Services and should immediately stop doing so.
I. Information Collected
   Visitor Information. When you visit the Berkeley College website or otherwise use the Services,
Berkeley College’s web server and/or our third party agents automatically receives and records
Visitor Information about you. Visitor Information may include, but is not limited to your computer
operating system, web browser, IP address, internet service provider, mobile carrier, geo-location
data, cookie information, the pages you visit on the site, amount of time spent on each webpage,
and the date and time you visit the site. We do not attempt to match or link such information to an
individual’s personal information.
o    Google Analytics. Berkeley College uses Google Analytics, a third party service
provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to collect and track Visitor Information. Continued
use of the Services constitutes your consent to Google’s collection and use of your Visitor
Information. For details, see Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Practices. For details
on how to opt-out, see Google’s Safeguarding Your Data page.
o    Cookies. Berkeley College uses “cookies” to track browsing patterns and collect Visitor
Information. You may prevent or disable the use of cookies in your web browser settings.
However, disabling or deleting cookies may limit your ability to use the full functionality of
Berkeley College sites.
o    Geo-location Data. Berkeley College and/or its third party agents may collect information
about your geographic location and use that to send you location-based advertising and
information. Most mobile devices allow you to adjust the settings to disable or prevent
location information from being shared.
o    Online Tracking. Your internet browser may allow you to select a “Do Not Track” setting,
which sends a signal to websites that you do not want information about your internet
activity to be collected or tracked. Berkeley College does not respond to internet browser
“Do Not Track” signals.
   Personal Information. In addition to the information that is recorded automatically, we also
collect information that you provide to us when you complete an online form or send us e-mail.
Such information may include your full name, address, phone number, email address or other
personally identifiable information. Berkeley College makes no representations concerning the

III. How We May Use or Disclose Visitor Information or Personal Information
  Re-Marketing. The Visitor Information we automatically receive and record (such as your web

through which your visits to linked sites or advertisements may be shared with and used by our

may be interested. In addition, we may share Visitor Information or Personal Information about
you with employees of Berkeley College and affiliated entities involved in activities to which it is
relevant; with our attorneys, accountants and other professionals; and with third parties who work
with us in developing and maintaining the Services. We may also use that Visitor Information
and/or Personal Information for internal testing or training purposes, to help us develop our
website to better meet visitors' needs and expectations, or to communicate with you for any
purpose. Some Visitor Information and/or Personal Information may be stored subject to lengthy
retention requirements.
  Disclosure to Law Enforcement. Berkeley reserves the right to disclose Visitor Information
and/or Personal Information to law enforcement officials, investigators, or other third parties as
we deem necessary to prevent or address abuses of the site including, but not limited to,
violations of this Internet Privacy Policy, or when such disclosure is required by law.
  Programs of Interest. Occasionally, Berkeley College or our third party agents may use certain
information that you have provided or we have collected to send you advertisements or
information about programs, products or services offered by Berkeley College or other
organizations that we think may be of interest to you. However, Berkeley College does not sell
or rent any personal data submitted by visitors to any unrelated third parties.
