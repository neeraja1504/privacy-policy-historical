Protection of Personal Information
Bear Necessities uses reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect
against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information. No transmission of data over the internet is
guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Bear

protect personal information, neither Bear Necessities nor our service providers can ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to us over the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk.

processing and retention policies and all applicable legal obligations.
Links
You may have the opportunity to follow links on the Site to other sites that may be of interest to you. Bear
Necessities endeavors to only link to reputable organizations. Because other sites may not be hosted or

provided thereon. Therefore, the privacy policies with respect to other sites may differ from those
applicable to the Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each other site. This Privacy
Policy only applies to information collected and maintained by Bear Necessities.
