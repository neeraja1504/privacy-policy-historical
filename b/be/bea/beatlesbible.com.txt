Privacy policy – The Beatles Bible
The Beatles Bible takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it.
Detailed information is further down the page. Firstly, a jargon-free note from Joe, the site creator:
This site uses various scripts and tracking mechanisms. However, absolutely no personal information is collected and retained by me. You will never be contacted by this site as a result of visiting, unless you get in touch yourself and your message requires a response. In honesty, I'd rather spend my time writing about The Beatles than crunching visitor data to devise complex and devious marketing strategies. I'm not even very good at the latter.
The tracking is used mainly for stats collection ( WordPress and Google Analytics ), to indicate which countries visitors are coming from, which pages are the most popular, how long people spend on the site and how many pages they click on. I don't really know much more than that; nor do I need to. I certainly don't know your name, phone number, email or postal address, shoe size or political persuasion.
It is also used by third parties for advertising, which helps keep the ship afloat. There's more detail on this below.
There are social sharing buttons which have to connect to your accounts to work, otherwise nothing can be shared. I don't get to see who you are or which pages you like, although I'm very grateful if you choose to share my content with others. The aforementioned services may use cookies to track browser behaviour, but these are not set by the Beatles Bible.
There are options to subscribe to keep up-to-date via Twitter, Facebook or email. These are all third-party facilities and are optional, but please check the privacy policies of those sites if you're concerned about what they do. Again, I don't know who you are unless you choose to tell me (with the exception of Twitter, as a list of people following my account is publicly accessible).
The adverts on this site primarily come from Google, Amazon and iTunes. The first two of these uses targeting advertising to display appropriate content related to your browsing history. Again, I don't see or keep any of this information.
You can use adblockers or noscript add-ons, though I'd prefer you didn't. Please be aware that the Beatles Bible depends on advertising revenue to exist. This site is not a big business – there is no multi-millionaire backer, just one person sharing his Beatles knowledge with the world. I love good web content as much as you do, but if everyone blocked the display of advertisements this site – and many others – would no ezlonger be sustainable and its closure would be likely. I have tried to make the adverts as unobtrusive as possible, and have no plans to use popups, overlays or other annoyances.
TL;DR: I'm more interested in The Beatles than I am in spamming or tracking visitors to this site.
Sincerely,
Joe

What follows is more of a standard message to comply with various legal requirements.
Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Routine information collection
All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes.
Visitor comments and forum registrations may additionally be checked through an automated spam detection service.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (most likely for the Fab Forum), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (they cannot change their username, but may set a different display name). Website administrators can also see and edit the same information as users.
Controlling your privacy
Note that you can change your browser settings to disable cookies if you have privacy concerns. Disabling cookies for all sites is not recommended as it may interfere with your use of some sites. The best option is to disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanism.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Ezoic partnership
We use Ezoic's Ad Tester service, which allows online publishers to perform automated ad testing using machine learning. Ezoic tests ad locations, sizes, colors, types and more, then learns and personalises ad combinations to each visitor.
A percentage of Beatles Bible visitors will view pages which are subject to Ezoic's ad testing. They will see adverts in a variety of positions on the page, which over time enables us to improve the balance between revenue (to keep the site afloat) and usability.
You can view Ezoic's own privacy policy at this link.
