Privacy Policy
BeautifulHairstyles.com respects your right to privacy. Below is information on what types of personal info are received and collected when you visit this site, and how it is protected. Your personal information is never sold to third parties.
Log Files
As with most other websites, the data contained in log files is collected. The information in the log files includes: your IP (Internet Protocol) address; your ISP (Internet Service Provider); the browser you used to visit this site (e.g: Internet Explorer or Firefox); the time you visited the site; and which pages you visited throughout the site.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Cookies are used to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site. This could include only showing you a popup ad once in your visit.
Third-party advertisements on BeautifulHairstyles.com are used to support the site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise, which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit the site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (e.g: showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York), or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (e.g: showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
DoubleClick DART cookies
DART cookies may be used for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising. This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest-based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history. (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about dancing.)
DART uses “non-personally identifiable information.” It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with this site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
