Remove or edit the post.
Warn the user that a post or subject has violated the User Agreement and Posting Policy.
The poster may have their posting privileges suspended for 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or permanently. The length of the suspension is determined by the severity of the action, and/or the user’s moderation history.

If it is determined that the thread or post is in violation of our posting policy moderation action will be taken.

Personal Attacks
Bear Insider will not tolerate hateful speech, degrading remarks, or personal attacks made about other posters, athletes/coaches/faculty at University of California, or anyone else.
Due to the size, scope and diversity of this forum, subjects that elicit differing opinions and passionate beliefs will undoubtedly be posted. Please remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Refrain from attacking users in a malicious manner because their opinions and remember to direct your disagreement at a poster’s argument and not at the poster as a person. Many good threads have been derailed in the past because they have devolved from constructive debate into name calling.
Criticisms of coaches or administrators at University of California needs to be kept to their official capacities as coach or administrator. Attacking these individuals personally is not an appropriate discourse on this forum. This includes calling for the firing of a coach or administrator. In no way does this mean that we agree with the performance of a coach, or are hedging our alignment with a coaching staff or athletic department.
Posting pictures and hyperlinks
All images need to be work safe. This means no nudity, partial nudity, or pornographic images will be allowed on the site. All posts of this nature will be removed as soon as possible, and will result in an immediate suspension from the forums.
Anything hyperlinked on the Bear Insider forum that is directed to a site with inappropriate material will be considered by our moderators as being posted directly onto our forums. If you link to a site that has inappropriate content you can be suspended per our posting policies.

Premium material being shared on the other forums is not permitted. You have paid for the right to participate in those forums, but that does not mean you’re permitted to share that information with anyone you please.
We also ask that our users refrain from posting premium content on Bear Insider from other sites as well. Users found to be posting premium content from other sites may be subject to a suspension.
Usernames

Usernames found to be inappropriate by Bear Insider will be suspended, and the account holder will need to contact customer support for renaming the user account and reinstatement of posting privileges.
Using a “sockpuppet” to get around a suspension will result in a ban for the sockpuppet account, and a lengthened suspension for the original account.
Accounts may not be shared. If an account is found to be shared among more than one person, an indefinite suspension will be placed on the account until the user contacts customer support.
Usernames cannot directly reflect the name of a business or organization that is not a current advertiser without explicit, prior permission from Bear Insider.
