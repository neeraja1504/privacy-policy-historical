OUR BUSINESS
Beachfront Media, LLC has a technology platform.
We use our proprietary technology to offer advertising solutions to our clients, which includes working with advertisers to deliver their advertising campaigns across our network of publishers and application (“app”) developers (our “Platform”).
We offer products and services that help online publishers, agencies, and ad networks manage and deliver online advertising. We also own websites, and offer technology that allows content providers to place their content into applications. As a consumer, when you see an advertisement before you watch a video, or read content on a web page or an app, we may help deliver that ad from or for an advertiser to the website or application that has made the content available to you. We also provide a marketplace, where buyers and sellers of online advertising space can connect and do business.
We are not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however we do offer technologies to advertisers and publishers that allows them to sell and purchase space or digital advertisements to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be analyzed. Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or interest-related information to geographical or demographic user data, with limits to EU Users  please see GDPR section for details.  We adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND HOW IT IS COLLECTED
Personally-Identifiable Information.
We do not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell, and deliver online advertising. “Personally-Identifiable Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information we collect, may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. There may be some opportunities, for example when you use this Site, where you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal details. For example, if you were interested in becoming one of our clients or using our Services you could provide us with contact details through our Site.
Where we collect personally-identifiable information you will have clear notification of what we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.
Non-Personally-Identifiable Information.
Non-personally-identifiable information is information that, without additional information, cannot be linked to a specific individual by us. We may collect non-personally-identifiable information while you are visiting our Site or the website of one of our advertisers or Web publishers (collectively, “”customers”). For example, while providing the Services to website publishers, advertisers and those working for them, we may collect your IP address, Web pages that you visit, the time and date, and whether or not you clicked on various advertisements (collectively, “Web Surfing Data”). We understand that under GDPR definitions for personally identifiable information differs from the US. Please see the Internal Visitors and GDPR section for more information.
TECHNOLOGIES WE MAY USE FOR DATA COLLECTION

Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser.
User Data Cookies for Ad Targeting
We utilize cookies to store user data that can aid in targeting of advertisements. This data is usually collected by our Customers and used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to a user’s interests.
Use of Cookies By Others
Also, the Web publisher or advertiser with whom we partner may use cookies, action tags, GIFs, or Web beacons to collect information when you are visiting their websites.
