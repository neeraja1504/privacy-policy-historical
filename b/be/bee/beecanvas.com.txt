Personal data be processed lawfully, in good faith and transparently
Lawfulness - Identify a legal basis before it can process personal data. They are often referred to as "grounds for processing", such as "consent".
Fairness - in order for the processing to be in good faith, the data controller must provide certain information to the data subjects as far as is practicable. This applies irrespective of whether personal data is obtained directly from data subjects or from other sources.
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 increases the requirements for what information should be available to data subjects that are covered by the "transparency" requirement.
Transparency - The GDPR includes rules on the provision of confidential information to data subjects in Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR. They are detailed and specific, emphasizing that privacy notices are understandable and accessible. Information must be communicated to the data subject in comprehensible form using clear and comprehensible language.
Personal data may only be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes
Data obtained for specific purposes should not be used for a purpose that differs from those officially announced to the supervisory body as part of the BeeCanvas Data Processing (Article 30 GDPR).
Personal data must be adequate, relevant, limited to what is necessary for their processing for the purpose. (principle of minimum necessary)
