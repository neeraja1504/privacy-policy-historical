However your browser does automatically give us information about your system, such as the preferred browser language, the type of computer- and operating system you are using and your IP number. An IP number is similar to a telephone number or street address; it is identifiable information that is automatically captured by computers when communication links are made over the Internet.
Like many other websites, the Beeline Software Express websites use the so called “cookie” technology. A cookie is a temporary and unique identifier that a web server places on your computer: a small data-file that can be used to retrieve records from our databases, show webpages using personal preferences and help us to study traffic patterns on our sites. The cookies we use do not store any private information about you.
