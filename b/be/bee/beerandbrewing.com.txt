Privacy Policy | Craft Beer & Brewing
General Matters Unfiltered Media Group, LLC takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
This Policy applies to all Unfiltered Media Group Web Sites and eNewsletters (“Web Sites”). This Policy does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ Web Sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those Web Sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your rights to update or correct it. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or Web Sites that Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not own or control or to people that who Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not employ or manage. INFORMATION ABOUT YOU Information Gathered From All Visitors Aggregate Data We gather certain generic information with respect to customers’ use of our Web Sites. Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Web Sites that they prefer. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our Web Sites, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also share aggregate data of customers’ collective use of our Web Sites with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business (“Affiliates” or “Business Partners”). We do this so they, too, can improve functionality and offer services and materials that users want.
Cookies We use “cookies” on our Web Sites. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies tell our computer that you’ve visited before and can help to make your visit more personal so you don’t have to re-enter information on a return visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our Web Sites.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you’ve received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features like checking out (and participate in certain offerings) on our Web Sites if you choose not to accept cookies. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Web Sites.
Third Party Advertiser Cookies We use third-party advertising companies who use cookies to serve our ads on the Internet. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web Sites and other Web Sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Unfiltered Media Group, LLC does not use or have access to this information. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network’s Web Sites individually and opt out or visit the Web Sites of the National Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) to opt-out of all network advertising cookies at http://www.networkadvertising.org/
IP Addresses We collect and analyse traffic on our Web Sites by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We log this information so that we can monitor things like the number of visitors visiting the Web Sites; however, we do not link your IP address to any personally identifying information.
Personalizing Your Experience on the Web Sites We try to personalize your experience on our Web Sites by tracking content you have sent and purchases in order to shape our recommendations that might be of interest to you. We also examine customer traffic patterns and Web Sites usage to help us enhance the design and layout of the Web Sites and make it easier to navigate.
From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gauge user interest in new products and premiums we may offer. We will ask for your feedback on greetings and other site features. We will use the information we gather to improve our Web Sites and provide a more meaningful experience for our users. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you may be interested in.
Our email service provider also pulls in publicly available data from social channels to help us better tailor the content to you. If you're ever interested in removing yourself from all of our email lists and deleting your data, please email Haydn Strauss (hstrauss@beerandbrewing.com).

Use Common Sense in All Your Online Activities Even the best policy can’t protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.
Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings.
Any time you visit a chat room or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children’s on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.
