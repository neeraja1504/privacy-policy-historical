1. Information We Collect
We do not collect or store any of your instant message ("IM") account information, such as your user name and password, messages, or contact lists, except that we temporarily store your instant messages solely in order to complete the instant message communication (for example, in response to a dropped call); however after the communication is complete the instant message is deleted from the Beejive system. We also collect the following information:
