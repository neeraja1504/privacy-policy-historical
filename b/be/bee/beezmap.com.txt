Privacy Policy
Beezmap.com is owned and maintained by BeezMap LLC ("BeezMap"). Any inquiries related to the functions of the BeezMap.com website should be directed to BeezMap using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
BeezMap is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the BeezMap.com site. Please read the Statements below which describe in detail the kinds of data that are collected by the site, the manner in which it is stored, and the purposes it is used for. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Notification of changes to this policy will be posted on this page.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Beezmap collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Beezmap's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Beezmap's visitors use its website. From time to time, Beezmap may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Beezmap also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Beezmap posts. Beezmap only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Beezmap's websites choose to interact with Beezmap in ways that require Beezmap to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Beezmap gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account on http://Beezmap.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, Beezmap collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Beezmap. Beezmap does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Beezmap may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Beezmap may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Beezmap does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Beezmap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Beezmap's behalf or to provide services available at Beezmap's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Beezmap's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Beezmap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Beezmap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Beezmap believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Beezmap, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Beezmap website and have supplied your email address, Beezmap may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Beezmap and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Beezmap takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
