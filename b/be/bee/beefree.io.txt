If you feel you have received an email from us in error, please contact support@beefree.io .
(6) Security measures
We use security measures – such as storing your Information in an encrypted format and aggregate form – to avoid the misuse of such Information. In particular, we use Asymmetric Public Key Encryption RSA technology and our database is accessible only by authorized people with special access rights, who are required to keep the information confidential.
However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping said password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
(7) Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Website and welcome any feedback about these sites.
(8) Credit card number and billing information
With regard to payment information for BEE Plugin and BEE Pro subscriptions, we use Chargify as the recurring billing platform and Chase Paymentech as the payment gateway and merchant account provider. They are both Level 1 PCI Compliant providers, the highest level a business can attain. You can find more information about their privacy and security policies at https://www.chargify.com/privacy-policy/ and https://www.chasepaymentech.com/privacypolicy/.
(9) How we respond to Do Not Track signals
We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioural tracking). Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“ DNT ”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
(10) Accessing and correcting your Information
You can review and change your Information by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an e-mail at: support@beefree.io to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA, you can object to processing of your Information, ask us to restrict processing of your Information or request portability of your Information. Again, you can exercise these rights by emailing us at support@beefree.io. We cannot delete your Information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change Information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA are available here.
(11) Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Persons Only)
If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the Information described above will depend on the Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect and use Information from you where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Typically, our legitimate interests include improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, and services; ensuring the security of our services and our Websites; for our marketing activities; and to perform a contract with you. In some limited cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Information from you. If we ask you to provide Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Information is mandatory or not, as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Information.
Where required by law, we will collect Personal Information only where we have your consent to do so.
(12) Retention of Data
We retain Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so. Our retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we’ll refer to these criteria in order to determine retention period:
Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.
Whether the data is necessary to provide our Services.
Whether our clients have the ability to access and delete the data within their accounts.
Whether our client would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until their accounts are closed or terminated.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
(13) Changes to our Privacy Policy
It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page with a notice that the Privacy Policy has been updated on the Website home page.  If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice on our Website indicating at the top of the Notice when it was most recently updated. The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.
This policy was last modified on July 31, 2018. It was substantially modified to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. Please read the new policy in its entirety.
