Privacy Policy
We strongly believe in your fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. We strictly limit the processing of your personal information to the minimum possible for the specific purposes described in this privacy policy and we try to use the services of only those companies that respect your privacy.
Cookies
We use cookies on our website www.beuc.eu. Cookies are text files containing a small amount of data which is sent to your computer when you visit our website. They involve the collection and storage of personal information.
We only install those cookies which are strictly necessary for the correct functioning of our website.
We use the services of the analytics company Matomo (formerly known as Piwik) to analyse the use of our website and to monitor when, where and how people access information so that we can adapt the site to better suit our users' needs and measure its performance. We have chosen Matomo because it fully respects your privacy. For example, it anonymises your IP by removing its last octet, so we will never know your full IP address.
Cookies we use
Context_breakpoint cookie: This cookie checks if the user is visiting from a mobile device or not, to render the site accordingly.

Analytics cookie: We use Matomo (formerly known as Piwik) to monitor and analyse traffic on our website.

Dailymotion cookie: We use the video sharing platform Dailymotion which requires the installation of their cookie to embed videos into our website. To find out more about the privacy policy of Dailymotion please click here.
Social media: We have tried to avoid any third party social media plugins to the extent possible. The only social plugging that can be found on our site is from Twitter and is used to enable the Twitter wall in our homepage. Our website offers also the possibility to share content via the most common social media platforms. When you decide to share a piece of content through one of those platforms, our website will link you to that platform. Be advised that when you do this you are bound by the terms and conditions as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform in question.
Embedded content
Fonts: The fonts used for the content of the subpage www.ThePriceofBadAdvice.eu come from Font Awesome - you can find their privacy policy here - and Google Fonts. We unfortunately have no control over the data that Google might collect through the domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com, which are governed by Google's privacy policy. We recommend users to install privacy protection tools such as Privacy Badger in order to be protected from any possible tracking carried out by Google through these domains.
Job Vacancies
The personal data we collect during hiring processes is only used for the purposes of carrying out the selection process and is deleted once the process has ended. For shortlisted candidates, we routinely ask for their consent to keep their information for 6 months after the end of the selection process, in case other vacancies that could fit their profile open up.
