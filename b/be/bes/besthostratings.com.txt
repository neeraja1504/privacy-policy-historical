Privacy Policy - Web Hosting Reviews

What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from our site our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We store IP addresses and referrer URL to help detect problems with our server, detect manipulation of ratings, and to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
