WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?
We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address and date of birth. We request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use our service. We will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. To benefit from our service, we require you to ‘Opt-In’ to the receipt of information from third-party sellers. To provide you with the services we render, we will sell, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to third party sellers (as defined below) who will contact you to provide you with services you request through our Website. By way of example, if you choose to receive further information regarding a weight-loss or nutrition service as a result of your responses to our survey, then we will share your Personally Identifiable Information with such third party sellers so that they may contact you directly. Other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, your Personally Identifiable Information will not be disclosed.
You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you will not be able to receive valuable diet and nutrition information from third party sellers that is dependent upon the collection of such information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
When you use our Website or in connection with the services we may make available on our Website from time to time, we may also collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age or gender) and health information (like weight and body mass index (“BMI”)) ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser type, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, how our Website is used, and to improve and market our Website in general and our service in particular.
Information from Other Sources
We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and service, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our service to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general.
WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?

Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
"Action tags," also known as web beacons or .GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain cookies that are associated with action tags that are located on our Website. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer. At this time, we do not use Action tags. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy over time for updates to this section.
