3. Bestcovery's practice regarding cookies and tracking technology
Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to the Website. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit Bestcovery, although active participation in certain areas of the Website may require cookies.  Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance services we provide to you in the ways described below. By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies on your computer.
We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: Keep count of number of times you visit the Website or our advertisers' or partners' sites; collect aggregate and individual data, statistical information on the Website and advertisement usage for analysis and reporting purposes; track behaviors on the Website and to determine popularity of features and functions; implement interest-based advertising, save your username or password for easy login when you visit our Website;  and displaying the personalized advertising or content.  We use technologies that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns and we also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser and device, including but not limited to your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our Website, information about pages you visited, your location and other information. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you.
We allow other companies that are our partners, vendors or advertisers on the Website and/or our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer or device. We also use third party advertising companies to serve ads on the Website. We may provide Personal Information to these third parties as part of this relationship. These tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are unless you visit the web sites of these companies and advertisers, either directly or by clicking ads on our Website and then providing them with personally identifiable information about yourself. Cookies, 1x1 or other size pixels, .gifs or web beacons, or similar tracking technologies may be utilized or placed by third parties on your computer to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads or similar purposes. This information can include but is not limited to: date/time of ad shown, the ad that was displayed, cookies, the IP address, your inferred and expressed interests, including transactional information and product interests we derive from your visits to the Website or other web sites. The recipients of this information use it to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on the web sites of third parties. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.
For example we have implemented the Google Analytics features including but not limited to Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.  This is one of many tracking technologies that we have implemented and it only serves as an example.  In this particular example you can opt-out of certain Google Analytics features described above (and only Google Analytics features and not other technologies) or customize them using Google’s Ads Settings here: https://www.google.com/settings/ads.  We also use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. Bestcovery and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to Bestcovery.
Cookies or other tracking technologies placed on your computer by third parties by or through the Website, if any, are not within Bestcovery’s control and are not subject to the Bestcovery terms of use or Privacy Policy. If you have any questions concerning third-party cookies, please contact the third party placing such cookies to find out what information is collected and how it is used. BESTCOVERY ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY COOKIES OR TRACKING AND DATA GATHERING TECHNOLOGIES.
If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may either visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising cookies.  Note that if you opt out, you will still receive advertising. Also, if you opt out and later delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
