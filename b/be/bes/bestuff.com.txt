Best Stuff
We want to make your experience here at BeStuff! as fun and trouble-free as possible. We care about your privacy and are committed to ensure that your personal information is protected.
What information do you collect? How do you use it?
When you sign up to become a member, we only ask basic information (a username, email and password) in order to create a private member account for you. That’s all. We don’t even ask for a real name unless you want to make that your user name! Crazy, we know.
We will use your email address to verify the account and to occasionally send you news and updates about our site. We will never sell, rent or trade your email address or personal information to any 3rd party or other nasty spammy/marketing shysters. We hate junk mail as much as you (well, except if you’re Alan Ralsky)!
Apart from what you provide, we do gather “automated” information every time you visit. This is stuff like your IP address, what internet browser and operating system you’re using, the time and date of your visit and other boring statistical information. No, we’re not using high-tech espionage equipment (you’ve been watching too many spy movies!). This is just the general information that web servers collect whenever you visit a website.
We use this information to see how many people come to our site so that we can generally feel good about ourselves. It also helps us analyze how visitors interact with the website so we can improve the overall quality and performance of Bestuff.
If you’re particularly paranoid about this, then there’s loads of resources and companies that can help you stay anonymous online. To find out more just Google "internet privacy".
Are you sure you won’t sell my information?
We’re positive! We will not sell, rent or trade your personal information without your express permission - ever.
If there’s anything about our privacy policy that you’re unsure about or need us to clarify than please contact us. We’ll endeavor to keep our policies updated to make sure that are as clear as possible.
