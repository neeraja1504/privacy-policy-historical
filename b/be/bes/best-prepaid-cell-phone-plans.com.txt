Privacy Policy - Check out how your interact with us
We do our best to protect your privacy. This site is primarily composed of articles written by the authors, user-submitted reviews and comments, and advertisements. When this policy was first written a while back, the internet was a simpler place and there wasn’t much of your information out there to collect. The world has changed, and although the goal of this site is to limit the information we collect, it looks like there are a few ways that your presence here is noted due to the various widgets and gadgets on the site.
The following uses screenshots from a typical page on this site to describes to the best of our knowledge what goes on in terms of information that is created or collected during your visit.
FB Like Button
At the top of the page is the familiar Facebook Like button. This widget counts the number of people who have clicked to indicate they like this page. If you are logged into Facebook, this widget uses Facebook’s API (programmer’s interface) to tell you if you any of your friends have liked this page. However others only see the number of people who’ve like the page, and which one of their friends have like the page. In general, we have no idea who has clicked the Like button or shared the page via the Send button.
There’s a another set of buttons at the bottom of most pages that allows you to give your opinion and share it on Facebook:
We only know what button has been clicked and how many times. We don’t know who has clicked them, nor do we know the user says in the share message.
Google Search Box
Using the search button on the site takes you to a search results page which contains advertisements followed by search results from pages on my site. While we don’t know who has performed the searches, we can see some of the search terms that were used:
This helps us determine what information should be added to the site, such as which phones to review next.
User Submissions
Many of the pages have a facility for visitors to submit their own reviews and questions:
Visitors can enter their name and email if they wish to receive updates on further comments left by other visitors. The email addresses are not exposed to other visitors. In addition, we will not send additional promotional material such as offers to emails associated with these forms unless the same email is also used to sign up for an electronic newsletter or contest.
Giveaways
Occasionally the site has a giveaway:
Entries require an email address for notifying the winner. We may send notifications of further contests and other offers to these emails. There will be an opt-out link on all these emails.
