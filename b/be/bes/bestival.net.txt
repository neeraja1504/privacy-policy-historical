We would only rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests where we are assured that we would not be using your data in a way you would not expect taking into account your rights and interests.
Disclosure of Personal Information:
We may disclose your personal information to our suppliers or other external third parties for outsourcing some of the functions and services relating to the purposes for which your personal information may be processed by Bestival, for storage and otherwise to enhance our services. When we contract external services providers, we may provide them with your personal information, but only to the extent required for them to fulfil that contract, or where you would reasonably expect Bestival to disclose it to a third party for a particular purpose.
We will not sell your personal information to other parties.

Security & storage of your information:
Bestival takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of all information it collects, including that the information is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, your personal information may be stored and maintained in a secure cloud-based environment, which can be accessed only by authorised personnel. Some of these services are hosted by third parties located in Europe, Australia and the United States. However, as no data transmission over the internet or information stored on servers accessible through the internet can be guaranteed to be fully secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or receive from us online.
It may sometimes be necessary to transfer personal data overseas, in particular to Australia and the Unites States. When this is needed information may be transferred to countries or territories around the world. Any transfers made will be in full compliance with all aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation and associated legislation. Wherever your data is transferred, it may be accessed by the courts, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement and national security authorities, according to the laws in the relevant jurisdiction.
