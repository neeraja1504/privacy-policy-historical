How is my child's personal information treated?
If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent, school, teacher or guardian's express consent. Company only collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information") directly from the school, teacher, parent or guardian who has registered and paid for the Services.

In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, and/or teacher, or if we learn a minor has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request during the registration process, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a student's school, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at support@carveniche.com. Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants.
