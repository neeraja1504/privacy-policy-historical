Privacy Policy
Your Privacy
At BenQ website, we believe you have a right to know what type of information we may collect when you interact with us and our practices with respect to that information. The guidelines contained herein apply only to the BenQ websites. Sites which are linked to/from BenQ websites and via banner ads may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details. In order to participate in BenQ websites, it will be necessary for you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, e-mail address, age, mailing address, city, state and zip code and BenQ websites username and password. If you choose not to provide this information, you will not be able to participate in BenQ websites.
Collection of Information:
For each visitor to the BenQ website, BenQ' web server automatically recognizes, collects and/or stores information such as the visitor's IP address/Domain name combination and any referring sites. BenQ may use several technologies to accomplish this. Examples of such technologies are cookies and web beacons. When you visit BenQ' websites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more of the BenQ website services, or receive e-mails from BenQ we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions. BenQ may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, Web beacons for researching certain usage and activities on our Website. The information collected by BenQ or requested from third parties through these Web beacons is in an aggregate, non-individually identifiable form and is used to find out more about users including demographic information and usage patterns for more accurate reporting and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. BenQ may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, pixel tags or other technology to research or track your usage activities with respect to e-mails from us. BenQ may ask you to provide "personal information", meaning individually identifiable information such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in contests, on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, or to order products and services using these sites. BenQ may combine the information you provide on our Websites with information we may collect offline from you or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and offerings to you.
BenQ will not share the personal information you provide with any other parties, except
(a) to other affiliated BenQ companies (i.e., (i) BenQ Corporation, (ii) any company of which 50% or more of its outstanding shares are owned by BenQ Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name "BENQ" as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you (BenQ and such affiliates being collectively referred to as "BenQ"), (b) with your consent (see paragraph below), (c) as may be required by law or court order, (d) to persons or companies with whom BenQ engages to carry out or provide support for the operations of the sites or our business, or (e) to appropriate third parties, including law enforcement or other government agencies, in connection with a criminal investigation, fraud prevention, or other legal action or if BenQ reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect BenQ, its customers, or the public.

BenQ may share your personal information with third parties outside of the BenQ group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Each of these companies may have their own privacy policies.
