Tracking systems are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.

On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish the Website with personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
