1.0 Personal Information
As a leader in toolbar technology, BenefitBar understands your desire to protect personal information. We intend to inform you of how your personal information will be gathered, tracked or used, and to give you choices.
What Information We Gather and Track
We request personal information when you correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our Web site. For example, if you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your confirmation number and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing.
You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.
How We Use the Information We Gather and Track
We use personally identifiable information in the following ways:
1. To provide you with information about product upgrades and renewal information every 12 months;
2. To assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs;
With Whom We May Share Your Information
BenefitBar may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to provide technical support or handle order processing. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of BenefitBar.
Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Benefitbar to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations.
