Non-Personal, Non-Identifiable Data Collection
When you use or interact with our services, we may collect non-identifiable data, which may include but is not limited to type of Internet browser, Internet Protocol (IP addresses), geographic location (approximate), a record of how you use our services and sites, and other data that cannot be used to identify you. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
When you use our service or visit our site(s), we use something called a "cookie" that we place on your browser. This cookie can do anything from analyze how you use our service to automatically identifying you when you visit the site. This saves you time, because when a cookie is used, you may not need to enter in your password or login info over and over to use the service. Cookies are in no way linked to personally identifiable information.
In keeping with the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive, here is a list of the cookies we use on Benchmark Email and a brief summary of what they do:
Benchmark Email session cookies: These cookies identify you as a logged-in user of the site and store preferences to enhance your user experience.
Cookies with prefix "_utm": Google Analytics cookies help us track visitors to our site, as well as their behavior during their visit.
Cookies with prefix "_km": KISSmetrics tracks user behavior across our site, including sales and free trial signups.
Adroll: AdRoll is a retargeting system that helps us identify prior users and show them ads on different websites, helping us to recapture previous visitors.
Sourcetracking: Helps us identify referring sites for our affiliate program.
These cookies may be used to tailor content to you when you visit our service or other sites in the future. Cookies may last for one browser session or many, and may even be used for months or even years until they expire. If you'd like to remove, disable or prevent cookies from being installed on your machine, use the help section of your Internet browser to find out how you can make adjustments to your cookie settings.

The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media plug-ins) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies.
Additionally, we employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

In order to serve you better and deliver the features you like most, we may conduct research on customer interests, behavior and demographics, based on the personal data we have collected. This research will be studied and analyzed on an aggregate basis, which means it will not identify you personally. Hence, it is considered non-personal data under our privacy policy.
Using Our Email Service
You can import contacts from various CRM systems and other email account address books to populate your email recipient lists. We collect the username and password for the account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose.
When sending emails via our service, we maintain strict privacy for all your data. Hence, if you upload or create an email list and store it online, and decide to purge or delete those email addresses, we do not keep them on our servers. They are gone forever, so please take note to export your data before you delete it if you may need to use it in the future.
While we may review your list when you upload it, just to make sure it's opt-in, we do not monitor or review the content beyond that first stage.
Also, when you create or upload an email list and store it with our service, we do not sell, rent or give away the data on your list. That data is yours and yours alone, we merely store it for you when you use our service.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
