Reasons We Share the Information We Collect
We do not sell or otherwise disclose information that we collect to others, except as described in this Privacy Statement. Bentley may share your information that we collect with our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.
In some cases, Bentley may share information with vendors or companies that help us run our business by processing information on behalf of Bentley.  This shared information would be for the purposes of data processing or hosting or storage, delivering customer support, processing credit card payments, social media and marketing, event support, and sending emails on our behalf. In such cases, these companies will be permitted to obtain only the information that they need to deliver the respective services and are not allowed to use your information for any other purpose, except where required by law. Such vendors and agents must abide by our data privacy and security requirements, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, except where required by law to disclose your information. Bentley may also share information with carefully selected strategic partners who provide services and sponsor events that may be of interest to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information and use it in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices.
Some Bentley web pages allow you to choose to share your information with select Bentley partners so that they can contact you about their products, services, or offers. Other sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Bentley on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s particular offering (without transferring your information to the third party).
Some Bentley services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Bentley and the other company may receive information collected in connection with the co-branded services. The other company's use of your information is subject to such other company's own privacy policies and practices, and Bentley is not responsible for the privacy practices of, or use of your information by, such other companies.
We may share your personal information with trusted participants in our sales and marketing chain, including, but not limited to, authorized resellers, distributors, and business partners ("Channel Partners") for the limited purposes of selling, marketing, or providing support for certain product and service offerings. When these Channel Partners transfer information to us, we treat that information as described in this Privacy Statement. We take measures to help ensure that our Channel Partners protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any personal information we share with them.
We may access and/or disclose information we collect if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Bentley; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bentley (including the enforcement of our agreements) or third parties; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Bentley services or members of the public. If we merge with another company or reorganize some part or all of our business, assets, or stock (including if we file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share information we collect from and about you in connection with the merger or reorganization. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer may continue to use information that we collect from and about you as set forth in this Privacy Statement.

All of our email communications include the ability to opt-out from receiving future emails, except those emails that are necessary to provide you with the services you have requested or purchased. If you have any questions about your choices regarding how we use and disclose your personal information, or how to exercise these choices, please contact us via our contact us form.
We encourage you to contact us if you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint or inquiry by clicking on this contact us link.

Other Important Privacy Information

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect this information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as Transport Layer Security. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
Collection and Use of Children’s Information
Bentley webpages and services are intended for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Bentley webpage does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide personal information to us. Bentley strongly encourages you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online and about using the Internet safely.
Use of Cookies
We and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites, services, applications, tools, and electronic communications (collectively referred to as our “ sites and services ”) that automatically receive and track certain data about your device and interaction with our sites and services. You can read more here about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.
Use of Third-Party Ad Networks
The majority of the online banner advertisements that you see on Bentley web pages are displayed by Bentley. However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Bentley web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Bentley does not have access to nor does it control the cookies that may be placed on your computer by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. You can read more here about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.
Bentley maintains relationships with a number of third-party ad networks currently operating. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative.
Links to Other Sites
