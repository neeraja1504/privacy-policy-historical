Please be aware that Morgan Stanley may also share your information (including personal, transactional and tax information), along with information about how you use our online services, with your current and/or former employer for administrative purposes such as record keeping or to assess satisfaction with our services, to comply with laws, regulations, legal processes and law enforcement requirements, and any other purposes that complies with applicable law and regulation.

If we have information from you, or information that is available from other sources, including from third parties (like your current and/or former employer), from both offline and online sources, we may use it in combination with the information that we have collected through our online services. We can use this information to better tailor and personalize our services and communications with you, both online and offline, and for any other purpose that complies with applicable law and regulation.
We may also use and share data that we collect on an aggregate or anonymous basis (such that it does not identify any individual consumer) for various business purposes, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We, our affiliates and/or other persons acting on our or their behalf, use cookies and similar technology, such as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or pixel tags), or similar technologies as they may develop over time. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect, use, and share information when you visit our online services or interact with us online, e.g., via email or other electronic means.

We have internal policies governing the proper handling of personal information by our personnel and requiring third parties that provide support on our behalf to adhere to appropriate security standards with respect to such information. As noted above, your current and/or former employer also will receive your personal information along with transactional and tax information and they will be subject to their own internal security procedures.
Updating Your Information
You may review, or update certain account information by logging into our online service. If you cannot change the incorrect information online, or you prefer to request changes offline, please update such information by contacting your financial advisor or customer service using the contact information listed on your account statements, records, or other account materials.

Information you disclose to other parties (including your current and/or former employer) or through such websites, is subject to the privacy and security practices and policies of those parties or websites. We disclaim all liability with regard to your access to such linked websites. Access to any other websites is at your own discretion and we encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every website or online services visited, in order to learn how such third parties may treat your information.
