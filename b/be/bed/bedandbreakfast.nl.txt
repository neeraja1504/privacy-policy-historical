Cookies
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the computer of a user of our website.
Working action of cookies
There are different types of cookies, which are used for different purposes. Cookies can be distinguished in function, lifespan and by the company that placed them.
BBE and the use of cookies
BBE offers a very extensive and user-friendly website that is automatically adjusted to the wishes and the preferences of its users. In order to do this, BBE uses 4 types of cookies:
Technical cookies: BBE uses technical cookies for showing the website and to let it function correctly, for creating your account, to enable you to log in and to maintain your reservations. These technical cookies are only necessary to let our website function well.
Functional cookies: Functional cookies are also used. These cookies remember your preferences and help you use the website as effectively and efficiently as possible. For example by remember the language of your preference, as well as your search results and the bed & breakfasts you have viewed. These functional cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of the website, but make things a lot easier for you as a user and enable you to get the best out of our website.
Analytical cookies are used to gain an insight into the use of our website. That way, BBE will find out what does and what does not work, how BBE can improve and optimize its website and eventually, always remain interesting and relevant for its users. For this, among other things the following information is collected: visited web pages, the page that referred visitors to the BBE website, the last page that was viewed during a visit to the website, type of platform, date, time an details as well as the number of (mouse) clicks on the web pages, the mouse movements, scrolling and the (search) terms you use and the text you type when using our website. This information is made anonymous before it is used, because it is only meant for statistical purposes.
And finally, the commercial cookies, which are used to show ads of BBE when you visit other websites (so-called retargeting), possibly based on the destinations you searched for or the accommodations you have viewed. These cookies are usually placed by reliable third parties.
How long do cookies remain active?
BBE uses different types of cookies, each with their own lifespan. The maximum lifespan we have set for a number of the cookies is 5 years. All cookies can be removed from the browser at any given moment. You can find the BBE cookies in your browser settings.
Collaboration with third parties
BBE uses the services of reliable and acknowledged online ad companies and marketing companies. To enable this, these companies need to place cookies. Providers that BBE works with strive to build up consumer awareness and putting the standards in the field of corporate responsibility and data management on record. Most of these companies are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The members of NAI and IAB are obliged to industrial standards and behaviour codes. The NAI and IAB members offer a general opt-out option for the advertisements generated by commercial cookies. On the websites of www.networkadvertising.org and www.youronlinechoices.com you will find the names of the NAI members who have placed commercial cookies on your computer. If you no longer want to see ads that are generated by commercial cookies of NAI- and IAB-members, you can enable them by checking the boxes of the companies concerned on the above mentioned websites.
Access to BBE cookie data
Only BBE has access to the BBE cookie data. However, it is possible that BBE occasionally uses the services of third parties for marketing analysis and quality improvement. These external service providers can have access to the cookies that were placed by third parties. BBE only makes a statistical analysis of the behaviour of the users for its own website. BBE does not follow what you do online. It is possible that you see ads of BBE on other websites (so-called retargeting), based on the visitor history on our own website. This information is anonymous. BBE does not follow you on any other websites than its own.
Managing cookie-preferences
By means of your browser settings (in for example Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome) you can point out which cookies you accept and which cookies you don’t accept. It depends on the type of browser where you can find these settings. By means of the ‘Help’ function of your browser you can easily find this out.
Note: if you point out not to accept certain cookies, it is possible that you can no longer use certain functions of the website. It is also good to know that an opt-out in an advertising network does not mean that you will never be shown advertisements again or that you will never be part of a marketing analysis again. Opting-out simply means that you will no longer receive customized advertisements from the network you have blocked.
