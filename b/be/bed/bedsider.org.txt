Privacy Policy - Bedsider
Welcome to Bedsider.org and the Bedsider network (collectively, “Bedsider”). Bedsider is operated by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy (“The National Campaign,” “we,” or “us”).
This page lists all the privacy stuff you need to know. There’s a lot of text, so here’s the summary: Your privacy is important to us. We’ll never sell your name or information. Ever. But there may be times we share it with our partners if they’re providing a service to you.
Information we collect
Personal Information. We may collect and store any information that you choose to enter through Bedsider. This includes personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, zip code, and date of birth, and other information (personal and non-personal) about you that you may submit through Bedsider, including through any content that you provide. We may require that you provide some personal information in order to participate in certain features we offer. In some cases, we may combine this information with personal information we have collected about you from other sources.

We may combine this automatically-gathered information with other information, including personal information we have collected about you.
Cookies. When you visit Bedsider, we may assign your computer a “cookie” (a small, unique identifier text file) to remember who you are. We also may include other information in our cookie files; for example, if you arrived at Bedsider via a link from a third-party site, we may include the URL of the linking page. In addition, we collect gender, age, and interest information from 3rd parties using Google Analytics. We may combine the information we collect through cookies with other information, including personal information we have gathered about your visit in aggregate to improve our services.

How you can delete or update your information
You can delete or update the personal information you have provided on Bedsider.org by contacting us at info@bedsider.org.
Website visitors who don’t want their visit data reported by Google Analytics can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript running on Bedsider (and other websites) to prohibit sending visit information to Google Analytics. Additionally, visitors that have installed the opt-out browser add-on are not exposed to Content Experiments.
If you want to opt-out of Analytics for the web, visit the Google Analytics opt-out page and install the add-on for your browser. For more details on installing and uninstalling the add-on, please see the relevant help resources for your specific browser.
The Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to web analytics services.
How we protect your information
We have implemented procedures to help protect the personal information that you provide to us. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
Children’s privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Should we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete that information from our database.
A special word about public forums
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in public forums, that information can be collected and used by others. This includes any information that you choose to make publicly available. For this reason, we encourage users not to post any sensitive information, including personal information, in any public forums.
External links
If any part of Bedsider.org links you to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
