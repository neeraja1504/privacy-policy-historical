COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
When you create an Beyluxe username, you will be asked to enter your first and last names, your age and gender, an e-mail address, your country of residence and (if applicable) your state of residence, a URL reference, a secret question, an answer, and password. We may also collect additional data from you, including demographic information, preferences, interests, and favorites. In addition, you may enter additional information in the profile for your nickname, including a picture in gif or jpg format. Information collected by Beyluxe may be combined with information obtained from Beyluxe or other Beyluxe companies.
If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service (such as permanent rooms, a different colored nickname etc.), we will collect additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, that is used to create an Beluxe billing account.
We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Beyluxe sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type, hardware identification and language, access times, and referring Web site addresses.
One Chat S.R.L may also obtain information about you through the monitoring or recording of your activities while you are using the B program or services. You have consented to such monitoring or recording by agreeing to the provisions of the End User License Agreement when you installed or used the program. Any personal information obtained through such monitoring or recording will be treated in the same manner as all other information referenced in this Privacy Statement. Such monitoring or recording, however, will only take place under the circumstances set forth below.
One Chat S.R.L wants you to enjoy Beyluxe with the minimum of intrusions. Unfortunately, there are people who use internet chat room services like Beyluxe to harass other users or engage in criminal activity. Thus, in the course of administering Beyluxe, we may visit and monitor activity in a chat room without the knowledge of the room owner or room participants in order to determine whether any rules or polices of Beyluxe are being violated, or whether any illegal activity is taking place. However, we do not regularly monitor chat rooms. We may monitor a chat room under the following circumstances:
1. We are requested to do so by a room owner or room admin; or
2. We have reason to believe that illegal activity, or activity that violates Beyluxe rules and policies, is taking place in the room.
When we decide to monitor a room, we will do so only as long as necessary to determine whether any illegal or improper activity is taking place. We may, but we are not obligated to, notify the room owner, room admins, or room participants of our presence in the room. Beyluxe's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on Beyluxe and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation. By knowing a little about you, Beyluxe is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.
Beyluxe collects and uses your personal information to operate Beyluxe and deliver the services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content and advertising based upon the information we have collected. In order to provide services, your information may be accessed and used by Beyluxe to provide such services. Any use of such information within Beyluxe will remain subject to the limitations of this privacy statement.
