WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
The information Beyond the Rack gathers falls into two categories:
Personally identifiable information, which includes personal information you supply when you register, order, complete a survey, enter a contest, provide your email address or provide your friends’ emails addresses and
Non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate the Website.
Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Us
Registration
Registration for the BTR Services requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information, including, in most cases, your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password to register. This allows BTR to provide you access to your account every time you visit the Website. Beyond the Rack keeps track of your information to offer you the best possible shopping experience.
Paid Products and Services
To enable the purchase of products, we also collect and store billing and credit/Visa Debit card information as well as your address, telephone number or any other information required to process your order.
This information may be disclosed to specific members of our staff and to select third parties (such as our credit/Visa Debit card processor and shipping provider) involved in the completion of your transaction and delivery of your order. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit or Visa Debit card payments service providers.
We will also use your email address and/or telephone number to notify you about new services, special promotional programs, promotional offers or any information related to BTR Services.
At any time, you can notify us that you wish to stop receiving these emails or telephone calls by either:
Making the appropriate selections in your account management center, or
Following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each email, or
Contacting us at unsubscribe@beyondtherack.com requesting that we remove your email and/or telephone number from our database. To do so please include your email and/or telephone number in the body of your email, and put "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, or

Personal Information about Children
The Website is targeted for use by a general audience; BTR does not market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, BTR does not collect age identifying information nor does BTR knowingly collect any personal information, even in aggregate, from children under the age of 13 years. However, we hereby advise all visitors to the Website under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on the Website. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to BTR, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protect Act (see the Federal Trade Commission's website), we will delete the child's personally identifiable information from our files and databases to the extent technologically possible.

We do not store this additional information.
Social Media Widgets

BTR uses SociableLabs to operate our referral program. Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, Personal Information may be securely transferred to SociableLabs or other third parties in the context of the referral program, but only to the extent needed for the referral program to operate properly. This transfer of Personal Information is described in the next paragraph of this section. By using the referral program, you consent to our use of your Personal Information in this manner. If you do not consent to the use of your Personal Information in this manner, please do not use the referral program.
The referral program will access your web-based email service (currently limited to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or AOL). If you are not otherwise logged-in to the email service, it may ask you for your password in order to log in. Your password is not stored by either us or SociableLabs, and is only transferred securely to your email provider in order to log in for the referral program to function. The referral program will access your contacts from your email program, and may ask for your authorization to do so. No emails are sent to your contacts without your consent, as you must confirm to which email addresses you send a referral. Use of your email service is also governed by your email provider’s Terms of Use and / or Privacy Policy.
When you share a link through the referral program via Facebook or Twitter, if you are not otherwise logged in, you may be asked for your login information, and your login information is transferred securely to those services. Your use of these services is covered by their respective Terms of Use and / or Privacy Policies.
BTR and SociableLabs are in full compliance with both the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. Ch. 103) and the Canadian law Informally known as Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (“CASL”, S.C. 2010, c. 23) within the referral program. BTR As part of our referral program, emails are sent which are subject to anti-spam laws, including the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act and Canada’s Anti-Spam Law. As these laws have different requirements based on the email recipient’s home country, it is important to distinguish your recipients. By using the referral program, you acknowledge that if you are using the American version of the website and referral program, you are sending to American recipients. If you are using the Canadian version of the website and referral program, you are sending to Canadian recipients.
If you believe you have been sent an email in error or in violation of these laws OR your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database by either:
Making the necessary changes in your member information page, or

Compliance with Legal Process

The parties expressly exclude any other terms, including any terms and conditions which the Buyer may purport to add to any Order or other document. To the extent that any provision in Buyer's Order or other document purports to supplement, amend or delete any provision in these Terms and Conditions, such provisions shall be deemed to be void, excluded and are not binding on the Seller.

The Seller's employees are not authorized to make any representations, warranties or conditions concerning the Goods unless confirmed by the Seller in writing. The Buyer acknowledges that it does not rely on representations concerning the Goods which are not confirmed in this way.
3. Orders and Acceptance
Buyer may submit an Order to Seller during a Sales Event. Seller has the sole discretion to determine the beginning, duration and end of all Sales Events. Seller may terminate a Sales Event at any time, in its sole discretion.
All Orders are subject to acceptance by the Seller, evidenced as the Seller issuing an Order Confirmation. The Buyer's Order constitutes an offer to purchase Goods at the Purchase Price in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and is not binding on the Seller unless and until the Seller has issued an Order Confirmation. The Buyer may cancel an Order, even if an Order Confirmation has been received, prior to the end of the Sales Event. The Buyer cannot cancel an Order for any reason after the end of the Sales Event.
The Seller reserves the right to reject the Buyer's Order in whole or in part without any liability to the Buyer, for any reason or for no reason, as determined by the Seller in its discretion, including if the Goods are unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances (including Orders exceeding reasonably anticipated demand), or are in imperfect condition at the expected time of shipment.
The Seller may reject or cancel an Order for which an Order Confirmation has been issued for the following reasons:
The advertised price and/or Purchase Price on the Website, the Order and/or the Order Confirmation is incorrect due to a typographical error, failure to update, or inaccurate information received by the Seller from any person, including the Buyer or for any other reason;
Orders received by the Seller for a particular Good exceed the Seller's reasonably anticipated demand;
The description of the Goods on the Website, the Order and/or the Order Confirmation is incorrect due to a typographical error, failure to update, or inaccurate information received by the Seller from any person or for any other reason. All content on the Website, including any descriptions, specifications, drawings or prices of the Goods, is published for guidance only. The Buyer acknowledges that such information is provided to the Seller by third party manufacturers and that the Seller is not liable for mistakes in such information. Seller's sole remedy in such event is to return the Goods in accordance with the return procedure set out below.
In the event of a rejection or cancellation as set out in Sections 3.3 or 3.4, the Seller has no liability or obligation to the Buyer whatsoever, including any obligation to source an alternate supplier of the Goods, find a replacement Good, and/or pay any consideration to the Buyer.
The Seller may make minor modifications / substitutions in the design and specification of the Goods at any time without notice to the Buyer, even if an Order Confirmation has been issued. In the case of material modifications to the Goods, the Seller shall notify the Buyer of such material modifications. The Buyer may accept or reject the Good as modified within 48 hours of the email being sent by the Seller. If the Seller has not received a response from the Buyer within this time period, the Seller will refund the Purchase Price as per the original payment method(s) and cancel the Order, even if an Order Confirmation has previously been issued.
4. Advertised Price, Payment, Currency and Shipping
All advertised prices shown on the Website are exclusive of applicable sales, use, excise, goods and services / harmonized and other taxes, freight, shipping and handling. Any such fees and charges that are charged to or collected by the Seller are added to the advertised price, as shown in the Order Confirmation and are the responsibility of the Buyer.
If the Goods are shipped to a location outside of Canada and the United States, there may be additional export/import duties, tariffs, charges, taxes and other fees which are levied on the Goods. The Buyer is responsible for payment of any such amounts. Please note that the Seller has no control over these amounts and cannot predict how much they will be. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.
The Buyer will pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the procedures set out in the Seller's website.
Payment is made by credit or Visa Debit card. The Seller will charge the Buyer's credit or Visa Debit card immediately upon acceptance of the Order and issuance of the Order Confirmation.
The Buyer may redeem any existing credit on the Buyer's account towards the price of the Good, but not any applicable sales, use, excise, goods and services / harmonized and other taxes, freight, shipping and handling, provided that credits for Goods previously returned by the Buyer and accepted by the Seller may be applied towards the cost of freight, shipping and handling. All credits must be redeemed prior to the Buyer submitting the Order.
Promotional credits (coupon codes and gift cards) expire 30 days from date of issue and must be used within that period, unless otherwise specified. Beyond the rack reserves the right to modify or cancel promotional credits at any time.
All prices shown are U.S. dollars, other than for Buyers in Canada, for whom prices are shown in Canadian funds. Buyers in Canada will be charged in Canadian funds. All other Buyers will be charged in U.S. dollars. The Buyer is responsible for any variations and fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Buyer's local currency and any exchange fees charged by Buyer's credit/debit card company.
5. Delivery
The place for delivery of the Goods will be set out on the Order Confirmation.
Any dates quoted for delivery of the Goods are estimates only. Time for delivery will not be of the essence and the Seller will not be liable for any loss or expenses sustained by the Buyer arising from any delay in the delivery of the Goods howsoever caused.
In the event that the quantity of Goods delivered is less than the quantity of Goods as indicated on the accompanying invoice or bill of lading, the Buyer shall accept the Goods delivered, shall note the shortage on the carrier's bill of lading, if possible, and shall notify the Seller of the shortage as set out in Section 5.5. For clarity, the Buyer may not reject the Goods or any part of them solely on the grounds of short delivery of an Order. The Buyer shall pay for such delivered Goods as if it was a delivery of an Order in installments (see Section 5.5).
If the Goods are alleged to be damaged on delivery, a description of the alleged damage or Fault must be given in writing to the carrier at the time of delivery, if the alleged damage or Fault is obvious upon receipt. The Buyer must notify the Seller of the damage as set out Section 5.5.
The Buyer must notify the Seller of any short delivery or Goods damaged in delivery, in writing, within three days of delivery. If the Buyer fails to do so within this time, the Goods are deemed to be delivered in good condition and in the quantities set out on the invoice and/or bill of lading. In each case, the notification must include the invoice number, Order Confirmation number, delivery note number and details of the claim. In the case of a valid claim for damaged Goods, the Seller may, in its sole discretion, replace the Goods (or the part in question) or refund to the Buyer the Purchase Price (or an appropriate proportion of the Purchase Price) exclusive of import/export or customs duties, tariffs, charges and/or other charges, as per the Buyer's original method(s) of Purchase. Damaged Goods must be returned to the Seller. In the case of a short shipment, other than a shipment that has been partially cancelled pursuant to Section 3.4, the Seller shall deliver the outstanding portion of the Order. In either case, the Seller will thereafter have no further liability to the Buyer for the short shipment or damaged Goods.
The Seller reserves the right to make delivery of the Goods by installments, without notice to the Buyer.
If the Buyer fails to take delivery of the Goods, the Seller may pursue any remedy legally available, including either or both of the following:
The Seller may store the Goods until actual delivery is effected and charge the Buyer for the cost (including insurance) of storage, together with any other reasonable incidental costs; and/or
sell the Goods at the best price readily obtainable by the Seller and (after deducting all storage and selling expenses) charge the Buyer for any shortfall below the Purchase Price.
The Buyer must advise the Seller in advance, in writing, of any requested alteration, cancellation or deferral of delivery, which the Seller may accept or reject at its discretion. The Seller reserves the right to make a charge (which will not normally be less than 20% of the cost of the Good altered, deferred or cancelled).
Goods may not be returned to the Seller except as provided in Sections 7 and 8 below.
6. Risk and Property
Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods will pass to the Buyer on delivery at the address set out in the Order Confirmation.
In the case where no signature or other proof of receipt is required by the carrier, all such Orders reported as delivered by the carrier shall be deemed to be delivered to and received by the Buyer. The Seller is not responsible for any lost or stolen Orders; the Buyer is solely responsible for selecting a secure delivery location.
In the case where a signature or other proof of receipt is required by the carrier upon delivery, any signature on that document, or other proof of receipt, will constitute conclusive evidence of delivery of the Order to the Buyer.
7. Product Returns
The Buyer shall have the right to return Goods in the following circumstances:
for any reason, within one year(30 Days)beginning on the day after the Buyer receives the Goods, provided that this one year(30 Days) return period does not apply to:
Goods that cannot be accepted for return due to hygienic reasons (such as, but not limited to, toiletries, cosmetics and beauty products, lingerie, some leather goods, swimwear, earrings, duvets and pillows);
Goods that have been made to the Buyer's specifications or personalized;
Goods that been assembled or installed by or on behalf of the Buyer, in whole or in part;
Goods that, by their nature cannot be returned, or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly; and
Goods that are sold during "clearance" or "blowout" sales.
within ten (10) days of delivery in the case of Faulty Goods (other than damage that is or should have been apparent upon delivery, which is subject to the three-day notification period set out in Section 5.5). Upon the Seller's confirmation that the Good is Faulty, the Seller will refund the Purchase Price as per the original payment method(s). However, this does not apply to Goods with a minor fault or defect, as determined by the Seller, that are capable of rectification, and are so rectified by the Seller at the Seller's cost. In the case of a minor fault or defect, the Seller may rectify the fault or defect by repair and/or a partial refund (as a BTR account credit), as determined by the Seller.
Notice of the Buyer's wish to return the Goods must be made in accordance with the notice provision in Section 11.2 below. The return package must be postmarked within the return periods noted above.
The Buyer must comply with the return procedure in Section 8 to obtain a BTR account credit. Failure to comply with such procedure will result in the Goods being rejected and returned to the Buyer.
All Goods returned by the Buyer to the Seller must be the original Goods as delivered to the Buyer, in their original, undamaged packaging and must be in an unused condition (except only in the case of Goods which have been discovered to be Faulty).
Under no circumstances will the Seller accept any returned Goods, even if Faulty, that have been tampered with, modified or replaced or switched with counterfeit and/or different products, in whole or in part, as determined by the Seller in its discretion. In such event, the Seller may reject the refund claim, retain the returned products, notify local law enforcement agencies in the Buyer's jurisdiction and/or pursue civil remedies against the Buyer.
In the event that any return does not comply with these Terms and Conditions, the Seller reserves the right to refuse either all or some of the BTR account credit which would otherwise be due in respect of such returned Goods.
8. Procedure for Returned Goods
All returns must be made pursuant to the Returns Authorization procedure set out on the back of the packing slip.
Provided that the Buyer has complied with these Terms and Conditions with respect to any returned Goods, the Seller shall issue a refund of the Purchase Price exclusive of any import/export or customs duties, tariffs, charges and/or other charges, subject to subsections 8.3 and 8.4 below). Refund shall be made by the issuance of a store credit to the Buyer's BTR account, other than for returns of Goods damaged on delivery or Faulty, in which case the Seller will refund the Purchase Price as per the original payment method(s). This provision of a BTR account credit is the Buyer's sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the Goods, including any claim that the Goods are Faulty or counterfeit.
In the case of cancellation under Section 7.1.1 above, the Buyer is responsible for the costs of freight, shipping and handling and insurance to return the Goods to the Seller. If this is paid by the Seller, the Seller may deduct such amounts from any BTR account credit due to the Buyer (or to charge the Buyer, as the case may be).
In the case of cancellation under Section 7.1.2 above, the Seller shall be responsible for freight, shipping and handling (including initial and re-delivery charges (if any)) in respect of the Goods, and shall refund the Purchase Price exclusive of any import/export or customs duties, tariffs, charges and/or other charges.

Such amount shall be the Buyer's sole remedy, and the Seller's sole liability for such matters.
This limitation of liability shall prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent provision contained in any provision of these Terms and Conditions.

20. BTR Travel Services
TERMS AND CONDITIONS – IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR TRAVEL RESERVATIONS AND DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS
Beyond The Rack Travel, represented by Transat Distribution Canada Inc., a Quebec licensee (“TDC”), acts as an intermediary between you and your selected carriers, hotels, tour organizers, tour operators and other service providers (the “Service Providers”). Consequently, TDC can under no circumstances be held liable to you or your travel companions for the travel services rendered by said Service Providers (the “Travel Services”). TDC, in its capacity as travel agent, assumes no liability for Service Providers’ failure to perform their obligations, including but not limited to, for any damage or loss resulting from delay, cancellation, property loss, illness, injury, accident, death, quality of services, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment, disappointment or any event amounting to an act of God or force majeure.
PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS
All Travel Services must be paid in full at the time of reservation with TDC and these Travel Services are non-transferable and non-refundable. You are responsible for verifying the terms and conditions in the brochure of the Service Providers corresponding to the Travel Services purchased. Some airline tickets are issued at a special rate that carries restrictions. In the event of any discrepancy between these terms and conditions and those of any Service Providers or those stated in the beyondtherack.com website, the terms and conditions stated herein shall prevail. If full payment is not received or not honored by our credit card processor or financial institution, TDC reserves the right to cancel your reservation without notice and without reimbursement. Travel insurance must also be paid in full at the time of reservation. In the event of a cancellation of any Travel Services purchased from TDC prior to departure, TDC will keep 100% of the total cost of such cancelled Travel Service received from you. If you request a change to any Travel Services, TDC or the Service Providers may allow, at their discretion, such change subject to the payment of certain change fees. If such change to your Travel Services is not allowed or you choose not to travel or use the Travel Services purchased, a cancellation fee equal to 100% of the total cost of the Travel Service will be charged by TDC. Please contact TDC at 1-866-815-5196 with respect to any change request.
TRAVEL DOCUMENTS
It is your entire responsibility to obtain, at your own expense, all required travel documents (including but not limited to passport, visa, tourist card, permanent resident card, official documents) and to abide by the laws in place at your travel destinations. TDC cannot be held liable for any damages resulting from failure to obtain travel documents or any delay which you may experience in obtaining such documents. TDC advises consumers to visit the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade at the following address: www.dfait.gc.ca. The site provides information and assistance for Canadians travelling abroad. Travel document requirements are subject to change; you are advised to check for such changes prior to your travel.
FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
A Canadian passport is required; some countries require up to 6 months validity beyond your anticipated stay and a visa may be required; check with your travel agent. Recommended check-in time is at least 2 hours (for U.S. travel) or 3 hours (for international travel) prior to departure. Failure to check in at least 60 minutes prior may result in cancellation of your reservation or advanced seat assignment. Please re¬confirm all international flights 24 hours prior to departure directly with the airline. Living standards and practices in other countries, and the conditions there with respect to the provision of utilities, services and accommodations, may differ greatly from those found in Canada and the United States. A previous criminal record could be an obstacle in U.S. and international travel leading to denied entry. Medical inoculations may be recommended depending on the country or region to which you are travelling.
CHILDREN
If a minor (i.e. under 18) is travelling with only one parent, either (i) the absent parent must provide notarized consent or (ii) the travelling parent must provide proof of sole custody or a notarized letter that the other parent is deceased, as the case may be. All notarized consent letters should indicate the destination and length of travel, as well as consent to provide emergency medical treatment if required. If a minor is travelling alone or is accompanied by an adult other than a parent, both parents (or the sole documented custodial parent) must provide notarized consent. If a minor travelling alone has only one parent as evidenced by its birth certificate, a notarized copy of the birth certificate or the original together with the notarized consent of the parent will be sufficient proof allowing for travel. If a minor child travelling alone has only one parent due to the death of the other parent, the notarized consent of the custodial parent is required.
INSURANCE
For each reservation, TDC offers you and your travel companions the option of taking out an insurance policy to protect you and your travel companions against certain events – including but not limited to coverage for trip cancellation or interruption, out of country medical, travel accident, baggage, personal effects, personal money, travel delay, etc. – that may occur before, during or after (for a specified number of weeks) your trip. You hereby acknowledge that TDC made this offer of insurance in good faith and that you have made an informed decision to take out or refuse such insurance and to assume full liability for your decision.
WAIVER AND RELEASE
You hereby acknowledge and agree that TDC will not be liable or responsible for any losses incurred by you or your travel companions resulting from denied boarding of an aircraft, vessel or any other mode of transportation, for unsatisfactory trip conditions or for any other matter relating to the trip. You and your travel companions hereby release TDC and its directors, officers, agents, employees from any liability or claim that your or your travel companions now have or may ever have relating to the your trip.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
By reserving travel services, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms and conditions and you are expressly acknowledging that TDC has sufficiently advised you in respect of the above listed matters.
