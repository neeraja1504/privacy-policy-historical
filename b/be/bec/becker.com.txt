General
As part of Adtalem Global Education (“Adtalem”), Becker Professional Education (“Becker,” “we,” or “us”) respects the privacy of every individual who visits our web sites or responds to our promotions. As a data controller, we intend to act reasonably to protect your privacy, but we cannot guarantee security against issues beyond our control. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on our web site, unless otherwise posted.

For purposes of this Statement, personal data means information that is collected about you. We do not collect any personal data from you unless you freely consent to provide it. Examples of personal data that we may collect from you include name, email address, age, and phone number. If you do not want your personal data collected, do not submit it to us.

If you have a question, or would like to review or delete your child’s personal data, contact us at the address below.

We use third-party service providers for marketing purposes and to conduct surveys or contests.  These companies are prohibited from using our participants’ personal data for any other purpose.  We will not share the personal data you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties without your express consent.

Cookies
We may collect other personal data from you that is not collected along with your name.  Although most of this information is collected from you when you freely consent to submit it, some of it may be collected automatically by use of a “cookie.”
Cookies are small text files that are downloaded onto your computer or other device when you access a website. Cookies allow the website to recognize your device and store information about your preferences or past actions.  For instance, cookies may enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password or be used by third party content providers such as news feeds.  Cookies may also allow us to track your status or progress when ordering products from us.
What kinds of Cookies do we use?
Strictly Necessary Cookies
Certain cookies we use are necessary for the website to function.  Strictly necessary cookies are typically set in response to actions or services that you request, such as setting your privacy preferences or putting items in a shopping basket.  If you set your browser to block these cookies, some parts of the site will not work.
Functionality Cookies
We use functionality cookies to remember the choices you make, such as your user name, language or text size. These cookies help to improve your experience on the site by providing a more personalized service.
Performance Cookies
We use performance cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.  They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how frequently the same people revisit the site, how the site is found (from advertising or referring websites), and which pages are most frequently viewed. This information is combined with data from thousands of other users to create an overall picture of site use, and is never identified individually or personally and is not linked to any other information we store about you. For more information about Google Analytics, or how to opt out of Google Analytics cookies, please visit Google’s Privacy Policy and Opt out page.
Third Party Cookies
Some of our webpages use third-party services or software, such as maps, online videos, or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies on your device. These third party cookies help us enhance your website experience and improve our services by tracking your online activity.  We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.
Marketing and Advertising Cookies
We partner with third party advertisers may use tracking pixels that set cookies to assist with delivering online advertising that is relevant to your interests. We, or our advertising partners, may build a profile of your interests and show you targeted advertisements on other sites. You can opt out of almost all advertising cookies by updating your preferences on www.youronlinechoices.com or www.aboutads.info. Opting out of advertising cookies won't stop you seeing adverts, just that they won't be tailored specifically to you.
Can Cookies be Blocked?
If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions.  However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, this may alter your access and use of some of the pages and features on our website.

How We Protect Personal Data
We take appropriate security measures by maintaining certain administrative, technical, and physical measures to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal data in our control.

in pursuit of a legal action;
to detect and monitor fraud; or
for the performance of a task in the public interest.
Right to Restrict Processing of your Personal Data
At your request, we will limit the processing of your personal data if:
you dispute the accuracy of your personal data;

Right to Withdraw Consent
You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time.  If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our collecting, using and sharing of your personal data up to the point in time that you withdraw your consent.  Even if you withdraw your consent, we may still use your information that has been fully anonymized and does not personally identify you.

International Transfer of Personal Data
Personal data provided to us by users outside of the United States (“U.S.”) may be transferred to other countries such as the U.S., where data protection laws may differ from those of your home country.  By providing us with your information you acknowledge that your information will be transferred to the U.S. and processed on servers in the U.S.  However, all reasonable steps will be taken to protect your privacy in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.
