At different times, blackfridaynewstoday.com may collect several types of information about you. Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form.
First, we or our partners or advertisers may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer – but not you – to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser’s preference options, but if you do so you may not be able to utilize some services properly.
Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our site. Your IP address is a number that identifies a computer which accesses the Internet. This address is used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your Internet service provider and the geographic location of your IP address. blackfridaynewstoday.com may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries.
Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Again, blackfridaynewstoday.com uses this information on an aggregate basis, in this case making sure we can support overall visitor traffic and service performance.
Fourth, at specific times we may ask you to provide us with personal information to enable you to register for a service or to enter a sweepstakes. You may also provide personal information if you write us feedback email. This information may include but is not limited to your name and email address. You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service, offer you personalized content, or respond to your feedback.

To use certain services on the site, it may be necessary to enter information that then goes to our partner and is not kept by blackfridaynewstoday.com.

If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data collection practices of one of our content partners, please contact that partner directly.
3. What does blackfridaynewstoday.com do with the data it collects?
Whenever blackfridaynewstoday.com collects data, the data is intended to tailor or improve the experience of visitors to our site. From the data collected we can customize content and advertising based on the user’s preferences. We may use information from cookies to differentiate between unique users, personalize the site for each unique user, to control the frequency of individual advertisements directed to individual computers, and other purposes. In all cases, personally identifiable information is not shared with our advertisers, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.
We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. It’s the way we can make sure our service is consistently available to you.
If you register for a service or to enter a sweepstakes, we may use the information we collect to provide the service to you or send communications regarding the sweepstakes. We may also send a newsletter by email to our users who opt to receive such emails. It is our policy to send these emails only to users who give us permission to do so.

We also may disclose your personal information (including without limitation IP addresses) to a third party if the law or legal process requires it, to protect the rights or property of blackfridaynewstoday.com or others, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy.
We may disclose certain non-personally identifiable information about you to advertisers or other third parties to present you with targeted advertisements.
