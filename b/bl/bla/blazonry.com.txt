**Your privacy is important to us.
At blazonry.com we have a few fundamental principles that we incorporate into our privacy policy.
**
We don’t ask for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your age, gender or income level for no good reason.)
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
We don’t store information on our server unless required for the on-going operation of our services.
This privacy policy describes what personal information is collected and how it is used.
Routine Information Collection
Like most website operators, our web server software collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. This non-personally identifying information can help us troubleshoot problems and understand how visitors use this website. The information is useful for routine administration and maintenance purposes.
Also typical of website server software, our logs collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses which could potentially identify persons. We do not use such information to identify visitors and do not disclose such information.
Ads
Ads appearing on this website may be delivered to users by advertising partners who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
