Black Diamond Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us at Black Diamond. We understand that you provide private information in the course of doing business with us online, by mail and by telephone. So that you understand how we operate to protect this information, the following is a description of our policies on collecting and protecting the information you provide to us. Other information related to the terms of use of this Website are also provided.
Your Personal Information
Personal Information is gathered by Black Diamond for the sole benefit of Black Diamond. Black Diamond does not sell, rent or provide your "Personal Information" to third parties, except as described below. Personal Information as used herein refers to data and facts about you which include, but are not limited to, your name, age, address, email address, financial information (account or credit card numbers), income level, phone number, etc. Personal Information is personal to you in that it belongs to you and identifies who you are. There are a variety of pathways, electronic and otherwise, by which any single element of these data can point to you personally. Personal Information does NOT include your IP Address as defined below. Personal Information is generally kept for Black Diamond business which is primarily used to assist you in your current or future communications and/or transactions or in analyzing sales trends.
Personal Information is primarily obtained from a form required to be completed when customers request information, products or services, including subscribing to our email list.   Personal Information that is collected by Black Diamond is used to bill the user for products and services, and to ship those products. Personal Information is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material to our customers. Personal Information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the directions in those mailings.
Black Diamond may use online surveys which ask visitors for Personal Information which usually includes contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We would potentially use Personal Information gathered from such surveys to send the user promotional material from Black Diamond.  Black Diamond may also run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for selected Personal Information such as contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We would potentially use Personal Information gathered from such contests to send users promotional material from Black Diamond. The customer's Personal Information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. when someone wins a contest.). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
Cookies and IP Addresses
Black Diamond also collects, uses, and monetizes IP Addresses. An IP Address is a convention of the Internet Protocol that identifies your "virtual" address on the internet. This IP Address is not personal to you and does not identify any of your Personal Information. All devices connected to a network have an IP Address permitting communication to and from the device. If you connect to the Internet from your computer, then you have an IP Address that looks something like this: 209.17.654.152. In the simplest possible terms, your IP Address contains no data that identifies you as a person. It is only a logical address allowing you to connect to others and others to locate your computer. An IP Address can be used variously as set forth herein. We could potentially use an IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. The IP Address may be used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We may use cookies for other purposes such as site personalization as well. You can reject cookies and still use the Black Diamond site, however, it will disable the ability for the site to recognize your cart, your account and any personalization efforts.
Black Diamond may monetize or otherwise provide anonymous IP Addresses to third parties. Black Diamond sometimes employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such may include hosting our website, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, retargeted advertising, analyzing data, etc. These third parties have access only to IP Addresses, no Personal Information is provided to them.
