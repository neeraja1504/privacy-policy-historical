A message from the owners: Simply put, we will not EVER sell or rent your contact info, and we will always do everything humanly possible to ensure the safety of your information. Pinky Promise. <3
Now, for the detailed info:

Any personal information collected will not be sold, rented or leased, and will only be shared within the Blame Betty and its affiliate companies (the “Blame Better Group of Companies”).
While using our website, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information (your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number). We use this information to complete your transaction and to apply for access to certain special features and functions of the website.
Information Collected
We collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information.
Your personal information may be used in a number of different ways. For example, to:
Fulfill your requests for products, services, or information
Provide customer service
Administer contests or promotions
Offer new products
Measure and improve the effectiveness of website and/or marketing endeavors
Tailor our on-line or in-store offerings to your preferences.
The personal information collected may include your name, mailing/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and IP address. Customers can always choose not to provide us with their personal information; however, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information requested.
