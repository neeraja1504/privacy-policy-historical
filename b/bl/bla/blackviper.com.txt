Introduction
I am not a lawyer, nor do I claim to be.
What you will find here is plain, easy to understand English. At least, I hope that it is.
Agreement
By using this site for whatever purpose you intended, you agree to abide by the rules set forth on this page.
If you do not agree, please leave and do not access my domain again.
Network
At my discretion, I reserve the right to allow and disallow IP addresses and clients/hosts access to my domain at any time. This will never happen “randomly.” After reviewing the server logs, I may decide that traffic directed to my domain is hostile and will be blocked at the IP or domain level. Access to my information is a privilege, not a right, and abuse will not be tolerated.
Copyright
Update on April 13, 2015:
In order to give back to the internet community and an effort on my part to reach my goal, I will state this:
If I reach my GoFundMe campaign goal of $36,000 US , I will release all content posted on www.blackviper.com, to include all images and text, past present and future , into the  public domain.
This means, I will not claim any Copyright on any and all images, including my install guides, or any text that I have drafted for Windows Services!
This action, I feel, is the best way to give back to everyone that I have helped as well as, I feel, an amount of money I never, ever would have thought possible to earn with my “hobby” website.
I thank you, in advance, for your generosity!

Privacy
My policy is simple: I will not show or make money from your private information, such as your E-Mail address. The only disclosure exception would be unless a legal authority, meaning local, California, US Federal Court, foreign office or other official directs it.
I may take selected quotes from an E-Mail that was directed into my inbox and repost it on my domain. However, without your permission, I will not say “where” or “whom” that quote came from. This is to protect the innocent as well as the guilty.
Standard HTTP server logs are maintained and contain data, such as requesting IP address, “referer,” (sic) OS and browser information. I may archive this data forever.
If you are so generous as to give money or items via PayPal or USPS, the information collected by these services and publicly viewed is beyond my control and cannot be protected by me. However, any personal data that is viewed by me and under my control will not be shared with anyone else.
