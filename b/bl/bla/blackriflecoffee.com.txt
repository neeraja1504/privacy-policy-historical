Except to the extent we combine information we receive from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with Black Rifle Coffee Company-Collected PI, in which case Black Rifle Coffee Company will treat the combined information as Black Rifle Coffee Company-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see Section 1(c)), data obtained by Black Rifle Coffee Company from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to Black Rifle Coffee Company’s limitations regarding Black Rifle Coffee Company-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on Black Rifle Coffee Company by the third party, if any.  Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with Black Rifle Coffee Company, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.

9.              Children’s Privacy.
The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age.

This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that Black Rifle Coffee Company does not control.
10.           Accessing and Changing Information.
Black Rifle Coffee Company may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to correct or update some of the Black Rifle Coffee Company-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account information). You may contact us at customerservice@blackriflecoffee.com to request that we delete some of the Black Rifle Coffee Company-Collected PI. Black Rifle Coffee Company will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in Black Rifle Coffee Company’s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from Black Rifle Coffee Company’s databases (California minors see Section 9) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter.  Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
11.           choices:  TRACKING AND Communications OPTIONS.
A.             Tracking Technologies Generally. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.  Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage ( e.g. , most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.  To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.  Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit.  Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many online services, Black Rifle Coffee Company currently does not alter Black Rifle Coffee Company’s practices when Black Rifle Coffee Company receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com, but Black Rifle Coffee Company is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information.  Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our web site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser ( ** www.ghostery.com** ), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.  Black Rifle Coffee Company is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms.   For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
B.             Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.  You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their web sites or tailor their online ads for you.”
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs.  Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“ DAA ”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads).  Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”).
