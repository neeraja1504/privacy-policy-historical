Privacy Policy - Blackhawk Network

Introduction and Scope of Practices.
Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates (“Blackhawk,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) care about your personal information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we, use this data, disclose the personal information (which includes “personal data” as defined under applicable EU and other data protection laws) we collect about you, and the rights you have regarding such data.  This Policy applies to the personal information Blackhawk collects about users of our websites (including www.blackhawknetwork.com), mobile applications, and the services and features therein (together the “Sites”), as well as the data we collect in providing our services (the “Services”) and when individuals communicate with us about our Sites and Services, whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or other means. When we act as a data processor on behalf of another controller, we collect, use, and disclose certain personal information only under the controller’s instruction, and our processing of your personal information is subject to their instructions and privacy policies.
Please note that links to third-party websites are subject to the third-parties’ privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Blackhawk’s Services are offered through third-parties, such as banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third-parties’ policies will govern their use of the personal information they process about their customers.
Personal Information We Collect
We collect personal information directly from you, through third parties, or automatically through our Sites and related to our Services, subject to applicable laws as set out below. Where the personal information we collect is needed to comply with law, or to enter into or perform an agreement with you, we will inform you at the time of such data collection. If we cannot collect this data, we may be unable to on-board you as a client or provide products or services to you.

When you submit online forms, participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or sweepstakes, join online chat discussions or post on a blog, request customer support, or submit testimonials, we collect your personal information, such as contact information, and other information you choose to share. Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

If you do, you might not be able to use certain features, especially when we use location-based information to prevent fraud.
Personal Information We Collect from Third-Parties. Sometimes, we may collect personal information from third-party sources. For example, subject to applicable law, we may confirm your address with the postal service or we may receive personal information about you from our clients who use our Services. Similarly, if our users choose to send a gift to their friend through our Sites, we will ask for the friend’s name and contact details.
Certain websites also may offer a referral service where users may refer other people they know to our Services, subject to restrictions under applicable local laws. If you choose to use our referral service to tell your friends about our Services, we will provide you with a referral code and signup instructions that you can share with your friends. Where permitted by local law, we conduct such referrals on an opt-out basis. If personal information about you has been provided to us and you want us to delete it, you may email us at privacy@bhnetwork.com.

We do not sell your personal information to third-parties.
Affiliated Blackhawk Companies
We disclose personal information among our affiliated and subsidiary companies in furtherance of the purposes set out in this Policy; their processing of your personal information is subject to this Policy. **  **

We disclose your personal information to certain companies that provide services to us and on our behalf and subject to our written instructions, such as shipping payment, hosting, and other support services; these companies may be located in the EU, the United States, and other jurisdictions.
Clients and Partners

These partners will be identified when you sign up, and we will obtain your consent in jurisdictions where this is required (and not other legal basis applies). Your personal information collected in such cases will be owned and controlled by both Blackhawk and the partner as independent data controllers. This Policy governs only Blackhawk’s use of such data. The partner’s own privacy policy governs its use of the data.

Some products offered in conjunction with banks have unique data sharing agreements. Where relevant, Blackhawk will make available to you short privacy notices of each product’s sharing policies on its website.

You will continue to receive ads on the sites you visit, but the ad networks from which you have opted out will no longer target ads to you based upon your activities on other sites. Please note, however, that these opt-out mechanisms are cookie based; so, if you delete cookies, block cookies or use another device, your opt-out will no longer be effective. For more information, go to www.aboutads.info.
For more information, and to opt out of interest based ads from many ad networks, see our Cookie Policy. Note, if you delete cookies or change devices, your opt-out may no longer be effective.
Social Media Widgets
Our Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our website (“Widgets”). Please refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third-party websites or services to find out more about the collection, use, and disclosure of your information through such features. We will comply with any legal obligations placed on the use of these technologies by certain jurisdictions, which may affect how these Widgets function.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented safeguards designed to protect the personal information submitted to us. Please note that no data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any personal information that we process.
Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and up to a period of no longer than seven (7) years, unless the period is required to be different under applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also further retain and use your personal information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, and enforce our agreements.
Image Submissions and Public Directories
Some of our websites offer you the ability to upload your own image to be used to create a personalized product. You may have the option to make these images available in publicly-accessible directories. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. You may request removal of your personal information at any time.
Your Rights
Certain countries and regions, including the European Union, have enacted laws that provide for privacy rights for individuals located in the EU. Regardless of your location and jurisdiction, Blackhawk may at its sole discretion choose to extend these rights to all individuals, and to comply with requests as detailed below. We do not charge for these services but in certain cases we may require further proof of your identity or ask you to clarify the scope and nature of your request if it is unclear. Where you are entitled to a right, we will respond to your request within the timeframe set out by law, or where we provide answers on a voluntary basis within a reasonable timeframe.
Please note that we only respond directly to you in cases where we are the controller of your personal information. Where we are acting as a data processor on behalf of a client or partner, we will forward your request to the client or partner who is the data controller of your personal information.
Access, Rectification, Portability and Deletion
You have the right to access, rectify (correct), or delete your personal information held by us or may ask for a restriction of processing. You may also have the right to ask for an overview or copy of your personal information or to request that certain of your personal information be exported to you or to another provider where technically feasible (data portability).  On some of our Sites, you may access, rectify, or delete your personal information by making the change directly on your account page.  You may also make these requests by sending an email to privacy@bhnetwork.com or by sending your request by postal mail to the address below.
Please note that there are some limitations to these rights.  For example, we will not be able to delete your personal information if we are required by law to keep it or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you. Similarly, access to your personal information may be refused if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. If we cannot fulfill your request, we will inform you about why we cannot comply with your request.
Withdrawal of Consent
Where we process your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Object to Processing
You have the right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds, where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal information.   If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.  Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.
Object to Marketing
You have the right to object to our use of your personal information (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal information to invite you to our promotional events.
Right to Lodge a Complaint
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.
To exercise your rights email privacy@bhnetwork.com (or contact us as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section below).  Please keep in mind that certain services will not be available if you withdraw your consent, or otherwise delete or object to our processing of certain personal information. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law, and we will inform you if we do not intend to comply with your request.
Protecting Children’s Privacy Online
