Cookies. In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, WORLDWIDE may use temporary "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is "name@xyz.com," the cookie collects the "xyz.com" portion of your e-mail address) and the date and time you accessed this Web site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not.

We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your membership account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
We also may use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log in to your membership account. In addition, we use cookies to process our referral program. Our cookie files are encoded so that your e-mail address and other information can only be interpreted by WORLDWIDE. We may, however, share cookie information regarding whether or not a certain user is already registered with WORLDWIDE with certain merchants, partners and third-parties with whom we have an official relationship.
In order for certain applications on WORLDWIDE's websites to function properly, if at all, it is necessary for your computer to accept cookies.
