Privacy Policy
Bloomspot Inc. takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit or use Bloomspot.com or our mobile application (collectively, the "Site"), as well as the information that we receive from partner companies or other third parties. Please read this notice carefully.
Personal Information
In order to supply you with our e-mail services, we need your e-mail address. We collect your e-mail address when you provide it to us. In some cases, so that we may provide you with additional services, we may also request other personal information, such as your name, geographical location, and telephone number. We will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for their marketing purposes without your express permission. We may, however, share your personal information (with our third party suppliers and others) for the purpose of delivering our e-mails and the Bloomspot service to you or as required, or allowed, by law. We may also share your personal information with our merchant partners when sharing this information may help our merchants fulfill a particular Bloomspot offer you’ve purchased. For example, we may share your personal information with merchants if the particular offer involves travel. And we may share your personal information in connection with a corporate change at Bloomspot, such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets.
Non-Personal Information
We may also request non-personal information, such as annual income, buying preferences, or age, though providing this information is optional. We may use these data to improve our Site and/or to customize your experience at our Site so that we can show you content that we think you might be interested in, according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers who are interested in advertising through the emails we send out or on our Site. When we do share this information, we will share it in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.
Usage Information
In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, we (and/or our service providers) may also collect information about subscribers' use of our emails and our Site. This information is used to better understand how the services we provide are being used so that we can continually improve them. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend using Bloomspot.com or our mobile application, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go when they leave Bloomspot. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and more efficiently deliver our service.

We may collect information such as unique device identifiers for your mobile device, your screen resolution and other device settings, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device. In some cases, we may ask your permission before collecting information through mobile channels. For example, we typically ask you to enter location data or give us permission to access location data that is associated to your device.
