Intra-Group Personal Data Protection Statement
The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. and its affiliates (“Bloomberg Industry Group”) are committed to compliance with their privacy obligations in the United States and throughout the world. This Intra-Group Personal Data Protection Statement (“Statement”) sets out the privacy principles Bloomberg Industry Group follows with respect to personal information that it transfers from the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland (collectively, “EU”) to the United States (“U.S.”).
The relevant Bloomberg Industry Group companies have entered into an Intra-Group Personal Data Protection Agreement (“IGA”) in order to ensure that responsibility for personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S. is clearly identified. The parties to the IGA are considered as data controllers, or data controller and data processor under applicable law.
As relevant Bloomberg Industry Group companies are located in the U.S., the group companies involved in the processing shall be known as a Data Exporter and a Data Importer respectively, although there may be more than one company involved in the processing of personal information.
The IGA incorporates unchanged EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses for controller to controller, and controller to processor transfers, and the relevant Data Exporter and Data Importer will abide by these EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses where personal information is transferred to or accessed from Bloomberg group companies in the U.S.
