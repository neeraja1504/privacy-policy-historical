Itâ€™s BLOGMAS.COM policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, BLOGMAS.COM collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, BLOGMAS.COM may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
BLOGMAS.COM also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. BLOGMAS.COM does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to BLOGMAS.COM choose to interact with BLOGMAS.COM in ways that require BLOGMAS.COM to gather personally-identifying information.
