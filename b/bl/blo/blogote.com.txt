Privacy Policy
This page provides a clear notice of the privacy principles we follow. At Blogote, you are our visitor, and it’s extremely important for us to keep your privacy intact. This is the Privacy Policy document written just for you.
Here, we outline the types of personal information we receive and collect through you. If you require more information or have any questions to ask, feel free to drop your message on our email ID. Click here to email us.
Key Principles We Follow:
Like every other website out there, we have our own set of principles we follow.
Transparency:
We write pages like this one for you to keep everything transparent between us. This Privacy Policy document has everything you need to know. Apart from revealing the information we collect from you, we also share the practices employed by our online advertisers.
Choice:
We give our users the freedom to do anything at Blogote. As a user, you can go to the main homepage, read our popular articles, or even leave a comment. Again, it’s up to you to share your real name and email address.
Security:
We use plugins to make sure our blog is hack-proof. We use Knownhost, our web hosting provider, to regularly check our servers for issues and fix them as soon as possible.
What Data is Collected?
Here’s what we collect from every visitor:
Minor Details
Information like your IP address, type of browser, Internet Service Provider, exiting page, landing page, number of clicks, your movement around the site and other demographic information. All this information will be automatically stored on our log files. Many website does this — we are no different.
However, the information doesn’t reveal your name, address or any kind of personally identifiable information.
We use this information to improve our site. Say, for instance, a lot of people are using Chrome browser to visit Blogote.com. We will then make sure our blog loads faster and is not broken on Chrome. If you see more US visitors than UK or Indian visitors, we will cover more news for the US crowd. As we mentioned earlier, this helps us improve Blogote and capture more visitors.
Cookies and Web Beacons
No cookies from us, which means all of your personal information will always be with you. We don’t store or retrieve any of your personal information. Our advertisers, however, use cookie (more information below).
DoubleClick Cookie
Google uses cookie. As a third-party vendor, they serve ads on our site. These cookies enables Google to serve ads to our sote based on their interests of users.
If you don’t want Google to store cookie, and if you want complete privacy, please follow this URL: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html
Similar to Google, there are other advertising and media partners who will use cookies and web beacons on Blogote. For now, though, Google Adsense is our only advertising partner. We also have an “advertise on Blogote” page for our new advertisers — this is direct selling and they won’t store any cookie on your computer.
The way these third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology amazes us. The place their advertisement on our site and the links that appears on Blogote will automatically detect the type of browser used by the user. It can also receive the IP address and minor details as mentioned earlier.
These companies will measure the success and effective of advertisement and tweak it further to personalize them just for you. So, let’s say, you are going through any of these Apple articles, then chances are you will be seeing ads relevant to the article.
Blogote.com doesn’t have any control over these ad networks’ cookies. We use third-party advertisers.
Although we are not using any other ad networks, but if you believe you require complete privacy, please contact third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices. Many of these ad networks have an opt-out option. Once you have chosen to not allow them to access minor details, they will stop mining information.
You may also disable cookies, if you wish to. Every browser — be it Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc. — comes with a cookie management feature. You can Google for more information, as all the browsers have this option hidden somewhere in the menu. You may also have a look at the browsers’ respective websites to get a clear picture on disabling cookies.
