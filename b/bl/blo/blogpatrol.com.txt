Privacy Policy | Free Blog Counters and Stats by BlogPatrol.com
BlogPatrol.com : Privacy Policy
We will never give, sell, or rent your email address to anyone else. We will only ever email you in relation to your account with BlogPatrol. Period.
The information collected by BlogPatrol about your site visitors is for your use and information only. Therefore, we will never give, sell, or rent your statistics and/or account information to anyone else without your consent.
If you use BlogPatrol for any illegal purpose, then you forfeit the protections of our privacy policy.
If you wish to make your BlogPatrol statistics private , please select the checkbox labeled "Password-protect my stats reports so that they do not appear on Google search results" option in your account settings. Private statistics do not appear in Google or other search engine results.
Many users like to share their site statistics with the public , so they do not "password protect" their BlogPatrol accounts. Public statistics are indexed and searchable by Google and other search engines.
Public statistics can also easily be shared by emailing or bookmarking the unique URL of one's BlogPatrol account. For example, one can email or bookmark the unique URL of our demo stats account.
Also, public statistics have the View link after the blog URL on the BlogPatrol Top Blogs  rankings page; private statistics do not.
An important distinction is that making your stats public allows others access to your stats reports, but NOT to any of your account information, particularly username and email address.
Converting from public stats to private stats will prevent the public from viewing your current statistics, but it will not affect the cached results stored by search engines. Over time, search engines may remove cached results of private stats pages, but BlogPatrol.com cannot control the activities of Google or any other search engines.
Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy or your free blog counter.
