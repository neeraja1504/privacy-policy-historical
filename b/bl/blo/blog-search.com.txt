With the exception of auto-response messages which are sent at the time of blog submission and which contain important confirmation details regarding your blog listing, you may remove yourself from any or all other notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes at least 2 methods to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you encounter problems in this regard, contact inquiry[at]blog-search.com. Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 24 hours.
