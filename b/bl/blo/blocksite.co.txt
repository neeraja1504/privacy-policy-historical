This Privacy Policy is provided to make important disclosures on how or why we collect, share and use our users’ information. Our users’ privacy is important to us. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our BlockSite Product and use it to make informed decisions.
By using the BlockSite Product or Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the BlockSite Product or Website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is part of our End User License Agreement and, to the extent that the processing of personal data is based on consent (see below) , is a legally binding agreement between you and the Company. Definitions herein shall have the same meaning as defined therein. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the BlockSite Product or Website.
**IF YOU OBJECT TO THESE TERMS PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE BLOCKSITE PRODUCT OR SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.     **
What Information Do We Collect?
The information we collect includes non-identifiable information which may be made available or gathered via the user’s use of the BlockSite Product and, where applicable and enabled by users of the mobile app, via the Android accessibility service (“ Non-Personal Information “). This Non-Personal Information is cleaned and scrubbed on your device – prior to being sent to our servers and prior to any other use – for the purpose of removing information that could be used to identify you. As such, we are not aware of and cannot determine the identity of the user from which the Non-Personal Information is collected.
Non-Personal Information collected through your use of the browser extension includes:
Browsing history information (URLs/domains visited)
Internet Protocol address – but note that we permanently delete and hash the last portion of your Internet Protocol address before storing it, thus preventing us from having the ability to use it to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you.
Non-Personal Information collected through your use of the mobile app includes:
Android
Device information (operating system version, device model name, screen size, and mobile network code)
Browser type
List of installed apps (app name, app ID, installation and update date, version, whether app is a system app, whether app is on home page)
App usage (including duration of use) – but note that we do not collect data from within the installed apps, but rather solely aggregated data concerning use itself
Browsing history information (URLs/domains visited, bookmarks, and the dates, times and durations of visits)
Internet Protocol address and device ID – but note that we permanently delete and hash the last portion of the Internet Protocol address before storing it, and we permanently encrypt and hash the device ID, thus preventing us from having the ability to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
iOS
We do not currently automatically collect data through your use of the iOS mobile application.
Such Non-Personal Information is processed for the purposes described in the “How Is the Data Used?” section hereunder.
We may disclose or share this Non-Personal Information with third parties as specified below and solely if applicable.
We do not collect from you any individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (“ Personal Information “) except as may be voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, such as your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties.
How is the Data Used?
We collect your information during your access or use of the BlockSite Website or the BlockSite Product as detailed above, and use that information to block your access to certain sites based on parameters you define and control (the “ Services ”). We use that information based on our legitimate interests in promoting and improving the BlockSite Product and our services, on the necessity of such information for the provision of the BlockSite Product and our services where applicable (as described in this Privacy Policy) or, where permitted under applicable law, on the implied consent that you provide by using the BlockSite Product, or by requesting support, registering for the BlockSite Product, or through your use of the various forums and blogs available within the website.
In practice, in order to provide the BlockSite Product and the Services, we need to scan the webpages you browse, and we need to retrieve the apps you are trying to open. Meaning, we use the data collected from you, as detailed and specified above, and transmit it to our servers for the purpose of enabling the BlockSite Product and in order to know when and where there is content, a website or an app to block. Thus, the processing of Non-Personal Information in this context is necessary for a user-facing feature, namely the provision of the Services as described above. Accordingly, without access to such information, some or all of the site-blocking would not work. You acknowledge and agree that by using the BlockSite website and by downloading and using the BlockSite Product, you request that we provide you with the Services.
We also use Non-Personal Information, aggregated information or statistics regarding user browsing behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, the BlockSite Product in the form of aggregated data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports, which do not describe or identify any individual user.
How is the Data Shared?
We do not share any Personal Information collected from you with third parties or any of our partners. We may disclose information you submitted if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:
(i) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request;
(ii) to enforce our policies (including our policies and agreements), including investigations of potential violations thereof;
(iii) investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues;
(iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims;
(v) to prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, yourself or any third party; or
(vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal rights.
Note that we may also appoint third-party service providers, or have certain services provided by one of our affiliated companies, operating under our instructions, who may need access to your information in connection with their services on our behalf. Transfers of your Personal Information will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
We will take the necessary steps to ensure that international transfers of personal data (including Personal Information) meet all requirements under applicable data protection laws. When personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“ EEA “) is transferred outside the EEA, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that the transfer of such data provides sufficient safeguards, and you may exercise your rights, where applicable, to receive information on such transfer mechanism.
