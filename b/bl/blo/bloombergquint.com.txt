Your continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to all such changes.
(c) How we use Cookies
We collect information on our users through registration and the use of the Website, through cookies, where you choose to disclose data in postings, and when you enter sales promotion and competitions.
We use cookies for a number of reasons:
(i) To gather statistics : We track how many ‘unique users’ we have and how often they visit our Website. We track how often different pages of our Website are visited and which countries our visitors come from. Accurate statistics enable us to sell advertising and continue to provide a top quality service to you. The information collected by cookies does not personally identify you; it includes general information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings of browsing on the Website and your location.
(ii) To track advertising response : Third parties generate statistical cookies to track ad impressions and click-through rates. Some cookies enable us to show the adverts that might be more relevant to you, to control the number of times you see them, and measure how effective the ad campaign has been.
(iii) To advertise : We also utilise cookies to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our advertisements on sites across the Internet. In addition, third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together to inform, optimise, and serve advertisements based on someone’s past visits to our Website.
(iv) Flash cookies may be used to store user preferences for media player functionality and without them some video content may not render correctly.
By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described.
(d) Types of cookie that may be used
The following types of cookie are used on this site. We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
(i) First Party Cookies
These are our own cookies, controlled by us and used to provide information about usage of our site.
(A) Personalisation cookies
These cookies are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at the Website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and the path you take through the Website). These are used to recommend content we think you'll be interested in based on what you're looked at before.
(B) Analytics cookies
These cookies monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
(C) Our own ad serving and management cookies
We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers.
As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (i.e. it is not linked to you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - so we could show you an advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising. It will mean merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
(D) Site management cookies
These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).
(ii) Third Party Cookies
These are cookies found in other companies’ internet tools which we are using to enhance our Website, for example Google, Facebook, Twitter, Zeotap, Comscore, IIFL have their own cookies, pixel tags, etc. which are controlled by them. We have no control on such cookies. The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies and the Company has no access to read or write these cookies, other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all.
(A) Third-party service cookies
