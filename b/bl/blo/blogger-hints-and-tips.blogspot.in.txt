This article describes the personal information that Blogger-Hints-and-Tips collects, and how it is used.
Introduction
All web servers, including the ones that host Blogger-Hints-and-Tips, store some information about visitors, including (at least) IP address, browser and its configuration, the date and time of the visit and and details about how the visitor reached the site (from a referring page, or using what search-keywords).
This data is tracked for administration and maintenance purposes, and lets me know what articles readers are interested in. It is also used for administration and site-maintenance, and for promoting the site to potential advertisers. A key point is that it cannot personally identify visitors to this site, so is not considered as personal information.
