Privacy is of utmost importance at the Blockchain group of companies (“Blockchain”). We recognize the significance of protecting information which is stored on our computers or is intended to be stored on our computers and which relates to an individual. The data we protect are the “Personal Data” which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, sometimes called a data subject, and have made protecting privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data a fundamental component of the way we do business. This Privacy Policy informs you of the ways we work to ensure privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data. This policy describes the information we gather, how we use those Personal Data and the circumstances under which we disclose such information to third parties.
In this Policy “Services” means the Blockchain website, any feature provided by us via the website or any local application (mobile desktop or otherwise), including without limitation wallet services or blockchain information services, but excluding API services, which are governed by a separate agreement.
If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use the Services.

Questions and Complaints
1. Collecting of Personal Information
When you access or use the Services, we collect the following information:
Information you may provide to us: You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our website or through our app or by corresponding with us by phone, email or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use the Services and when you report a problem with the website or with our app. The information you give us may include your name, email address, virtual currency addresses, business card or other identifying document, mobile phone number, alias, password, mobile PIN code, and any other information you choose to provide.
Information we collect about you: With regard to each of your visits to our website or our app we automatically collect the following information:
Log Information: We log technical information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser and version you use, last access time of your wallet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to create the wallet and the most recent IP address used to access the wallet.
Device Information: We collect information about the mobile device you use to access our mobile application, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information, but this information is anonymized and not tied to any particular person.
Address Information: When you create a wallet through our Services, you may choose to generate a public and private key pair. When you log out of the wallet, we collect an encrypted file, that, if unencrypted, would contain these keys, along with your transaction history. When you enable notifications through your Account Settings, we will collect the unencrypted public key in order to provide such notifications. Under no circumstances do we ever collect an unencrypted private key from you, nor can we decrypt any wallet file data.
Information We Collect from Other Sources: We also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For instance:
When you log in to our support desk center via a third-party social media service, we collect information about your social media account in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media service, including your public profile, friend list and email address.
We use third-party services (e.g. Zendesk) co-branded as Blockchain but will do so with clear notices. Any third-party services may collect information as determined by their own privacy policies.
We also use "cookies" from time to time to help personalize your online experience with us.

We will process Personal Data collected through cookies in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you should receive a warning message with each cookie.

We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure they are being properly administered and remain effective and appropriate. Every member of Blockchain is committed to our privacy policies and procedures to safeguard Personal Data. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting your Personal Data to prevent individuals from reading these Data as they travel over the Internet.
