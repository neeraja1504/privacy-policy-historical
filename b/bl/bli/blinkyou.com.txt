Blinkyou Privacy Policy
LAST UPDATED: 03/12/2006
Protecting the privacy of all of our users (" Users ", " you " or " your ") is a dedicated commitment of Blinkyou.com and all of the services brought to you by Blinkyou.com (collectively, " Blinkyou ", " us " or " we "). This Privacy Policy (" Privacy Policy "), applies to all URLs and services provided under the Blinkyou name and in connection with the Blinkyou marks. It explains how Blinkyou treats personal information that we collect and receive on the Blinkyou website from our users and visitors.
Personal information is information about you that is not otherwise available to the public. As the words imply, this information personally identifies you. Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information.
You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies ONLY to the Blinkyou website, the Blinkyou URLs, and the services and features provided by Blinkyou. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that you visit before or after us, to the other third party services featured on the Blinkyou site, or to third party advertisers or affiliates (collectively, " Third Party Services "). Please be sure to familiarize yourself with all of these Third Party Services� privacy policies. For your convenience ONLY, we have listed links to third party privacy policies for some of the parties that we do business with. However, not all Third Party Services may be listed.
Now that you know what this Privacy Policy covers, you may have the following questions:
