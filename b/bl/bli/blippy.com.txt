This Blippy privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through Blippy. This includes “Personal Information,” which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as “Anonymous Information,” which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
User Consent
By accessing or otherwise using Blippy, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.
Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not permitted under applicable law.
Regarding Children
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Blippy and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Blippy, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent’s or guardian’s permission to use Blippy.
Collection of Information
Personal Information that You Provide
In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Blippy. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Blippy, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Blippy, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Blippy, such as photos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to submit. Personal Information from Other Sources
We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, “Partners”) or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.
E-mail and E-mail Addresses
If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our “Report a problem” form through Blippy, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail and other information you provide. We may use this e-mail address to contact you. You may indicate your preference to stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.
Information Collected Via Technology
As you use Blippy, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Blippy you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Blippy and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Blippy to meet your special interests and needs.
An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Blippy.
Use and Disclosure of Information
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to Blippy, to improve Blippy, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of Blippy and to offer you additional information and functionality from us at your request.
We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Blippy and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.
Additionally, we may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to you. Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Blippy. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.
We may share some or all of your Personal Information with Blippy affiliated companies that are under a common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.
In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.

Despite your indicated email marketing preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding Blippy, including, for example, administrative and transactional confirmations, and notices of updates to our Privacy Policy if we choose to provide such notices to you in this manner.
You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your Personal Information, please contact us.
