Privacy Policy | Blippar
Last modified: 25th May 2018
Your privacy is important to us at Blippar.com Ltd (“Blippar”). When you use the Blippar Services, we will receive some information about you. When we talk about the Blippar Services, we mean the websites, apps, APIs, tools and other products, services and features offered by Blippar and linked to this privacy policy.
Some of the information we receive is Personal Data, which means it could be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person.
This policy is designed to explain to you what information about you, including Personal Data, Blippar collects in providing the Blippar Services, how that information is used and shared and the control you have over that information.
Data processed by Blippar
App users
We do not ask that you set up an account to use the Blippar app to explore the world around you. However, when you point your device and click to scan, or ‘blipp’, an object, we will collect and store information about you. The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is based on Blippar’s legitimate interest in serving you the correct content as part of an AR experience (also called a ‘blipp’) and continuously improving our Services.
This includes digital images of the people or items you blipped, your GPS location, IP address and Advertising ID. We’ll never share that information with anyone outside of the Blippar Group.
It also includes information about how you have interacted with our Services and the blipps, such as the time and frequency of the interactions, dwell time and the devices and operating systems used to access the blipps, so we can understand more about the user journey.
If the blipp is connected to a client of ours, all information about blipp interactions is combined and shared with them in a way that doesn’t identify any individuals, so that they can better understand the performance of the blipps.
Sometimes, the blipp experience will be designed to request more Personal Data from you, such as your name and email address, usually in relation to promotional activity. In each case, the purpose of the data collection and processing will be explained to you beforehand and you will have the option of not providing the additional information.
The above information is also received by Blippar when you access a blipp through third party apps, via an API. Those third parties may decide to collect and send to us additional Personal Data; you can read more about that in their privacy policies.
Account holders
Users of Blippar’s tools, including the Blippbuilder suite of products, our Software Development Kit or Computer Vision APIs, will also sign up to a Hub account. We will obtain Personal Data from you to set up the account on your behalf, or you may provide the details via a form to set up the account directly.
We will use your name and email address to create your account profile and to communicate with you regarding the Services, if there are any technical or operational issues or updates which we think our account holders need to know about, or if we make any material changes to our Terms or this Privacy Policy.
We will also ask for the region you are in, so that we know where we will need to publish the content you create, which is stored on our platform. That content might include digital images of you or other people, which would constitute Personal Data.
The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is for the performance of the contract between us, under which we are delivering our Services to you.
If you provide your opt-in consent to receive marketing information from Blippar, we will also collect and process your name, email address, company and location details for the purpose of sending you tailored marketing information about Blippar products and services, regular newsletters, blog entries and industry updates. The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails.
When you interact with our customer support representatives or your account manager via email, telephone, or online, we collect personal data, such as your name, phone number, email address, IP address and contact preferences, information about the Blippar Services you are using, and any other information you volunteer. We also may create event logs to assist with diagnosing and resolving product or app performance-related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. The legal ground for processing information for this purpose is legitimate interests in providing you with quality customer and product support.
Other clients
Other Blippar clients, or prospective clients, may provide us with Personal Data, including name, email address, phone number and other contact information, in connection with the Blippar Services you are, or will be, receiving. The legal ground for process information for this purpose is for the performance of the contract between us, for these Services, or in preparation for entering into that contract. In the delivery of the Services, you might also provide us with content that contains Personal Data, such as digital images of individuals.
Transfer of personal data
Blippar is a global company which transfers Personal Data to other Blippar companies in other countries in order to deliver and maintain our Services.

By using Blippar Services, you consent to the hosting of your personal information on servers in both locations and the transfer of your Personal Data outside of the country it was collected.
