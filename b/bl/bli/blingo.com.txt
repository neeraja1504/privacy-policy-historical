PCH shares information concerning specific interests and needs of our Users with third parties in order to provide our Users with a more personalized and relevant web service.
User information is sometimes provided to our marketing partners in an aggregate and anonymized form that enables them to provide you with relevant offers without disclosing personally identifying information. In other cases, we may provide marketing partners with the information necessary to contact you directly through digital channels or the mail. PCH may use aggregated and anonymized User information to identify relevant third-party offers and content for User consumption, with or without sharing such information directly with a third-party marketing partner, and to match such offers and content to appropriate Users. PCH may also exchange, combine or acquire User information with third-party data cooperatives and from third-party data providers to help understand your needs and provide you with a more relevant online experience.
PCH shares User information with third-party service vendors such as e-mail service providers, content providers, data hygiene service providers or ad tech industry participants. These third parties are ordinarily prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.
