Once you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account for this purpose. That way, the same personalized advertising messages can appear on any device you sign in to with your Google Account.

Here, offers for specific target groups are played out based on a selection of general criteria, such as demographic characteristics, regions or interests. Quora also allows us to target ads based on your recent page views. For example, you may see ads and notices about our offers and content if you are interested in specific services, information, or offers at the online trade show. Here only general and technical information on accessed pages are evaluated. If you generally do not want to be tracked by Quora, you can prevent the storage of cookies at any time by your browser settings, which could be limited function.
The storage of "conversion cookies" is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.

Newsletter
Newsletter data
If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need an e-mail address from you, as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter are. Further data are not collected or only on a voluntary basis.
We use this data exclusively for the delivery of the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties. The processing of the data entered into the newsletter application form is based exclusively on your consent (Art.6 (1) (a) GDPR). Of course, you can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the already completed data processing operations remains unaffected by the revocation.
The data deposited with us for the purpose of obtaining the newsletter will be saved by us from the newsletter until your cancellation and deleted after the cancellation of the newsletter or you will ensure that you will not receive any further newsletters ("blacklisting"). Data stored for other purposes with us (eg e-mail addresses for logging on to our services) remain unaffected.
MailChimp / Mandrill
This website uses the services of MailChimp for sending newsletters (or mandrill for sending information relevant to the user). Provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 (USA).
MailChimp is a service with which, among other things, the dispatch of newsletters can be organized and analyzed. If you have entered data for the purpose of newsletter subscription (eg e-mail address), these will be stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA.
MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the United States designed to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.
With the help of MailChimp we can analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an e-mail sent with MailChimp, a file included in the e-mail (called web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This way you can determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is collected (eg time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information can be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. They are used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyzes can be used to better tailor future newsletters to the interests of the recipient.
If you do not want to be analyzed by MailChimp, you have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter message. Furthermore, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.
The data processing takes place on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO). You can revoke these at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of the already completed data processing operations remains unaffected by the revocation.
The data deposited with us for the purpose of obtaining the newsletter will be saved by us from the newsletter until you receive it and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of MailChimp after cancellation of the newsletter.
For details, see the privacy policy of MailChimp.

We also collect certain limited information, such as your zip code, mobile phone number and details of your transaction history. In addition, these payment service providers usually provide us with very limited information about you, such as the unique "token", which enables you to make further purchases using the data stored by the service providers, as well as your card type, expiration date and last four digits of the number.
