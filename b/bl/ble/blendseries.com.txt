Privacy Policy | one-tvs.com
This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect about you at one-tvs.com (the "Website") and how we use this information.
Collection of your one-tvs.com Information
Your "one-tvs.com information" includes certain technical information gathered or received when you use one-tvs.com. Some of the technical information that may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); Internet protocol address; information about the version of service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
While registering to use most of the one-tvs.com services is not required, there are a limited number of optional services (for example, comment on a tv-show) that require an "account". Registration functionality for one-tvs.com is provided by the one-tvs.com. If you choose to "Register an Account", you will need to register with and provide information to one-tvs.com. You will then obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by one-tvs.com (collectively, "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the one-tvs.com Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your registration process.
How Your one-tvs.com information is Used
Your one-tvs.com information is used:
to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through one-tvs.com;
to personalize the content provided to you;
to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
to conduct research about your use of one-tvs.com; and
to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.
Your one-tvs.com information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your one-tvs.com information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your one-tvs.com information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups of one-tvs.com users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.
If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as well as other information about you as a one-tvs.com user, may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe one-tvs.com is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to your one-tvs.com information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for one-tvs.com.
In the event that ownership of us or the one-tvs.com service was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your one-tvs.com information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your one-tvs.com information, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
