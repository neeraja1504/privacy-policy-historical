We will never share your contact information with another user without your consent.
Any personally identifiable information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page. If you continue to use the BlueServo service after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices. Please read this privacy policy to learn more about:
What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by BlueServo.

How to contact us.
1. Personal Information Collected
We collect your personal information in the following ways:
Registration
In order to become a BlueServo user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: name, and email address, and a password chosen by you.
Cookies
Like most web sites, BlueServo uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows BlueServo to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
Additionally, if you log out of the BlueServo site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the BlueServo site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, for greater customization of your user experience, Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use our website or services. BlueServo does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.
Web Beacons
We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to BlueServo users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. BlueServo may "target"some ads to users that fit a certain general profile - for example, "product managers in Texas."
To deliver these ads properly, BlueServo may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by BlueServo so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. BlueServo never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party.
Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the BlueServo web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave BlueServo. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the BlueServo service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
2. Uses of personal information
BlueServo Communications
BlueServo will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from BlueServo related to the proper functioning of your account. BlueServo may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information
Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by BlueServo Corporation from BlueServo users (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by BlueServo. This information can be utilized by BlueServo in such manner as BlueServo, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
Sharing Information With Third Parties
BlueServo takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.
We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including, without limitation, to prospective advertisers on BlueServo. We may segment our users by role. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on the site, please email info@BlueServo.com.
Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services

Legal Disclaimer
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Disclosures to others
We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a BlueServo corporation division or company and only after taking steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

You can also close your account through the BlueServo website. If you close your BlueServo account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information.

All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the BlueServo Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your request. To request that we close your account and remove your information from the BlueServo service, please send your request to info@BlueServo.com.
