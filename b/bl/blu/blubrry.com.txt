We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we receive information when you set up an account at RawVoice/Blubrry. We obtain this information so we can provide services to you.

Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to track user preferences or web pages visited while using a site, to identify the unique number of visitors to a website, and to verify whether or not a visitor is a repeat visitor.

Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about a user’s interactions with a website. Typically, the script is temporarily downloaded onto a computer from the host website’s server (or the server of a third-party service provider) and is active only while the visitor is connected to the site, then deleted or deactivated after that.
