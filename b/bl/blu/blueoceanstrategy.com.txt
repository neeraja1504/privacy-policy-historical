Statistical Logs Kept
In addition to any information you may affirmatively provide to BOS through on-line forms or otherwise, the Website is programmed to collect data about visitor traffic to the Web Site. BOS does not attempt to personally identify visitors to the Website. Instead we collect data to analyze in the aggregate to determine trends and improve our site. The following are some examples of the types of data we routinely collect:
• Internet address of computer
• Browser type
• Referring web page
• Date, time & duration of visit
As part of the registration process for our e-newsletter, we collect personal information. We use that information to send you the newsletters and information you’ve signed up for; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are correct and to check if you’re satisfied and get your feedback. We don’t rent or trade email lists with other organisations and businesses.
We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletter. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter. For more information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice. You can unsubscribe to general mailings at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.
