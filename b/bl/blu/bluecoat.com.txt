We do not rent, sell or lease this personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals.
Collection and Use of Information Obtained through Specific Programs
User Registration
Blue Coat collects personal information from you when you register to create a Blue Coat account. As part of the registration process, you are required to provide certain personal information, including your name, company name, email address, title, location, and phone number, industry, role and purchasing time frame. Blue Coat may use the information collected for several general purposes: to inform you about products, seminars and services Blue Coat believes may be of interest to you; to contact you if Blue Coat needs to obtain or provide additional information; and to verify the accuracy of Blue Coat’s records.
BlueTouch Online
Access to certain Blue Coat Web pages, including the Blue Coat’s BlueTouch Online pages, require a log in and a password and may further require the creation of a personal account, which requires the provision of your name, address, e-mail and phone number, as well as whether you are associated with a reseller or end user (and if an end user, the products used). The use of the BlueTouch Online pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those pages, may be governed by an agreement between Blue Coat and your employer as the end user of a Blue Coat product. The information obtained in connection with the creation of a personal account may be used by Blue Coat to: identify end users of Blue Coat products and to associate specific products (including models and serial numbers) with those end users; communicate with you regarding the provision of product support; verify compliance with the end user agreement; issue license keys; track software downloaded from BlueTouch Online pages; or to track usage of other applications available on those pages. The information obtained about you is maintained in a separate database and may be used to communicate with you about supporting your Blue Coat product and may also be used for the marketing purposes described below.
Marketing Programs
Blue Coat collects personal information from you when you provide such information in connection with participation in one of our marketing programs. Blue Coat may use this information, as well as information obtained through User Registration and BlueTouch Online, to communicate with you in connection with various marketing programs, including advertising, direct marketing, seminars and events and Web-based programs, including Webcasts and podcasts.

Such information includes your name, your address, your phone number, your email address, job preferences, experience, desired salary, relocation preferences, work authorization, security clearance, education, job skills and other information contained on your resume or curriculum vitae (CV). Blue Coat uses such information solely for consideration of your candidacy for employment, to communicate with you and to generate related correspondence, including offer letters and employment agreements.
Blue Coat currently uses, and may in the future use, a third party provider to host the software and storage system that collects and stores all data submitted by employment applicants. Blue Coat requires that such providers be certified under the Safe Harbor program operated by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The collection and storage of your personal data by any such third party provider is governed by the Privacy Policy of that provider.
Your submission of personal information or a resume through our Web site constitutes your consent to the collection, storage and use of that information, including in the United States, as described above.
Web Site Tracking
When you browse our Web site you do so anonymously, unless you have previously registered with us and have logged in. We do, however, use third party tools to track your anonymous activity on our Web site in order to collect information. We also use standard technologies, such as cookies and other HTML tools, to collect information about how you use our Web site and to record certain information. For example, we may record the IP address of visitors to our Web site and correlate that information to the company which is associated with that IP address. We do not attempt to identify individual visitors to our site.
We use cookies to provide a user-friendly registration and login process. A cookie is a small text file containing information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. A cookie cannot give us access to your computer or information beyond what you provide to us. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies; consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still use many features of the Blue Coat Web site.
If you have registered with us and are logged in, we can track your activity and relate it to your email address. As well, if you have explicitly registered with us for certain marketing programs, we can link your activity to the user profile created when you initially register and which is updated on subsequent visits.
Information Collected
By providing Blue Coat with your personal data, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, use and disclosure of your personal data as provided in this Privacy Policy. You may elect not to provide such information to Blue Coat, but then you may be unable to use certain Blue Coat services or obtain certain information. Blue Coat may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without notice. If Blue Coat changes this Privacy Policy, it will publish those changes on this Web page.
