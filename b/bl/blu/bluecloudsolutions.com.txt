Please help us keep your user account and personal information secure by using a  strong  (!) password and not sharing it with others or keeping it someplace where someone can find it.  We will never ask you for your password, so do not give it to someone claiming to be us if you are asked for it.

All purchases must be made by credit card, debit card, or payments via PayPal.  All billing related information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into a payment gateway provider’s database.  Such information is accessible only by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and they are required to keep that information confidential. After the completion of a transaction, all payment related information, such as credit card numbers, will not be stored on our servers.
