Data that we store and process on BLUF.com if you are a member
This is the information that we store about you, and how it is processed to provide the functionality of the BLUF.com website (“site”) and apps.
Your email address is used to help identify your BLUF.com account and to send you notifications about your account, or other email messages that you have chosen to receive.
Your profile text, tags, the locations you enter and other data that makes up your profile, such as club memberships, is stored and used to display your profile to other members, and to allow other members to search for profiles.
Your photos are stored in order that they may be displayed to other members alongside your profile details, or in lists of members (for example "Online now").
Messages you send to, and receive from, other members, or post in the BLUF forum or database are stored on our servers.
A record of updates to your account (including, but not limited to, travel plans, change of name, new photos added) is stored to enable the display of member activity ("Today on BLUF") and lists of members with recent updates.
A record of profiles you have visited is kept to enable you to view your history of profile views, and so that we can tell other members when you viewed their profile.
Your preferences are stored, to enable us to display the site in your preferred language, as well as other options, such as the number of members to display per page, the site colour scheme, order of displaying members and so on.
Your login, logout and last activity times for each session are stored in our database, to enable session management (for example, logging you off if you leave your computer).
The IP address from which you connect to BLUF.com may be stored, as part of our security checks.
The type of computer or software you use to connect to BLUF.com may be stored, and used to help us ensure the site and/or apps are compatible with as many members as possible, or to display information in the manner best suited to your device (including, but not limited to automatically selecting a language for you, based on information supplied by your web browser).
Other information may be stored and processed to provide the functions of the BLUF site and apps, for example, indicating if you are the author of an article, or are entitled to a BLUF card, or if you have given an app on one of your mobile devices permission to access BLUF.com.
If you have administrative privileges on BLUF.com, additional information will be stored to create an audit trail of administrative actions you have taken, such as editing event information, publishing a blog or magazine article, or sending a mailshot.
