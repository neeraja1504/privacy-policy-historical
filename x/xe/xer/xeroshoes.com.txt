Privacy - Xero Shoes
Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy
in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and make use
of personal information, and how the law affects and protects you.
The following outlines our Privacy Policy.
Feel The World, Inc., doing business as Xero Shoes, (“we”, “us”, “the Company”, “our”) is the controller and is responsible for your personal data. Our DPM (data privacy manager) is Steven Sashen, CEO. You can contact our DPM at support@xeroshoes.com or via mail at 100 Technology Drive, Suite 315, Broomfield, CO 80021.
We hope that if you have any questions, requests or complaints about our data collection and use and about this policy that you contact us first so that we may address any situation that arises.
Please note that should our site include links to third-party websites over which we have no control, that you read the privacy documents of those websites.
No SPAM!
If you share you email address with us for any reason we will not sell, rent, or
otherwise make your email address available to any third parties for any reason.
Nor will we barrage you with sales messages. By purchasing from us, you are
agreeing to receive emails about your order, about special events, and to receive
our newsletter.
Should you choose to stop receiving email from us, there will be clear instructions at
the bottom of each email for you to follow to “opt-out.” Emails about specific orders
(e.g. shipping confirmation) will not have opt-out instructions.

We may also collect, use, and share non-identifying “aggregate data” for any reason. This is information that is derived from the data above but is not deemed personal as it does not reveal your identity in any way. For example, aggregate data about the number or percentage of users who view a certain page or access a function or feature of our site or purchase certain products.

Third party data — e.g. data from publicly available sources such as analytics providers (e.g. Google), advertising networks such as Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, financial transactional data from payment services such as PayPal, etc.
Automated technologies — we may collect Technical data using server logs, or “cookies” that reside on our site or other sites using our cookies (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”). Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site, your IP address.
What Are Cookies?
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s computer asks your computer
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser
only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not
the cookies sent to you by other sites.
IP Addresses
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the
Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network
to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web
server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data”
so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
Email Information
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content
of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We
provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ
in the maintenance of information received online, mail and telephone.
How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?
Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering
our business activities, providing customer service and making available other
items and services to our customers and prospective customers.
Feel The World, Inc. will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you
visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, nor will
such information be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties
without the approval of the user at the time of collection.
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words,
when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection
of our legal rights.
Should we sell, transfer, or merge our business with a third-party, your data may transferred as part of that transaction. If that should occur, the third-party owners may use your data in the same manner described in this document. We will require third-parties to similarly treat and respect your data in accordance with the law. We will notify you should such a transaction occur.
Data security
We have security measures in place to protect your data from accidental loss, access, use, alteration, or disclosure. We limit the access to your data to employees, agents, contractors and other third-parties who have a business need for that data. They will only access this data per our instructions and subject to non-disclosure.
We will notify you and any necessary authorities should we suspect a data breach to have occurred.
Data retention
We will retain personal data only for as long as necessary for fulfilling the purposes for which is was collected and for satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.

Requesting access to your personal data
Requesting correction or updating of your data
Requesting removal of your personal data
Objecting to processing your personal data
Requesting restriction of processing your personal data
Requesting transfer of your personal data
Withdrawing consent
Should you wish to exercise any of these rights, contact us at support@xeroshoes.com
In order to comply, we may need to request specific information from you to confirm your identity, ensure your right to access your data or to exercise other rights. We do this to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to anyone who does not have the right to receive it. We may contact you to get further information so that we can provide an accurate and timely response to your request.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days, though it may take longer depending on the nature and quantity of your requests and the total requests received. Should we assess that the time to respond will exceed 30 days, we will notify you with updates to the status of your request.

you are a minor, you can use this site only in conjunction with permission and

How Do We Protect Your Information and Secure Information Transmissions?
Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason,
we request that you do not send private information to us by email. However,
doing so is allowed, but at your own risk. Some of the information you may enter
on our Web site may be transmitted securely via a secure medium known as Secure
Sockets Layer, or SSL. Credit Card information is never transmitted via email.
Feel The World, Inc. may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used
for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections
of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical
design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available
to all users, Feel The World, Inc. uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

notice. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the
future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under
this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy
Policy, without your prior consent.
