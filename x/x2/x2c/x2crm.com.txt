We will share with these companies only that personal information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in other countries. Your personal information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to X2Engine, and under the instructions of X2Engine, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.
IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
The Website has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.

HOW CAN I OPT-OUT FROM RECEIVING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS?
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.
