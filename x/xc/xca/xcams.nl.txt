The security of your password
The Data Processor takes all necessary precautions to ensure the secure storage of the password of the Member.
However, the security of this password also depends on its design.
Also, the Member is reminded that their password must be composed of at least 8 characters in order to be valid.
Blocking of multiple tries: account access temporarily suspended after several "captcha" failures
Mnemonic techniques make it possible to create complex passwords, such as:
keep only the first letters of the words of a sentence; for example, the phrase "One password is memorable!” becomes the password 1P@im!
putting a majuscule if the word is a noun (e.g. Password)
keeping punctuation symbols (e.g. !)
expressing numbers using figures from 1 to 9 (e.g. one ->1)
