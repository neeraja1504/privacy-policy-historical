CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Maritz may transfer your personal information to Maritz’s entities in the United States, or to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy that are located in various countries around the world.  By using Maritz’s Platform, or providing any personal information to Maritz, where applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage or such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.  When Maritz collects information in one country, and transfers it to another, to the extent possible it applies the same level of data protection required under the laws in the first country even when the data is in the second country.
Maritz safeguards and enables the global transfer of personal information in a number of ways.  The following describes some of the protections that are taken with regard to data originating from certain countries:
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield : Maritz adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework concerning the transfer of personal information from the European Union  and Switzerland to the United States. Accordingly, Maritz follows the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“ Privacy Shield Principles ”) with respect to all such data.  Maritz complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.  Maritz specifies in contracts with service providers that handle the personal information collected by Maritz that the personal information “may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with” the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy.  Those third parties agree to provide the same level of protection as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.  In certain situations, if a third party that receives personal information from Maritz takes an action that is contrary to the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Maritz will be liable for those actions unless it can prove that it was not responsible for causing them.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  Compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles may be limited, however, in certain cases to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements.  All Maritz personnel with access to personal information are obligated to familiarize themselves and comply with provisions of this Privacy Policy.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the Maritz certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ and search for the Maritz subsidiary or division.  A violation of Maritz’s commitment to EU-U.S. Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.  With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Maritz is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Maritz commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with questions or concerns about our use of personal information or our privacy policy should submit a written request to us using the information in the “Communications” section below.
If your question or concern is not satisfied through this process Maritz has further committed to refer unresolved EU-U.S. Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider located in the United States.  Information about how to file a complaint with JAMS related to our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program can be found at https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim.  The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.  Under certain circumstances, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.
Maritz commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.
