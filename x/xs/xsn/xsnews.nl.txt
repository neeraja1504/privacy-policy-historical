Privacy Policy - XS News
We are XS News B.V., acting under the name XS News. You can find our contact information at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. XS News is a Usenet Access Provider. We provide our users access to the Usenet on the basis of a subscription (the Services ). On our website you can find more information about us and our Services: www.xsnews.nl (the Website ). This Privacy Policy applies to the use of our Website and our Services.
In this Privacy Policy we explain which personal data we collect through our Website and Services. We also explain for which purposes we use personal data, how we secure them and how long we store them.
We care about your privacy. We comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”), which replaced the various privacy laws in European Member States as per 25 May 2018. This legislation will be referred to hereinafter as the “ Relevant Legislation ”.
In this Privacy Policy the notion of “ personal data ” is understood as all the information by which you can be, directly or indirectly, identified. This definition is in accordance with the Relevant Legislation. Be aware that it is a broad definition: even dynamic IP addresses are considered to be personal data under certain circumstances.
We can collect various sorts of personal data of you when you use our Website and/or Services:
(Personal) Data | Purpose(s)
---|---
First and last name | We use these data to contact you in our correspondence and to enter you in our accounting records in the right manner.
E-mail address | We use your e-mail address to create an account for you and to be able to contact you. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters and direct marketing, unless you object to this. We do not send newsletters and direct marketing to users having a free trial subscription, unless we have permission to do so.

There are several legal grounds within the Relevant Legislation on the basis of which we are allowed or required to process your personal data:

Legal obligation: We are required to store several data in our records for Tax Authorities, such as invoice data and your country of residence.
Legitimate interest: For other data we have a legitimate interest for processing, such as for logging user activities in order to identify unlawful use of the account.
Permission: For sending newsletters and direct marketing through email to users not having a paid subscription we request permission. This permission can also easyily be withdrawn through the unsubscribe link in each newsletter.
We keep the personal data as long as we need them for the purposes stated above:
Personal data in our accounting records for Tax Authorities we store for 7 years;
All the personal data we use within the context of your account we store as long as you have an account with us and afterwards for a period up to 2 years;
Any other data we remove as soon as they are no longer needed for the purposes we collect them for.
We use “ Processors ” to assist us in our Services. Within this context these Processors receive personal data from us which they process by our order. We use Processors, for instance, to store the login data and to process the payments of our users.
The Processors we use for the processing of the personal data are:
