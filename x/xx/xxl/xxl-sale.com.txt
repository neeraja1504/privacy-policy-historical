Privacy
Generally, it is possible to use our website without providing personal data. If personal data (e.g. name, address or email-addresses) are collected on our site, this always occurs - provided that it is possible - on a voluntary basis.
If you register with us as a user, all activity is publicly labelled with your username. Published comments (“quotes”), any specified place of residence and lists of observed offers (“collections”) are thus perceptible to other users and publicly visible. This data can also be collected by search engines (e.g. Google) and is then potentially perceptible to all internet users. The linking of the user with other users and/or their collections (“following”, “follower”) is also publicly visible. In addition, the user is provided with the opportunity to publish their photograph and this is also visibly displayed, together with their username, to other users.
The targeted distribution of your data to third parties does not take place.
We would like to point out that the transfer of data via the internet (e.g. communication by email) may present security issues. It is not possible to completely protect data from being accessed by third parties.
We hereby expressly object to the use by third parties of the contact data published within our obligatory legal notice in order to transmit advertisements which are not expressly requested. The operators of the site expressly reserve the right to take legal steps in the event that advertising information is sent without request, such as by spam email.
Privacy statement for the use of Facebook plugins (like button)
Plugins from the social network, Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA are integrated in our website. The Facebook plugins recognise you by the Facebook logo or the “like button" on our site. You will find an overview of Facebook plugins here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
When you visit our site, a direct link is made between your browser and the Facebook server via the plugin. Facebook thereby receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click on the Facebook “like button” whilst you are logged into your Facebook account, you can link the content of our site on your Facebook profile. Facebook can thereby associate the visit to our site with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the site’s provider, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or of how it is used by Facebook. You will find further information on this subject in Facebook’s privacy statement at  http://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php
