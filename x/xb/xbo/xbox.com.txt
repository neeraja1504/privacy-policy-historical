Xbox.com :: privacystatement
Last updated: August 2003
The Xbox.com Web site is operated by the Microsoft Corporation. The Xbox.com Web site provides information about the Xbox gaming system and also serves as an extension of the Xbox Live subscription service for users of the Xbox console.  But you do not have to be an Xbox Live subscriber to access and use most parts of the Xbox.com Web site.
This Privacy Statement applies to the collection of information through the Xbox.com Web site. It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services, or any other game-related sites operated by Microsoft or other publishers. By using the Xbox.com Web site you consent to the data practices described in this Statement.
Collection of your Personal Information
Some features of the Xbox.com Web site require you to create an Xbox.com account. When you create your Xbox.com account, you will be asked for information including your email address. If you choose to enter sweepstakes on the site, we may ask for your address and phone number in order to notify you if you are a winner. If you choose to make a purchase on the site, we will ask for any necessary billing and shipping information.  Information collected by Xbox.com may be combined with information obtained from other Microsoft services and other companies.
Xbox.com uses .NET Passport to provide registration and sign-in services. If you create a .NET Passport at Xbox.com, you are simultaneously registering with Xbox.com and opening a .NET Passport account. To learn more about the Passport service, the information stored in the Passport profile, and how Passport uses and helps protect your personal information, please read the .NET Passport Privacy Statement.
If you are a subscriber of the Xbox Live service, your gamertag, nicknames and statistics such as high scores will be visible to other Xbox Live subscribers on the Xbox.com Web site; and your online presence will be visible to those subscribers who are on your Xbox Live friends list. You will also have the opportunity to link your Xbox Live gamertag to your Passport in the Xbox Live section of the Web site so that your experience can be personalized and so that you will have access to additional features. If you link your gamertag and Passport, this linking may also be shared with other Microsoft and 3rd party game sites in order for those sites to provide you with a personalized experience when you sign in. For details about what information is collected by the Xbox Live service and how that information is used, please see the Xbox Live Privacy Statement at http://www.xbox.com/LIVE/Legal/legal-ps.htm.
You have the option of registering your Microsoft Xbox product(s) via Xbox.com.  Product registration requires you to provide additional information, such as your name and postal address. The registration information received on the Xbox.com Web site is stored along with all Xbox product registrations received via registration card or over the telephone.
Xbox.com keeps track of the pages you visit and other activities on this Web site, in order to determine which areas of the site are the most popular. This data is also used to deliver customized content and advertising to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Xbox.com also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software when you visit the site. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Xbox.com for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Xbox.com site.
Use of your Personal Information
Xbox.com collects and uses your personal information to operate the Xbox.com site and deliver the services you have requested.  For example, we use your email address to send you service-related mailings and any newsletters, marketing information, or promotional offers that you have requested. As described below, you can choose whether or not you want to receive the newsletters, marketing information and promotional offers, but certain service-related mailings are considered an essential part of the service.
We use geographical location to determine what localized information Xbox.com should provide customers. When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, we request your email address and other contact information in order to be able to contact you in the event you are a winner.
Except as otherwise stated below, personal information you provide on this site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters, answering customer questions, fulfilling requests, providing Xbox repair services, and performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver such services, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
The Xbox.com site may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and the Xbox.com site; or (c) act under urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft products, its web sites, or the public.
Personal information collected by Xbox.com may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Xbox.com site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

Xbox.com may send out periodic emails informing you of technical service issues, information about account issues, or news about changes or updates to the site.
