Privacy Policy
How Do We Protect Your Information? ****
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order, enter, submit, or access your personal information. We use a secure server for all supplied sensitive/credit information which is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encrypted into our Payment Gateway Providers’ Database. The database is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights, who are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information will not be stored in our server.
Do We Use Cookies?
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the sites or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.
