We will limit the collection and use of personally identifiable information ("Individual Information"), to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the quality Services, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information unless (i) we believe that such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (including without limitation search warrants, court orders, or providing assistance to law-enforcement authorities investigating the alleged commission of a crime), (2) with respect to payment processing and billing (e.g., to a credit-card bank may help us prove the legitimacy of a credit-card charge or bill), (3) if the disclosure of Individual Information is necessary to provide services that third parties provide to you on Beronata Services's behalf, or (4) as otherwise set forth herein (i.e., in Section 5 hereunder).

We safeguard Billing Information from unauthorized access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted access to Individual Information. Beronata Services employees who violate Beronata Services's privacy policies are subject to disciplinary actions, including possible termination. We may use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage, processing, and other limited functions on Beronata Services's behalf.

Beronata Services, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances (including without limitation a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis.

2.4. Compelling Obligation.
Although Beronata Services will take reasonable measures not to disclose Billing Information, we may be compelled to do so in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce Beronata Services's terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (e) to protect the interests of Beronata Services or others.
