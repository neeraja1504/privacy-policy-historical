About Xomba.com
Xomba.com is an online service that allows members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. Xomba members may view each other’s profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, as well as share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. Xomba members may change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.
Xomba.com cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please contact us.
Information Collection and Use by Xomba.com Xomba.com collects user-submitted information such as name, email address and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Xomba.com service. Xomba.com also collects other profile data including, but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.
Xomba.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information -- including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data and browser type -- from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website’s services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.
User Profile information, including members' pictures and first names, are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Xomba.com social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Xomba, to add users to members' friends' networks and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on Xomba.com with each other through the Xomba.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, Xomba.com allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.
We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" setting to "Do not send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings"
From time to time, Xomba.com or a partner may sponsor promotions, sweepstakes or contests on Xomba.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address, or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members Xomba members may invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Xomba.com stores the email addresses, which are provided by members. Those who respond to the invitations will be added to the friends list of the person who sent the invitations. Xomba.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations or invitation reminders (up to three [3] per email address). Recipients of invitations from Xomba.com may contact Xomba.com to request the removal of their information from our database.
