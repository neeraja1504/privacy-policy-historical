Xola employs, or our third party advertising partners employ, various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, analytics software or other similar technologies, that help us better manage, operate, administer maintain, develop, analyze and support our Digital Properties and the content provided on such Digital Properties.
Cookies: When you visit our Digital Properties we send one or more "cookies" to your computer or other devices. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to help personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate additional site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analyzing usage for site optimization, providing custom content, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on our Website will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Collected Information you submit while on our Website.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our Website or to save things like your user ID and password. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
Functional cookies, persistent and session type, store information to enable core site functionality, such as Live Chat and Client ID remembrance. Analytics cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site and our marketing campaigns.
Advertising cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. Data may be collected by these companies that enable them to serve up advertisements on other sites that are relevant to your interests.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but some features on the site will not function properly.
Web Beacons: Xola may use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Digital Properties. Web Beacons are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. Web Beacons may be used within the Digital Properties to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to your Collected Information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Third Party Tracking Technologies: The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company or third party service provider is not covered by our privacy statement.
Analytics Software: We and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files on our Digital Properties to gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes. This information includes internet protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to track and aggregate non-personal information to analyze trends, administer, operate and improve the Digital Properties, track users' movements around our Digital Properties and to gather demographic information about our user base in the aggregate. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and for marketing, analytics, or functionality and operation of the Digital Properties.
Mobile Analytics: We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

In such case, we will ask you for your colleagues’/friend’s email address or telephone number. We will then automatically send your friend a one-time email or SMS message inviting them to download or use our Mobile Application. Xola stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email or SMS and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at support@xola.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
