XL Airways How We Use Your Data
PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY
XL.com will do everything possible to protect our customers' privacy and to ensure the security of all customer information. We will never give or sell your personal details to a third party except where we are obliged to by law (see the section on Confidentiality, below). This section of the site explains how we use your information.
PASSENGER INFORMATION
When you book a flight through XL.com, there are certain pieces of information which we will always need. These are: name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card details. And of course for each booking you make, we will need to know the names of the people travelling with you.
You shall be liable for any passenger information you enter when booking a flight.
Once we have this information, we will be able to send you (by post or email) confirmation of your booking.
In the unlikely event of a problem occurring with your reservation, we will try to contact you by telephone so that we can inform you of the situation and discuss your alternative options.
CONSENT
When you use the XL.com website, we will assume that you are consenting to the use of the information according to the conditions laid out above.
COMPETITIONS AND PROMOTIONS
We regularly run competitions and promotions and if you want to take part you will need to provide us with your name, address and email address. As long as we have this information, we can ensure that the competition or promotion is conducted fairly and according to the rules.
CAMPAIGN COMMENTS
We often ask our customers for their comments on the service we provide and you may be emailed for your opinion on a particular subject. If you let us know that you do not wish your comments to be published on the XL.com website, we will of course comply with your wishes. If you let us know that you do not want us to e mail you with a request for your opinion then again we will of course comply with your wishes.
XL.com NEWSLETTER
Subscribers to our email newsletter are always the first to know about special offers and other news items of interest. We will assume that you want to hear about these special offers by email unless you tell us otherwise. If you don't want to receive these email offers, you can simply click the 'unsubscribe' button which can be found at the foot of each newsletter.
SITE TRACKING
We are constantly developing the site to make navigation as easy as possible for all our visitors, and one part of this requires us to monitor the way the site is used. This may involve the use of cookies, which are small pieces of software placed onto your computer's hard disk by the website. They are used to enhance your use of the website e.g. by allowing you to log in automatically or by remembering your preferences each time you visit. If you would prefer not to receive these cookies then you can disable their use by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.
SECURITY
When you are booking a flight, we offer the use of the latest secure server software (Thawte's SuperCert) which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. This security always applies when placing orders with your credit card.
As required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.
CONFIDENTIALITY
The personal information you disclose to us is confidential and will not be traded, sold or rented to any third party outside of the XL Leisure Group. We will only ever disclose personal information without your consent is if a) we are legally required to do so or b) if there is an emergency.
We do provide statistics about our customers and sales to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics never contain any information which can identify you personally.
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
From time to time we may decide to change our privacy policy, but any changes will be posted on this page to keep you up to date with how we collect, use and disclose information.
