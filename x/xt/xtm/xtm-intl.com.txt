A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser.
The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the

We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session
cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; and. We will use the persistent cookies
to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.

The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the
website. Google will store this information.              Google's privacy policy is available at:
