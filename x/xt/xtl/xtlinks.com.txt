PII that may be collected includes information such as your first name, last name, date of birth, telephone number, mailing and home address, zip code, email address, social security number; bank account information, financial information, employment information, and driver’s license number (collectively referred to herein as "PII").
We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") about you when you visit many of the pages of this Website. NPII is data used in the aggregate to analyze trends, administer the Website, track movement and understand consumer behavior generally. The information collected by virtue of your access to and use of this Website may be collected irrespective of whether you submit information to register for our services. This NPII includes, without limitation, the type of browser that you use, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, the type of operating system that you use, referral/exit pages, date/time stamp and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. An IP address is a unique identifier that a device uses to identify and communicate with on the Internet.
We may share NPII with third parties, in our discretion.
2. How Your Personally Identifiable Information is Used and Shared
We ask you for PII when you interact with the Website and/or when you dial the number(s) provided on our website. We value your privacy and have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with relevant legislation, including, without limitation, the California Online Privacy Protection Act.
Broadly speaking, the information collected by and through your access to and use of this Website will be used to assist you with your inquiry, to fulfill your request and for solicitation purposes with respect to third party products, services, offers or promotions. Such collected information may also be used for other purposes for which you have given your consent, to prevent fraud, or as may otherwise be permitted by applicable law. To those ends, you expressly authorize Company to share such collected information as set forth herein.
We use the PII collected from you to facilitate your request for access to the third party providers of the products and/or services you are interested in. This may include passing your PII on to a third party lender with whom we have a contract to provide such products and/or services.
Company may share your PII with third parties who help us in the delivery the services you have requested and to companies/individuals we employ to perform technical functions on our behalf. These companies and individuals may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose. We may also use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot technical problems, enforce our agreements with you and to enable Company and/or third parties to personalize your Internet experience. We may also share the information we collect from you with consumer reporting and related agencies.
We may disclose any/all information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
We may also disclose and transfer any/all information to a third party who acquires any or all of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our liquidator, administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the court. You may be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the Website. In each of these situations, the recipients of your data may potentially be located in any country in the world.
IVR
We also provide you with the option of calling the numbers provided on our website(s) to get connected with participating third party lenders and/or providers. When you dial the phone number(s) provided, you are connected with an interactive voice system and are asked a series of questions that include your PII. These questions allow us to determine what services and/or products you might be interested in and connect you with a participating third party lender or provider. You can terminate the call at any time. Please be advised that if a call is terminated before we are able to gather all the needed information, you will not be matched/connected with a third party lender or provider. Calls may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. Please check with your phone carrier as standard phone rates and fees may apply.
First and Third Party Marketing
Company expressly reserves the right to sell or transfer your PII to independent third parties, including, without limitation, third party lenders, advertisers in Company’s network, independent companies or organizations with whom we have a marketing relationship, information re-sellers and third party marketers, some of who may sell information to advertisers and retailers that may present you offers for goods or services (collectively, “Third Party Marketers”). Your information may also be sold by and amongst Third Party Marketers. The foregoing may involve the use of technology information. Separate lists may be maintained for different purposes. If you wish to end your inclusion in a particular list, you need only to follow the instructions at the end of each communication to unsubscribe from the particular list.
Company and/or Third Party Marketers may target advertising to you using direct mail, email, telemarketing calls (including SMS text messages), and/or targeted online banner advertising,. Company and/or Third-Party Marketers may match your PII to make and improve profiles of you, to track your online browsing habits over time and across different websites on the Internet, to show you targeted advertising for products and/or services, and/or to determine which areas of the Internet are most frequently visited.
Although our contractual arrangement may limit how such third parties can use your PII, we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties. Be aware that the Third Party Marketers may retain or use your PII whether or not you use their products and/or services and you should contact these third parties directly concerning their privacy and information sharing practices which may differ from ours. If you have any questions or wish to remove your information from a third party’s database, you will need to contact that third party, directly.
By visiting and/or supplying your PII at this Website, you also agree to allow us to provide aggregated anonymous data about you to third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Website and in order to offer you products and services. This includes demographic information and behavioral information.

Credit Implications
Our participating third party lenders may verify, without limitation, your social security number and driver's license number, or any other qualifying identification and review your information against national databases to determine credit worthiness, standing and/or capacity.

They allow us and/or Third Party Marketers to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also assist with the provision of a customized browsing experience and with the detection of certain kinds of fraud.

6. Security of Your Personally Identifiable Information
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information we gather online, Company stores your PII in a database on secure systems. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security procedures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. All of our visitors’ PII is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information, to the extent reasonably possible.

But notwithstanding such measures, Company cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent Company computers from being illegally accessed, and the data on them stolen or altered, and Company assumes no responsibility for such actions. You may request that your information be modified or deleted as detailed below.
