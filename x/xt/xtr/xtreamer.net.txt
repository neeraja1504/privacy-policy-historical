**Our Promise to You Regarding Your Privacy
** Last Updated: April 11, 2009
At Xtreamer.net, we do more than protect your data. We care about your privacy.
As a global leader in HDD multimedia solutions, Xtreamer.net, knows the value of information and understands your concerns about privacy. As a result, we believe that you have the right to know how we collect and use your personal information. Xtreamer.net values your trust and respects your privacy — and is committed to protecting them.
How does Xtreamer.net gather and use customer information?
When you place an order, register a product, obtain technical support, download software, enter a contest or respond to our promotional campaigns we will gather certain personal information from you to respond to your request. For example, we will collect personal information such as your credit card number, contact information, billing and shipping address and use it to complete your order. In addition, we may use aggregate information to improve our website, but that information is never personally identifiable.

Will Xtreamer.net share my information with other companies or people?
Xtreamer.net will not sell, rent, trade, or lease your personal information for marketing purposes. We will only share information with third-party agents who provide services for our business operation. These agents must comply with our privacy policies and cannot use your personal data for any other purpose. Apart from this, we disclose personal information only in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; respond to any claims; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Xtreamer.net, our customers, or the public. Note to European Customers:
The information you provide us will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for the purpose of processing by Xtreamer.net, its affiliates and agents. By submitting your information, you agree to that international transfer.
