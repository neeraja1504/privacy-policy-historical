We require that they agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted by law. We may make such disclosures, in some cases, without providing Users notice.
Xtranormal reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Xtranormal from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site; and to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our Users or other persons.

When your personal information is no longer required for a specific purpose or legal requirement, it will be erased from our records.
Where is my personal information located?
Your personal information may be stored and processed in servers, including those of our authorized third parties, located in Canada. These servers shall always be subject to the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy to protect against unauthorized collection, use or disclosure, and you shall be able to access the personal information stored in such servers in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Your choices:
You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable information with Xtranormal, in which case, Xtranormal may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update, correct, or delete your User account information and email preferences at any time by going to the Edit Profile section of the Site; provided however, that upon deletion of your account or profile, please note that some of your personal information, including billing and contact information, may remain in Xtranormal's systems for some limited period of time.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
Please e-mail customer support with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy.
Third-Party advisers, Links to other Sites:
Xtranormal allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly through your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Site and they automatically receive your IP address when this happens. Such third party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
Xtranormal does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Xtranormal to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third party ad servers or ad networks. Xtranormal privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of such other advertisers or web sites.
Xtranormal's commitment to data security:
Xtranormal uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of User information you transmit to Xtranormal and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, Xtranormal makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If Xtranormal learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Xtranormal may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should e-mail customer support.
Xtranormal's commitment to children's privacy:
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Xtranormal does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If Xtranormal learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on the Site without verifiable parental consent, then Xtranormal will take the appropriate steps to delete the information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an Xtranormal User Account, then you may e-mail customer support and request that Xtranormal delete that child's personal information from its systems.

In the event of Merger, sale or bankruptcy:
If Xtranormal is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from the Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used.
