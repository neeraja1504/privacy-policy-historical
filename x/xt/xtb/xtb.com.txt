We limit access of your data to only those employees or partners that need to know the information
in order to assist in carrying out your request for products or services. We have procedures in place
regarding how to safeguard and use non public personal information.
Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on sensitive information,
this means that personal information may be disclosed to: service providers and specialist advisers to
us who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, research or other services;
referring parties and introducing partners with whom we have a mutual relationship; courts, tribunals
and regulatory authorities as agreed or authorised by the law, and when we believe that disclosure is
necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding; or reference agencies;
anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the contract.

protection of cryptographic keys to ensure encrypted data is kept private and secure.
