However none of this information will be personally identifiable – it shall be used for research purposes only, and in aggregate form. You will know what the survey is about before you take it, and will have the option of canceling it at anytime before or during the survey. We do not work or associate with research companies that are in the business of trading personal information.
Affiliate Offers
You can sign up for a promotional offer by an advertiser to earn Peanuts. This will require you to click on a link, and leave the XUQA site.

Logging
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system and date/time stamp.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected server data to personally identifiable information.
Cookies & GIFS
A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. iVentster, Inc. uses cookies to keep you logged in to the site, and to enable the proper functioning of other services used by you on the site. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate within a few hours of use. We also use persistent cookies to identify users uniquely to reduce cheating and fraud. These cookies will stay on your computer even after you logout of XUQA. We do not use cookies to collect any non-XUQA-related information from any user. Most browsers are set to automatically accept cookies, however you can set your browser to prompt you or refuse cookies. This may cause problems in running and accessing some services on the website.
We do not use “clear gifs” or other images to record, process, transfer, log or transmit any user information, with one exception: for security purposes, your email address is displayed as an image on your profile so that it cannot be “read” by a spam bot or automated program. Other than this security feature, we do not use images to process any user account or profile information.
Third-Party Advertisers
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by iVentster, Inc. and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
Survey Providers
Surveys may be provided to Users as a means to earn peanuts and other rewards on XuQa through our Survey partners, agents or affiliates. Surveys are completely optional, and you can elect to take a survey if you would like to obtain the supplemental membership benefits associated with it.
Each survey is different, and will ask you for detailed information on your household, demographic, education, work, spending habits and other consumer areas. This information is not stored by XuQa.com, and is submitted directly to the partners, agents or affiliates we work with to administer these surveys. They use this information to determine which surveys are relevant to you and other users. Information that you enter into the survey itself will be submitted to the company(ies) who have commissioned the survey, and they will use this data in aggregate form for internal research purposes. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN TAKING SURVEYS, AND ONLY SUBMIT INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE DISCLOSING TO THIRD-PARTIES OTHER THAN XUQA. PLEASE DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY CONTACT INFORMATION IN ANY SURVEY.
When electing to take a survey, you will at some point be required to leave the Xuqa site to take the survey. While on another site, you are subject to that site’s privacy procedures as outlined in their privacy policy. Though we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other organizations and companies, we have worked to encourage Xuqa-affiliated survey providers to follow the privacy practices outlined in this policy. If you suspect there is a case of abuse, please contact us at feedback@xuqa.com
YOU WILL NEVER BE REQUIRED TO GIVE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, NAME, CONTACT INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO A SURVEY PROVIDER AFFILIATED WITH XUQA. If you have been asked for such information in a survey, please email us immediately at feedback@xuqa.com
Data Center
Our servers are fully owned by us, but as is the case with almost all websites, our servers are located in an external server facility that is not owned, nor operated by us. Our servers and your information is protected by being in a locked data warehouse with highly restricted access, back-up power supplies, climate control and data recovery through scheduled back-ups.
The technicians and engineers operating the data center where our servers are located sometimes need to check connections for security and maintenance purposes. In such routine cases, they may look at your IP address and Internet Service Provider information to verify you as a real user (instead of a hacking program or a bot). They cannot access your Xuqa account and profile information that you have entered into the Website. This information about you is the same that is publicly available through your IP address to anyone you connect to via the internet, or any website that you visit on the Internet.
Links to other sites
XuQa.com may contain links to other web sites (such as the “Our Blog” link at the bottom of XUQA pages). These other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.
Your registration information is used for the following purposes:
1. To create your account.

The security of your personal information is important to us. All XuQa.com accounts are password-protected. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
