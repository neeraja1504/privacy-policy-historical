How does Xdrive use my information?
Xdrive uses the personal information we collect or receive about you to operate and improve the service, as well as to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries.
Xdrive will use your e-mail address to send you e-mails that are generated when you perform certain functions within the service. The types of e-mails that are sent include, but are not limited to, welcome e-mails, share e-mails, and cancellation e-mails.
Xdrive does research on customer demographics and behavior based on the information you provide and how you use the service. We gather information about how you use the service using log files, tracking pixels, and database history tables. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated and de-identified basis.
With whom does Xdrive share my information?
Xdrive will not disclose any of your Xdrive personal information except when we have your permission; in response to legal process or under the circumstances described below. Xdrive does not sell or give access to our customer e-mail list or other customer profile information to third parties. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.
What is Xdrive's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personal information?
You can edit your Xdrive account information at any time by accessing your account using our web interface. Your profile information can be modified by accessing the "My Profile" page once you are logged in. Information associated with your screen name, if applicable, must be modified within the Screen Name Service (SNS).
What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
When you register for an Xdrive account, the signup page may ask you for sensitive information (such as your credit card number). We use industry-standard SSL encryption to help protect the registration information you provide.
Your Xdrive account information and Xdrive customer profile are password-protected to help ensure that you, and only you, have access to this personal information. You may edit your Xdrive account information by logging into our web interface using your Xdrive username and password.
We require that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Xdrive will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Also remember to sign out of your Xdrive account and close your browser window when you finish your work to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information or files if you share a computer with someone or use a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
As a global company, Xdrive has international sites and users all over the world. When you give Xdrive personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States or other countries. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered it.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Xdrive cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or while using the service, and you do so at your own risk. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to help protect personal information stored in our systems.
How Xdrive uses contact information that you might provide when "Sending a File" or "Sharing a Folder"?
When you use Xdrive to "Send a File" or "Share a Folder" with someone, you normally enter the intended recipient's e-mail address into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share. We do not sell or make those e-mail addresses available to any 3rd parties.
When you use Xdrive's "Send a File" feature, you can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file. If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by Xdrive are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient of the shared file.
Using Xdrive's "Share a Folder" feature requires that the person with whom you are sharing have an Xdrive account to access the folder. If the person with whom you are sharing does not already have an Xdrive account, a free sharing account will be created for that person when you share the folder. Xdrive will automatically send an e-mail inviting the person to activate their free account so they can access the folder you have shared. To activate, the sharing account holder will need to register for the service and will need to provide standard information to do so.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. Xdrive does not control and is not responsible for how others use that information.
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Xdrive is not responsible for the privacy or other practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible online.
