Privacy
We keep your personal information as safe as possible. All our member data is managed securely and is compliant with the standards set forth by the University of Pennsylvania and the payment card industry. We monitor the most recent advances in security and adapt as required.
When you provide us payment information to process a donation, this information is encrypted, using reasonable, industry-standard security measures, and processed by vetted third-party vendors to process your donation.
When we ask for personally identifiable information (like your name, address, email address, phone number or credit card information), we only use the information you give us within the WXPN family of services. For example, we may email you to invite you to join a new newsletter list, invite you to WXPN events, or ask you to renew your membership when it expires. Occasionally, we may share your information with third party vendors, but only to help us do these sorts of things, and not for their own use.
We may also aggregate your personally identifiable information, such as your address, with others to produce non-personally identifiable information that we may use to analyze and improve what we do.
It is WXPN’s policy not to sell or exchange email addresses or phone numbers with any organization. If any situation comes up in which we would like to share this information with someone else (e.g. if we collect your email while ticketing an event, and want to share with our co-presenter), we will ask for your permission.
Our digital platforms contain links to services maintained by third parties independent of WXPN. These services and tools are governed by the terms and policies of those third parties. Please review these services’ own privacy policies for more information.
Lastly, if we are required by law to share your information (including personal and payment information), we will share to the extent necessary to comply with the request. If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy of your information, please email memberservices@XPN.org. Any content that you submit to us, must follow the University of Pennsylvania's policy on Copyright Infringement located here.
