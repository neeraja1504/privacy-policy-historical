If you connect to the Services using your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or other third-party service credentials (each, a “Supported Platform”), you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username, encrypted access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through your Supported Platform account, including but not limited to your name, pictures, and friends/followers lists. The information we get from Supported Platforms may depend on your settings or their privacy policies.
Xappie does not store any user financial information, even though we may request information about you and your credit card and/or bank account. Xappie does not store certain financial data due to its use of third party agents, such as PayPal, as its financial transaction facilitator.
