What are Cookies and similar technologies?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store via your browser on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device.
There are three main types of cookies:
Session cookies : specific to a particular visit and limited to sending session identifiers (random numbers generated by the server) so you don't have to re-enter information when you navigate to a new page or check out. Session cookies are not permanently stored on your device and are deleted when the browser closes;
Persistent cookies : record information about your preferences and are stored in your browser cache or mobile; and
Third party cookies : placed by someone other than us which may gather data across multiple websites or sessions.
We may also automatically collect and store certain information about your interaction with our Website or app including IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps and related data.

In addition to cookies, we may use some other similar technologies as follows:
Web Beacons : small graphic images included on our website or emails or those of third parties to provide analytics information
Social widgets : buttons or icons provided by third party social media networks which may collect browsing data and will be received by the third party and are controlled by the third party
SDKs : these are mobile application third party software development kits used in our apps. They enable us to collect information about app activity and the device it runs on.
Local shared objects : these are sometimes called flash cookies and can be stored on your browser. They are used to maintain preferences and usage records.

Mobile Opt-out
If you access our services through our Apps, you can enable a "do not track" feature so as to control interest-based advertising on an iOS or Android mobile device by selecting the Limit Add Tracking option in the privacy section of your Settings on iOS or via advertising preferences on Android devices (e.g. in Google Settings). This will not prevent the display of advertisements but will mean that they will no longer be personalised to your interests.
