Log Data. When you use Ci, we automatically record information from your device, its software, and your activity using Ci. This may include your IP address, browser type, access times, referring website addresses or other information included in HTTP headers. We may also collect information about your account activity and files and pages accessed by you. Such information is sometimes referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data.
Cookies/Web Beacons. We use certain types of technologies such as cookies and web beacons to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information. Among other things, we use this information to make Ci easier to use and to provide you with a more personal and convenient experience.
