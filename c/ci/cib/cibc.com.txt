Using third-party cookies and other web technologies, CIBC may market CIBC products, services or community initiatives on another company's site (e.g., remarketing). CIBC’s partners and service providers may also use third-party cookies and web technologies to collect and use information from CIBC sites and other third-party sites to assist us in this marketing.  In some cases, the content of this marketing may be based on information we know about you, such as your browsing behavior on CIBC sites and third-party sites where you are shown CIBC ads, your CIBC products and services, and the information you have provided to us. If you access one of these marketing ads, we may also track the response rate, the specific CIBC ad that you selected and the site activity associated with each marketing ad. If you enter a third-party site which has a CIBC ad, we may use cookies to help us identify the site you accessed, but we do not track and create a profile of a user’s behaviour on that site. The response rate data is used to help us plan future online marketing campaigns.
CIBC may offer mobile applications or services that use location information. If you choose to use such applications or services, CIBC may, if your geolocation device settings allow us, collect information about your location to provide you with the applications or services you request.
We may also use location information to personalize your user experience including through site or mobile app content, marketing, or offers for products and services. For example, we may use general geographical location derived from your IP address (e.g., city) to customize CIBC site pages for you.
Some services may involve access to information on your device. For example, accessing your contact list can make it easier to use Interac  e-Transfer® banking services, or accessing your photos and camera can make it easier to complete a remote cheque deposit on your mobile device. Some services may allow your device and your wearable to communicate with a CIBC app, such as for Apple Watch®.
