Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Cookies
Some parts of the site are password-protected. We will use a cookie (cookies reside on your computer and are under the control of your browser) to enable you to return to password-protected areas of the website without having to re-enter your password or to otherwise optimize your experience on the site by, for example, tracking the type of webmail you are using to maximize the site’s compatibility with your system. We also may use cookies to track data without identifying specific users as described below.
Data tracking
In order to better serve our members, in addition to collecting the information listed above, we also use cookies and other tools such as Google Analytics and similar services to analyse web activity. These services provide us with statistical data that does not identify any individual. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to our members. We also may collect IP addresses or other data about visits to our website to better understand where our traffic is coming from, how our services are being accessed, and to provide customised services to members.
URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an id—we do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs properly. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser's address bar when you access the page.
