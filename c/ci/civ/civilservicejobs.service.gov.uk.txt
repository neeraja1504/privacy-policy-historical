Retention
Your personal data will be kept by us for the following durations:
Application records and associated files (including CVs, letters, emails, comment and feedback) will be deleted 2 years after the vacancy is archived. A vacancy becomes archived when there are no active applications and either:
the vacancy is manually archived by a recruiter; or
the vacancy is automatically archived 1 year after the advertised closing date.
Candidate accounts - you can, at any time, choose to close your account. This will:
remove your ability to login to the account
withdraw any active applications
delete partially-completed applications which havenâ€™t been submitted
disable the automatic sending of job alerts
Closed accounts are deleted and cannot be restored, however previously submitted applications will be retained until deletion for the period described above.
Candidate accounts that are active will remain in the system unless the candidate deletes them (or makes a request for deletion). An account will become inactive if the user has not logged in for two years.
Vacancy manager accounts
ATS account holders are required to periodically reconfirm that they still require access, otherwise the account will become inactive.
Inactive accounts will be deleted three years after the last time the user logged in. Active accounts will remain in the system.
Automated decision making
Your personal data will be subject to automated decision making when online psychometric tests are used.
Some vacancies use online psychometric tests in the early stages of recruitment. Three tests are commonly used: Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Reasoning and the Civil Service Judgement Test.
Decisions are made on who to invite to later stages based on automated scoring and sifting processes. In addition, test scores and other applicant data are regularly captured for statistical and research analysis purposes.
Your score is calculated from the responses you give during the test, and no other information about you is used. We compare your score to those gained by a peer group who previously took the test, to give you a percentile. The vacancy will have a minimum percentile requirement, and if your score is lower than this, you will be rejected and your application will not be considered further.
