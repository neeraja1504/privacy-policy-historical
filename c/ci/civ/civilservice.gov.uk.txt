Privacy policy - Civil Service
This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.
This privacy statement only covers Civil Service websites. It does not cover all sites that can be linked to from this site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement on that site.
What information do we collect?
If you are a user with general public and anonymous access, the Civil Service website does not capture or store personal information about you but simply logs your IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web server. This is known as a ‘log file’ which we use to compile site usage statistics.
The site does not use cookies to collect user information.
We collect two kinds of information from visitors to this website: feedback; and email subscription details.
Feedback
We welcome your feedback. If you contact us asking for information, we may need to contact other government departments to find that information. If your question is technical, we may need to pass it to our technology suppliers.
We do not pass on any of your personal information when dealing with your enquiry, unless you have given us permission to do so. Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message for audit purposes.
