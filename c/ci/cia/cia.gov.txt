Privacy Statement — Central Intelligence Agency
Overview
The Central Intelligence Agency established the CIA Kids’ Page in compliance with the President’s April 18, 1997, Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies[TXT 5.72KB], Subject: Expanding Access to Internet-based Educational Resources for Children, Teachers, and Parents.
We encourage parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet explorations. The CIA Kids’ Page provides information about the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as games and other fun activities for children and teenagers (and parents and teachers, too). We do not ask for nor do we collect any information regarding children’s visits to our homepage, beyond what is stated in our Privacy Notice. The information collected as described in that statement does not differentiate between adults and children.

As stated, the CIA Kids’ Page is a gateway that can take your children to other sites from our links. We link only to the kids’ sites of other government agencies. While we have selected links that we feel offer reliable information and links, we are not responsible for the content provided on these sites.

It is important that you monitor your children’s communication to ensure they do not provide personal information you feel may be unacceptable. Talk with your children about the importance of online safety and encourage them to ask you or another responsible adult when they have questions regarding this important issue.
