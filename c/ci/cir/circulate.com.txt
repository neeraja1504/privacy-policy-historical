CIRCULATE.COM WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
Effective: November 23, 2015
We at Circulate.com, Inc. are committed to respecting your privacy choices. This Website Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected on the publicly-available sections of the website, www.circulate.com, including any versions optimized for viewing on a wireless or tablet device (the "Website"), however accessed and/or used. We have established this Privacy Policy to tell you about the type of information we may gather during your visit to the Website, how we use and share your information, and how you can manage your information.
This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to:
Information that you may submit to us offline or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.
Circulate.com's hosted advertising platform delivered to customers as software-as-a-service ("SaaS"). To understand how Circulate.com handles its Customer's personally identifiable information with respect to Circulate.com's SaaS, please consult your Publisher Agreement governing that service.
Consumer data collected through Data Supply Side Platform (DSSP). For more information about Circulate.com's consumer privacy practices and models, including its collection of information via our DSSP, mobile identifiers and cookies, visit http://portal.circulate.com/portal/public/privacy.
By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.
I. What Information Is Collected and Stored?
We may collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Website: personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). Personally identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, among other things, information that you may supply to us when you visit the Website, e.g., your company name, your name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. Non-personally identifiable information includes information that does not identify you personally, but it may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Website and the Internet.
A. Personally Identifiable Information
As a general matter, you can browse the Website without submitting your PII to us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your PII, such as when you request customer service or sales help or when you post comments on our blog.
B. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information From or Through Social Media Sites
When you interact with any Circulate.com social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or LinkedIn, we may collect the PII that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID.
C. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
In addition, when you interact with the Website, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of the Website ("non-personally identifiable information" or "non-PII"), such as device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Website. This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. We may also collect usage information about your use of the Website, such as a reading history of the pages you view, or additional "traffic data," such as the time and date of access, software crash reports, session identification number and referring website addresses. We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Website.
D. Collection of Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information From Other Sources
We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources (including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us to verify, update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Website.
E. Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies
Like many websites, we use "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Website. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Website may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, check out our Cookie and Tracking FAQs or visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by unaffiliated third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used.
Your browser or device may include "Do Not Track" functionality. Because a "Do Not Track" compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Circulate.com's information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
II. How Do We Use Your Information?
We use the information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the Website. We may use your personally and non-personally identifiable information to:
Provide you with the content you request
Communicate with you about changes to our policies and send you information about features and enhancements on or to our Website
Send you information about our products and services, third party products and services, or special events by e-mail, text, or another medium

III. Who Do We Share Your Information With?
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your personally identifiable information collected online to any organizations not part of Circulate.com or its subsidiaries or related entities, except as described below. Although we may provide your information to our agents, affiliates, and partners, in no event will we sell or rent your PII as part of a customer list or similar transaction.
A. Third-Party Agents
We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, marketing, analytics, and customer service. These entities may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions. If such access is required, the third parties will be contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that PII. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Website.
B. Business Partners and Other Third Parties
We may share your personally identifiable information with our business partners or co-marketers from time to time. We may also share your PII with third parties that provide products and services that we think you may be interested in. You may withdraw your consent to our sharing of your PII with business partners and third parties at any time by following the opt-out process described below.
C. Assignment
We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Website. We may also sell certain assets associated with the Website. As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to an entity acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.
D. Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations
We may use or disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Website or the public.
E. Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may disclose or share non-personally identifiable information (or other information, other than PII) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we will disclose non-PII to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website. We will also disclose non-PII to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites.
IV. How Can You Opt-Out?
You may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with business partners and third parties by sending an email to privacy@circulate.com with "CUSTOMER OPT-OUT" in the subject line.

V. Other Important Information
How Do We Secure Your Information?
We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, we are unable to guarantee that security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.
How Long Do We Keep Personally Identifiable Information?
The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
Public and Community Areas
Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as the comment sections of our Circulate.com blog ("Public Social Features"), becomes public and anyone may take and use that information.
