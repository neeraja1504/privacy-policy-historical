When you interact with the Website or the Service, CircleCI may gather information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“ Personal Data ”), as described below. If you are an EU data subject, please see the “EU Data Subject” section below for information on your rights in relation to the Personal Data we hold about you.
a) Personal Data used to provide the Service and respond to requests
When users sign up for the Service, users are required to authenticate with their version control system identity (GitHub or Bitbucket). When users log in to the Service using sign-in services such as OAuth (for example, login with a GitHub account), these services will authenticate a user’s identity and provide the user with the option to share certain Personal Data, such as name and email address(es), with us. If you purchase one of our paid plans, we will also collect payment and billing information such as credit card details and billing address. We use this data to provide you with access to the Service and/or the Website, contact you regarding your access and use of the Service and/or the Website or to notify you of important changes to the Service. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us.
On some sections of the Website, you may complete a web form to give your Personal Data to us directly, such as on our “Contact Us” page. We also collect Personal Data (such as your name and contact details, phone number) when you request information, including a product demo, ask to download content (such as white papers), register for a webinar or other event, or subscribe to email lists. We will use your contact information to respond to your request. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary to respond to or implement your request. If you send us a request or question regarding the use of the Service (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may publish it (in anonymous form only) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
CircleCI collects Personal Data that you provide through the Service only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with CircleCI, such as providing you with the Service and/or answering any requests regarding the Service as described above. You can always refuse to supply Personal Data, however doing so may prevent you from accessing the Service or engaging in certain activities on the Website or the Service.
b) Personal Data used to process applications for employment
When you submit a job application through the Website, we will collect your resume and any additional information that you elect to provide to us, including but not limited to employment history and education.

For EU data subjects, this use is necessary to respond to your request to process your application for employment.
c) Personal Data used for marketing
We will use your email to tell you about your Service usage, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with CircleCI and our products, upcoming events or other promotions.

III. Information We Process On Behalf Of Our Customers
In providing the Service to our customers, we process on behalf of customers certain information that may include Personal Data, relating to customers’ employees, contractors or other users (“ Users ”) they transmit or otherwise submit to our Service.

Privacy Shield
CircleCI complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“ Frameworks ”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). CircleCI has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
We rely on our Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data and other information that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to CircleCI in the U.S. and we process this data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice and Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“ Privacy Shield Principles ”), as described below.
Notice And Choice: This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and transferred under the Privacy Shield and the choice that you have with respect to such Personal Data. It also provides information about other Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below. When we process Personal Data collected through the Service on behalf of our customers, the customer will be responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice to its Users, as the customer controls the Personal Data it has submitted to our Service. Except as required or permitted by applicable law, we honor all customers’ requests from their Users to limit use or disclosure of Users’ Personal Data.
Accountability for Onward Transfers: We may be accountable for the Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield that we may transfer to third-party service providers (as described in the “Disclosure of Personal Data” section above) if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and we are responsible if they do so and for the harm caused.
Security: We maintain security measures to protect Personal Data as described in the “Security” section of this Privacy Policy.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation: We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, and that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as long as we retain it. We will keep your Personal Data only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for the duration required by law or our customer agreement, whichever is the longer.
Access: You have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. When we process Personal Data on behalf of our customers, the customer will be responsible to respond to requests for exercising your rights. We honor all customers’ requests from their Users to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data.
Recourse, Enforcement, Liability: In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, CircleCI commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact CircleCI as follows:

Phone: +1-800-585-7075
Postal Mail:
Circle Internet Services, Inc.
Attention: Privacy

San Francisco, CA, 94105
CircleCI has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

Cookies
We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to optimize the functionality of the Website, help us understand how the Website is used and provide you with interest-based advertising based upon a user’s browsing activities and interests. For more information about the cookies and similar technologies used on our Website, please refer to our Cookie Policy and Security page.
Links to Other Websites
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and the Service and not to any third-party sites or hosted services you may find or access through our Website. If you submit Personal Data to any of those sites or services, your information will be governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted service you use.
Social Media Widgets
The Website and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Website or the Service. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting. CircleCI does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. CircleCI takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.
Security
We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Data. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter your login information on the Service, all information to and from the service is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). For more information on our data security policies, please check here.
That said, like any hosted service provider, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personal Data despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and the Service, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under our control.
We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Website or the Service. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.
If you have any questions about security on the Website or the Service, you can contact us.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, CircleCI may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in CircleCI’s sole discretion. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will either notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Website and/or within the Service prior to the change becoming effective, or as otherwise required by the applicable law. We encourage you to periodically review the Website for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Website and the Service after any change in this Privacy Policy takes effect will constitute your acceptance of such change.
