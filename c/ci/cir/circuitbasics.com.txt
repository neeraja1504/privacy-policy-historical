These server logs typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. This data is stored for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve Google’s services and to maintain the security of Google’s systems. Google anonymizes this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).
The cookies may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites.
