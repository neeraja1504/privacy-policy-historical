The Companies & Intellectual Property Registration Office ("CIPRO") is committed to protecting the privacy of our customer's personal information. This Policy explains how we gather and use the information that we collect from our Web site, located at CIPRO.gov.za. This policy may change over time. Amendments to this statement will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof.
Information Collected
As you navigate within our Web site, we will be collecting and tracking personal information, either by asking you to tell us something about yourself (such as your name, address or e-mail address) or by using data-tracking software which records your IP address and tells us what parts of the Web Site you have browsed.
Use of Information
This information is used to enhance your site experience, or to apply special benefits. Your personal information will not be sold to third parties for e-mail marketing or telemarketing campaigns.
The information may be used by CIPRO or designated site partners to send you information that we think will be useful to you.
Due to the technology behind the CIPRO site, your personal information may also be shared with designated site partners in order to reduce the number of registrations you need to make on the CIPRO site. This is an effort to make use of the CIPRO.gov.za site more convenient for you.
You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from CIPRO and other entities by following the instructions set forth in the opt-out section below.
Personal information about you, whether obtained through collection or tracking, may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. We will also be collecting and tracking information about activities in our Web site on an aggregate (i.e., group basis). We will not know or keep track of precisely who you are as you use the site. The data is used to track what areas of the site are most frequently used to help us improve the site in the future. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you again.
Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content we think you might be interested in. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate non-personal basis.
We may share your information (as described above) with our business partners to provide you with products or services that you have requested or to provide you with promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you. Our business partners include all of our affiliated companies as well as other selected businesses with which we have a relationship and which have agreed to adhere to our strict standards for providing quality products and services, responding to your needs, and protecting customer information. We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including direct and targeted marketing), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
In certain circumstances, we may share your customer information with trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. In the event of a sale of all or part of one of our businesses, we may share customer information related to that business as part of the transaction.
