It is our goal to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy.
THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS
Personally identifiable information is collected by the Website with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, register for our forum or business profile, you maybe be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. By submitting such web form contained on this Website, you agree to the processing and storage of your information by the Service Provider.
If you contact us by email through the Website, we reserve the right to also keep a record of the email itself and any personally identifiable information provided in that email and any others that result, in order to respond to them and for any other purpose described in this Policy.
Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, date and time of the visit, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university, and may identify your physical location.
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We generally do not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties. However, we reserve the right to disclose this information if we reasonably believe it is needed for any of the following reasons:
1. Pursuant to a subpoena or other governmental request
2. For any other reason required by law
3. In order to protect our employees, independent contractors, affiliates, the users of this Website or the public at large and their property, rights and safety

Your personally identifiable information may also be disclosed, without limitation, if the Service Provider is acquired or in the event of any sale or transfer of assets of the Service Provider.
We use the personally identifiable information that we receive to contact you about your requests to us. We may also, from time to time, send you information that we feel that you might be interested in.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.

SURVEYS AND CONTESTS

HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU
We may use personally identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to our forum, we may use your e-mail address to send you periodic e-mails. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail.
We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. We reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times contain sufficient information for us to be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.
We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.
As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets.

AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS
We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.
