Cookies and Web Beacons
We may use cookies or web beacons (“pixel tags,” “clear pixels”) to control the display of ads, track usage patterns on the Website, deliver editorial content and record registration and personalization information. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with Our affiliates and other companies. Some of Our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have displayed by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before or to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data, such as your browser type, operating system, Web pages visited, time of visit, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their privacy policies, not Ours, and We disclaim all liability in connection therewith.
If you do not want to receive cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them. However, some portions of the Website may not function properly if cookies are rejected by your browser.

By using the Website, you agree to assume any and all risk related to information sent to Us or collected by Us when you use the Website. In the unlikely event that We believe the security of information about you in Our possession or control to have been compromised, We may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, We may notify you by email provided that We have your email address.
