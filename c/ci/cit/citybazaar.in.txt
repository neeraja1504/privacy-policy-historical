How we gather information from users.
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.

Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features ( shopping, ticket booking etc), sign up for a subscription or make a purchase.
Like most Web sites, City Bazaar Media P. Ltd. also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.

As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password.
