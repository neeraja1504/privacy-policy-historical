If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

Personal Information We Collect
We receive and store any information you provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, job title and institutional or organizational affiliation in order to create an online account. We also receive and store information you provide us that is contained in user submissions, including without limitation, figures, datasets and media you submit to the Site. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or take advantage of some or all of the Services featured on the Site. In addition, we may provide Personal Information to our partners, content providers or other third parties anonymously so that you cannot be individually identified.
Non-Personal Information We Collect
We collect certain aggregated and non-personal information when you visit our Site. Aggregated and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us information such as how many users visited our website and which pages were accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Site to our visitors. We collect this information either through a "cookie".
Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.
Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of our Site and its Services. You can find out more about our cookies policy below.
Information We Share
We do not sell or otherwise disclose information about our visitors, except as described here. We may share the information you provide with affiliates of Macmillan Publishers Limited (i.e. companies in our group) and our joint marketing partners. We may also share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorised by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (ii) to law enforcement agencies following an appropriate request; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided through our Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
How We Protect Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide on our websites.

We will provide users with access to a copy of their Personal Information which they have provided through our Site, where such users are reasonably entitled to ask for this, (for which we may charge a small fee not exceeding the statutory maximum) and they will have the ability to review and correct it, as applicable. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your Personal Information.
