City Weekend - Editorial Privacy Policy
City Weekend is committed to protecting privacy online. We believe that greater protection of personal privacy on the web will not only protect users, but also increase user confidence and ultimately their participation in online activities. At City Weekend, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information.
The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.
Our site may contain links to other web sites. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide links from our sites. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when linking to other web sites.
Information Which We Collect
We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone number. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.
We may require you to supply us with personal information (demographic information such as average age, income, education, population data, zip codes) during a "registration" process online. We use this general information to aggregate information according to demographics, such as gender, geographic location, age, income or a combination of these or other demographics.

We do not use personal identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested. We never send e-mail to you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There are instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but this will be done only with your permission and consent
