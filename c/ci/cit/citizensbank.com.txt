We protect customers who have opened an account or obtained a financial product or service from us for personal, family or household purposes. This notice also applies to former customers and to consumers who have provided information to us but have not entered into a customer relationship, for as long as information is retained. This notice does not apply to business or commercial customers.
A. Collection, Use and Retention of Your Information
We limit the collection, use and retention of your information to what we believe is necessary to provide you with exceptional quality service, comply with regulatory requirements, and make available to you other products, services, and opportunities that may be of interest to you. For example, your information may be used to evaluate your eligibility for a loan or other service, to improve our products and services or the way we deliver them to you, or to protect you from fraud.

We also use them for marketing site personalization, and tracking of online applications and programs. Our server recognizes and records the domain name from which visitors to our site accessed the Internet and the names of the pages visited while at our site. It does not, however, collect and store your electronic mail address or other nonpublic personal information, unless you provide it to us.
