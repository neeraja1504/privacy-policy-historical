When you make a reservation, you provide us with reservation data such as your name, (email) address, phone number, reservation details and payment information as applicable. We use this data to process the reservation and your stay, for billing purposes, and to communicate with you about your reservation.

If you book via a booking agent, the agent will provide us with such data.

To simplify future bookings, you can choose to create an account to save the data you provide us during your booking.

In some countries, we are obligated to register specific information when you arrive at a citizenM Hotel. This may include your date of birth, nationality, visa information, place of residence, date of arrival and your profession. We may also be obligated to verify your identity at arrival based on a passport or other ID document. We will only make a copy of your identification document if we are obligated to do so.
Room systems
We store data about your use of the systems in the hotel room to ensure that the systems and appliances in our rooms work correctly, such as data regarding the light, entertainment and air-condition systems. This information is used by our 24/7 support team for technical support purposes. We also use such information at an aggregated level to learn about how customers use our services and how we can improve our services.
Parking
If you park in our parking garage, we may need to process your license plate number in order to give you access to the parking garage.
Security/CCTV
We endeavour to protect our properties, employees, guests and their belongings from illegal activities such as theft and vandalism. Personal data may be processed in this context by or on behalf of citizenM, including the use of CCTV surveillance.
Chatbot
Our websites and social media accounts include a chatbot you can talk to about citizenM related matters. Please note that your conversations with the chatbot are stored for self-learning purposes of our chatbot. In addition to answering your queries, we may also use such conversations to learn more about you to improve your experience as our customer. If you use the chatbot, your IP address is collected for technical purposes.
Direct marketing
We provide our customers with targeted commercial communications for our own products and services. This means that we base such communications on data we have collected in the context of previous orders/bookings, such as your purchase history, your age, online behaviour on our websites or data we have collected in the context of your stay in our hotel(s).
You can easily opt-out for such communications when you make a reservation via our websites or via the unsubscribe button included in such communications.
With your explicit consent, we and our partners use cookies and similar techniques for the purposes of online cross-site targeted advertising. Please read the "Cookies" section below to find out more.
Newsletters
We regularly provide you with newsletters via e-mail if you sign up for such updates. We also send newsletters to existing customers. If you no longer wish to receive such newsletters, you can unsubscribe at any time.

Security, data retention and international transfers
We have implemented appropriate measures to protect your personal data against loss, alteration or any form of unlawful use. Where appropriate, your personal data will be encrypted and securely stored. Access to your personal data by our staff is restricted on a need-to-know basis.
We do not retain personal data longer than is necessary to fulfil the processing purposes as set out in this Privacy Statement (see "When and why do we use your personal data?"). To determine the exact retention period, we take into account applicable minimum data retention obligations, guidance issued by data protection authorities and statute of limitations under applicable law(s).
As we operate internationally, your personal data may be transferred to a citizenM hotel or other recipients (such as franchisees) in a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside of your country of residence or nationality. For technical and organizational reasons and in the context of our digital cloud infrastructure, personal data is also transferred to servers located in the US, or to servers located in countries outside of the European Economic Area. In this regard, we have entered into so-called EU model clauses with receiving parties or make use of Privacy Shield  certified partners to ensure compliance with our data protection obligations, or have ensured that a receiving party has in place so-called "binding corporate rules". Please contact us if you wish to receive more information on the specific safeguards we have implemented to ensure an adequate level of data protection regarding such transfers.
