Personal Data Protection Policy
Personal Data Protection is important to us
Protection of your Personal Data is important to us. This Ascott Personal Data Protection Policy (“ Policy ”) outlines how we manage the Personal Data we hold. The Policy applies to all departments and business units across the Ascott Group. The Ascott Limited (Reg. No.197900881N), and/or its related corporations and affiliates (referred to hereunder as “Ascott”, the “Ascott Group”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collectively or singularly as the context requires, recognise the importance of protecting Personal Data.
We respect the confidentiality of Personal Data and privacy of individuals and are committed to complying with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (Act 26 of 2012) (“ PDPA ”) and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union (“ EU ”) General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”) where applicable. Please read this Policy so that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Data.
We adopt a pragmatic “Data- light , Data- tight ” approach in our business conduct.
“Data- light ” means that we collect Personal Data only for what is required in business or in activities conducted by our organisation and will properly destroy the Personal Data once there is no business or legal purpose. We do not collect Personal Data randomly or indiscriminately without purpose.
“Data- tight ” means that we do not disclose your Personal Data unless prior consent has been obtained and we have administrative, physical and Information Technology (IT) security measures to protect your Personal Data.
This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights which any member of the Ascott Group may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data. This Policy does not affect any rights which we may have at law in connection with the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, nothing in this Policy establishes any joint and several liability on the part of the Ascott Group members.
1.      Your Personal Data
1.1.   **  “Personal Data” **refers to any data or information about you from which you can be identified either (a) from that data alone; or (b) from that data combined with other information. Examples of such Personal Data which you may provide us include (depending on the nature of your interaction with us):
a)    your name, NRIC number, passport number or other identification number, telephone number(s), mailing address, email address and any other information relating to you which you have provided us in any form you may have submitted to us, or in other forms of interaction with you;
b)    information about your use of our websites and services, including cookies, IP addresses, subscription account details and membership details;
c)    your employment history, education background, and income levels; and
d)    your payment related information, such as your bank account or credit card information, and your credit history.
In addition, if you make a reservation to be a resident at one of our serviced apartments or hotels, you may also be asked to provide further information including photo identification about yourself and your family members, such as the dates of your arrival and departure. In order to provide you with better service, we may also collect your preferences, e.g. smoking or non-smoking room, the preferred location of your apartment (low floor, high floor, etc.), type of bed, preferred newspaper etc.

Such monitoring or recording will be in accordance with applicable law.
2.2.    If you provide Personal Data of a third party (e.g. information of your dependent, spouse, children and/or parents) to us, you represent and warrant that the collection, use and disclosure of that Personal Data to us, as well as the further processing of that Personal Data by us for the purposes set out below, is lawful.
2.3.    In respect of our activities in the EU, CapitaLand Limited (Reg. No. 198900036N), the parent entity of The Ascott Limited, and The Ascott Limited are the ultimate primary data controllers for processing of the Personal Data.  CapitaLand Limited and its related corporations and affiliates are referred to hereunder as the “CapitaLand Group”.
