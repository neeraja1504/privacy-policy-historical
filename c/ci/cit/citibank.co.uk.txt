3. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?
Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third party websites. Sites that are not operated by Citi may have different approaches to privacy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies on these sites.
Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. We place advertisements by developing and using our own Marketing Segments that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use Marketing Segments provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.
Marketing segments are groups of unique individuals or users categorized using information such as behaviours, demographics, attitudes and/or geographic differences. Companies can create marketing segments by using technologies like IP addresses to compile, over time, aggregated, non-personal information about how consumers are using the internet. They consider where users saw and/or clicked on content and advertisements, and use this information to make inferences and predictions about the users' characteristics, interests and preferences. This information does not identify you personally nor does it report on particular online activities or behaviours Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy and Cookies Policy.
Companies we work with are service providers and/or agents that conduct business on behalf of Citi. The services they provide include, but are not limited to, communications (e.g., email), marketing, data processing, customer acquisition and servicing and advertisement management. When we use other service providers and/or agents to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of information they receive and to comply with any relevant laws (including data protection laws).

If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to execute certain service functions, recognize and associate you with your Citi account(s).
