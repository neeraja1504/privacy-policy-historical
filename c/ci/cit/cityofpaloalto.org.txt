Your Privacy
Privacy Notice Information
The City of Palo Alto Administrative Services, Information Technology Division, developed and manages this web site. This web site is the gateway for providing direct government-to-citizen public service provision and interaction through the use of information technology. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy on-line. The following privacy statement outlines how individual information will be handled by the City of Palo Alto while using this site.
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.
We use Log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. Our Web site logs do not collect personally identifiable information, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals who browse the web site. When you visit the City of Palo Alto web site and browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you;
The type of browser and operating system you used;
The date and time you visited this site;
The Web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
The Web site you visited prior to coming to this Web site.
If during your visit to the City of Palo Alto Web Site you participate in a survey, fill out a Web form, or send an email, the following additional information will be collected:
The email address and contents of the email; and
Information volunteered to complete a Web form or in response to a survey.
If you send us an email with a question or comment that contains personally identifiable information, or fill out a form that emails us this information, we will only use the personally identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, or to further improve our Web site. We may redirect your message to another department, division or program within the City that is in a better position to answer your question. Survey information is used only for the purpose designated.
Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.
We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an email, filling out a Web form, or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of this web site.
If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by Federal or State law.
Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.
Public Disclosure
In the State Of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by municipalities. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both State and Federal laws.
All information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
