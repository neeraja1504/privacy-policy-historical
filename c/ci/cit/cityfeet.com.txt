Cityfeet shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching Cityfeet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. Cityfeet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, Cityfeet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to Cityfeet. Professional Profile users agree to share their contact information and allow all Cityfeet users to view their contact information via the Cityfeet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. Cityfeet users who do not opt out of the Professional Directory service during registration with Cityfeet (or anytime thereafter) also agree to share their contact information via the Cityfeet Professional Directory.
Cityfeet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that Cityfeet's partners make of customer information will not exceed Cityfeet's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with VeriSign, our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. Cityfeet also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of Cityfeet, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.
Cityfeet does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, Cityfeet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in Cityfeet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While Cityfeet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, Cityfeet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
Please be aware that Cityfeet was recently acquired by CoStar Group, Inc. ("CoStar"), and as a result all Cityfeet customer information, including personal, company and listing information, has been and will be shared with CoStar. Please be aware that in the event CoStar and/or Cityfeet merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of CoStar's and/or Cityfeet's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personal, company and listing information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if Cityfeet for its own business needs, desire to use the personal information for another purpose, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personal information.
