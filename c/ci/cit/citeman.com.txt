Privacy Policy – CiteMan Network
I. Your Privacy at CiteMan Network
When registering you do not need to provide any information except the bare minimum that we need for your account: a username, email and a password. Unlike many other sites we will never sell the emails to unscrupulous spammers. In fact, we won’t sell emails or give them to anyone regardless of their scruples unless we are ordered to by law (in the extreme case that law enforcement formally requests this information we will comply with the law). We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide this information to us. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our commitment to your privacy please don’t hesitate to contact us, there is nothing we know of that we can do to show more respect for your privacy but if you think there is let us know.
II. What We Collect and Store Automatically
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. Rather, information is kept in the aggregate. We automatically collect and store only the information about your visit. We use the information we collect to understand the traffic to our site (for example, it’s important to know how much bandwidth the site uses so that we can purchase more if needed, if the “hits” to our site increase we need to pay more money for better hosting), and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.
III. If You Send Us E-mail
You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.
IV. Cookies
A) Visiting the site – If all you do is visit and surf the site no cookies are used.
B) Logging in – If you decide to use a cookie (this is done by checking the box that logs you in automatically) to save you logging in every time you visit CiteMan Network, we place a little text file called a “cookie” on your hard drive. It sits in your web browser directory. A cookie lets us store your profile information on your computer and lets our web site retrieve it when you visit our site. No other web site can use or view the cookie set by CiteMan Network. Cookies help us create a speedy web experience by remembering your user name and email information, so you don’t have to re-type it when signing in. Cookies do not store personal information and we do not use them to track your movements through our site and you do not need cookies to use this site (you will simply have to log in at every visit) it’s your choice.
C) Spell Check – The spell check has the ability to learn from you. That means that if a word is consistently marked as a misspelled word (a member’s name that is not in the dictionary for example) you can click the button “learn” in the spell checker and this word will be saved to a cookie so that it will not be marked as a misspelled word in the future. If you do not use this feature the Spell Checker does not use any cookies.
If at any time we add anything else that uses a cookie the privacy policy will be updated. If you find a cookie from our site that you think does not fall under one of those categories please contact us.
D) * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
V. Posting to the site
