We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

Contact form information: We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive via our support contact form. Such contact information and PII are not used for any other purpose aside from providing you our support and are not shared with outside parties.
Newsletter subscriber information: You can register on our website without a need to be a customer if you would like to receive our newsletter as well as be informed of updates on our new products and services and possibly news, deals, and offers from other relevant services and software companies in this niche.
We never use or share such personally identifiable information [PII] provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
In simple words:
WE COLLECT THE BARE MINIMAL NEEDED INFORMATION FROM YOU AND IT IS SAFE WITH US.
WE WILL NEVER EVER SELL, RENT OUT, OR SHARE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION OR DATA.
How Information is Used
We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:
To provide our Services: For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide you with access to a membership area, to your customer area, or charge you for any of our paid Services;
To further develop our Services: For example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;

To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations and serve relevant advertisements.
To give you the best possible service, we may use 3rd party services to provide contracted services for our business, including, but not limited to processing credit cards, hosting our website, securely sending emails, shipping products to you, or advertising. In many cases, we will need to provide some if not all the PII you provide to use so these 3rd party services can perform these services.
We may have to disclose your PII to comply with state and federal laws; to assist law enforcement and governmental agencies in preventing or investigating fraud or other crimes, or in response to a court order. In such instances, we will only provide the PII requested and your PII will only be used for legal purposes as opposed to marketing.
Finally, if we sold or transferred our business, we would transfer your PII to the purchaser as appropriate and might also retain a copy of your PII for any new business ventures we would start. In connection with any merger, the sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that CG Elves goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Who Else Accesses Your Data
When a purchase was made by a visitor or returning customer, we link such purchase behavior information stats between our eCommerce shop software and our 3rd party email provider service MailChimp (which facilitates our newsletter functionality and stores a copy of your contact data and what products you purchased from us). MailChimp stores such data as your name, email and the name of products you purchased from us, on their secure servers, so we don’t annoy you with promotions for items you already purchased from us. You may opt out of our MailChimp list/s by clicking on the designated link to do so which is present in every single email we send you using the MailChimp service). EU citizens may request we terminate and delete all such records about you from the MailChimp server.
Information Shared Publicly

That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, comments other content that you make public on our website, and your “likes” and comments on other websites that use our Services, are all available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.

Our Security Policy
We have taken steps to build our Website using sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your PII. When we collect your PII through our Website, we will encrypt your PII before it travels over the Internet using industry standards as established for conducting secure online transactions. We also use industry standard technologies such as secure routers and firewalls to make sure that your PII is safe. Unfortunately, we cannot fully guarantee secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature.
Once we receive your PII, we have industry standard security measures in place to protect against the loss or misuse of your PII, though again, we cannot fully guarantee against such loss or misuse. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our Website and not share it with anyone. You should always log out of our Website when you are done using it, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
Our website is using SSL/TSL to protect you and your data.
We use CloudFlare and LiquidWeb to help mitigate attacks on our servers.
**Additionally, we employ on our servers state-of-the-art best practice protections systems such as firewalls,  brute-force hack attack mitigation, spam protection plus other security hardening settings.
We enforce long and secure passwords for login to our site. **
We use anonymizing and pseudonymizing where suitable.
We monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
All these security measures are to keep our site and its users safe.
Disclaimer: No website is 100% safe from hackers. If ever a data breach occurs, we will notify our users, as required by GDPR laws.
We promise to notify suitable authorities of data breaches. We will also notify you if there is a threat to your rights or interests. We will do everything we reasonably can to prevent security breaches and to assist authorities should any breaches occur.
While no online service is 100% secure, and even banks and government systems get hacked, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.
To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to follow the advice below.
What you personally can do to help reduce the risk of a data breach :
Stick to a long and safe password for your logins. A good one consists of 18 or more characters and numbers as well as special
symbols. Never use a simple short password like Joe123, as these get hacked in seconds.
Do not share your login information with anyone, avoid posting it onlne or saving it publicly in any manner someone may find it.
We recommend using LastPass.com to safely save all your logins and sensitive data.
Use a VPN to safeguard your Internet connection from cyber-attackers.
TIP : Avoid using the same login email and password to more than a single site or service. Using Facebook, Google and similar social media as your logins to other sites and services puts you at great risk should your mobile number get hijacked by cyber criminals. They will then be able to reset your social/Gmail/similar email account and thereafter gain access to all services used by that email with the new password they set.
Best practices : Use one email account for banking related logins and another for phone verification for your social accounts and a third email account for additional sites and services you need to login to.
.
Use of Credit Cards
You may have to provide a credit card to buy products and services from our Website. We use third-party billing services such as PayPal and HAVE NO CONTROL over these services. We do not have access to nor store on our servers any of your financial information. We use our commercially reasonable efforts to make sure that your credit card number is kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.
