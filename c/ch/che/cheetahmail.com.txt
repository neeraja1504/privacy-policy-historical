While we do not do so at this time, we reserve the right to use cookies or similar technologies to serve online advertising on our websites and to identify unique customers or prior blog respondents. We may work with advertising partners to deliver targeted advertising related to Cheetah Digital's own products and services. To facilitate targeted advertising, we and our third-party partners may utilize "cookies" or equivalent identifiers (explained above) and other audience matching technologies.

In addition, third parties may collect data about browsing activities on our websites and other unrelated websites over time, for online targeted advertising purposes.
Our advertising partners may place a pixel tag or cookie on certain websites, such as a website registration page. This enables our partner companies to later display a relevant advertisement to you based on your website browsing behavior. This type of online, targeted advertising — known as "retargeting" — is used to re-engage consumers who previously visited a website. To measure the effectiveness of the online targeted advertising you see, we partner with companies to evaluate your interactions with the ads. Certain information may be collected and shared with these partners, including what ad you received, when you viewed it and whether you clicked on the ad.
You can opt-out of online targeted advertising from companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program through the  DAA Consumer Choice page , which is available in versions for desktop and mobile browsers. The DAA also offers a separate choice tool for the collection of cross-app data on mobile devices for online targeted advertising and other applicable uses. To exercise choice applicable to companies participating in this choice tool, you can install the DAA's  AppChoices app. European residents may opt-out of targeted advertising using the  IAB Europe opt-out platform.
Please ensure you review the opt-out choices available to you within the applicable policies on other Cheetah Digital owned, affiliated, or operated websites.
