Privacy Policy
Last updated - April 15th 2018
CheckPeople ("CheckPeople" or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the CheckPeople.com website, the CheckPeople.com service, and any software applications made available by CheckPeople, such as any mobile device application CheckPeople makes available (together, the "Service"). CheckPeople has published this "Privacy Policy" to show its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.
This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service, and not to any websites or services of third parties ("Third Party Websites"), which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is only applicable to personal information provided by you to CheckPeople, or collected by CheckPeople as part of your use of the Service , and not to any information that may be available in a public background record or report accessible by you or others through the Service.
By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy and CheckPeople's separate Terms of Service document (the "Terms of Service"), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service document is available here.
__No Permission Without Agreement_. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using or accessing the Service._
Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time you use the Service, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy and review any changes since the last time you used the Service.
Although most changes are likely to be minor, CheckPeople reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting a new version on this page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately on posting. Unless CheckPeople obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy
CheckPeople does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If CheckPeople obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, CheckPeople will immediately delete such information from its database. Because CheckPeople does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, CheckPeople has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. CheckPeople has designed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
Traffic Data. Like most website and mobile application operators, CheckPeople automatically gathers information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that is not meant to personally identify you.
Cookie Policy. "Cookies" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service. CheckPeople uses two types of Cookies: "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."
First Party Cookies. CheckPeople uses first-party Cookies on the Service, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and (2) to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service. However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
Third Party Cookies and Advertising.
Advertising on Third Party Websites. CheckPeople may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service. We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, Inc. ("Google"), may use first party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), third party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion tracking pixel, see https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting).
Google Analytics. Google Analytics is Google's analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the "__ga" cookie. CheckPeople uses Google Analytics on the CheckPeople.com website.
Data Collection by Third Parties. Any of these third parties may place Cookies on your computer or mobile device, use web beacons (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon), and gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to deliver relevant metrics and content.
Opting Out of Third Party Cookies. You may customize your Google Cookies preferences or opt out of using Google Cookies on the Google Ads Settings page at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. You may learn about Facebook Cookies and how to customize your preferences at https://www.facebook.com/about/ads. You may opt out of using other third parties' Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. You can also learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at http://www.aboutcookies.org/.

In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Service will not gather it secretly. CheckPeople may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to CheckPeople.

Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. CheckPeople reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of CheckPeople's assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and an opportunity to affirmatively opt out of it.

CheckPeople takes security seriously. We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure of your Personal Information.

Before visiting or providing Personal Information to Third Party Websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of those Third Party Websites, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.

Any information submitted in connection with Promotional Activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, CheckPeople may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help CheckPeople improve the Service. Any Personal Information provided to CheckPeople in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in aggregated form.
In the event CheckPeople goes through a business transition, including without limitation any merger, acquisition, partnership, business reorganization, debt finance, or sale of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership (together a "Business Transition"), CheckPeople may use information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to its restrictions, as part of any such Business Transition.
