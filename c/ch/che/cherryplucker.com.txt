Privacy Policy
Cherryplucker.com takes your privacy very seriously. This policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it when you visit cherryplucker.com. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
Routine Information Collection
All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as AOL or Verizon FIOS), browser details, timestamps, pages visited, and referring pages (how you got here.) None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and lets us know what pages and information are useful and helpful to visitors.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Where necessary, this site uses cookies to store information about a visitor’s preferences and history in order to better serve the visitor with customized content. That way the site will be relevant to you.
Advertising partners and other third parties may also use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitors to our site in order to display advertisements and other useful information (such as displaying car ads to someone frequenting dealership sites.) This kind of tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies. You can visit NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) to opt out of behavioral advertising from many advertisers across the Web. Keep in mind this doesn’t stop you from seeing ads, they will just no longer be based on your page viewing habits.

The best option is to disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.
