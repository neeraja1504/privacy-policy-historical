Privacy Policy - CheapAirportParking.org
This privacy policy describes how the websites maintained by the Effective Air Communications collect and utilize information supplied by our visitors. This policy may change from time to time as may be appropriate. You can use CheapAirportParking.org without disclosing any personal identifying information about yourself. However, we offer some special services such as site Subscription via email, online Form and Publication Requests. In order for these services to work properly, we must collect some basic information from you. If you submit any personal identifying information to us, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease or share this information with anyone else, except as follows: (1) as may be required by the California General Laws, including the Public Records Law; (2) in the course of a law enforcement investigation; or (3) in the event of a suspected attempt to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (an attack by hackers, for example).
Web Server Activity Logs
Like most web servers on the Internet, our servers collect and store all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web page including:
The name, domain and numerical address of the "host" computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet;
The date and time you accessed our site;
The Internet address of the web page you came from;
The page you requested and the amount of data sent to your computer;
The information your web browser sends to us, which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate operating system and the type of CPU in your system.
It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information.
We develop summary reports, or logs, from the information collected. These logs are analyzed periodically in order to study site usage over time and to perform studies in order to improve the site's organization, performance and usefulness. The raw data used to develop these logs are erased periodically as a part of routine system maintenance.
Email
When you send us personal identifying information via email (that is, in a message, question or comment or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information), we exclusively use it to respond to your request. We will never share your email with third parties. The email itself may be retained as required by California Laws and regulations governing the retention of public records.
