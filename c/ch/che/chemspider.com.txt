Security
The RSC takes care to protect the data it collects about site users, using Secure Site License-approved technology where appropriate. Pages that use this technology are flagged with a padlock symbol as shown.
Cookies
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.

Within registration to allow you to access stored information.
** Persistent cookies** remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
To help us recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly;
To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way;
Within research surveys to ensure you are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often or after you have already done so.
** Third-party cookies** are used to control page content for a specific user:
To serve advertisements on our sites and track whether these advertisements are clicked on by users;
To control how often you are shown a particular advertisement;
To tailor content to your preferences;
To count the number of anonymous users of our sites;
To provide security within shopping baskets, e.g. to pay for a membership subscription or a journal pay-per-view.
