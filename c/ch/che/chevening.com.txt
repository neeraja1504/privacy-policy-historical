Security
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration form asks users to enter personal information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web. If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to chevening.online@britishcouncil.org
