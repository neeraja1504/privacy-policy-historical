If you do not want us to use your personal data for marketing purposes, you may opt-out by sending an email request to unsubscribe@checkmarx.com. Please note that even if you opt-out, we may still use your data for non-marketing purposes (for example to fulfill your requests, communicate with you and respond to your inquiries, etc.).
From time to time, we may conduct surveys or test features, and analyze the data we have to develop, evaluate and improve these features, in order to better understand our customers and to improve our website, products and services.

We share your information with our third party service providers, such as web hosting providers, storage, customer management, analytics, survey and email service providers. These third parties may have access to your personal data so that they may provide these services on our behalf but they are not permitted by us to use your personal data for any other purpose.
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any data about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our or a third party’s property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may share your data if we enter into a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of some or all of our assets. Any party that acquires our assets as part of such a transaction may continue to use your data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
