Chemical Engineering :: Privacy Policy
Since your privacy is a priority to us, we have provided this detailed policy statement about privacy and information dissemination practices related to TradeFair Group, Inc., or its parent, Access Intelligence, products. Of course, our site visitors may enjoy many of our features and activities without providing any personal information.
Information Collection & Use
(1) When you register for one of our products (subscription forms, site memberships, trade show attendance, newsletter subscriptions, etc.), our forms may ask for contact and demographic information. This information is used to send news about our products or promotional material from other carefully screened businesses. You will be able to opt out of receiving any mailings. In addition, demographic information may be used to customize the display of our sites to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past visits.
(2) Your browser offers so-called "cookies," which — if you allow their use — store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. And when you re-visit our sites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. Cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information. Our sites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function within your web browser. However, some advanced features use cookies to assist in keeping track of your location within the site in order to provide navigational trails and similar navigational features. These cookies are not used to personally identify your surfing patterns and are merely used to provide navigation links. Disabling your cookies simply means that some of these features will not have custom navigation available to you.
(3) Some of the banner ads displayed in our sites are provided by outside companies. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies associated with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you.
Information Sharing & Disclosure
Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is not disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party. Other information: While we will primarily use your email address to contact you when your subscription is up for renewal or to provide you additional information regarding your trade show registration, there are a few other types of messages we may want to send you, either by email or other means. These might include (but aren't limited to) announcements regarding other TradeFair Group, Inc. or corporate parent Access Intelligence products or services, and special offers from carefully selected, relevant third-party businesses and organizations. You will be able to opt out of any such mailings. In addition, we do share non-personal, aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, demographics, traffic patterns, and related site information with advertisers and reputable third-party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes; however, none of the information we disclose in this aggregate form can be used to personally identify you.
