Chemical Network
ChemNet.com and its provider, Zhejiang NetSun Co., Ltd., (collectively, "ChemNet") are committed to protecting the privacy of its members and the security of the member information. This commitment is reflected in the way ChemNet collects and uses the information and in the measures ChemNet adopts to protect the information.
The information ChemNet collects shall be:
Necessary for members to enjoy the service on ChemNet. One example is the information concerning a trade or an intent to trade.
Beneficial to the members. We wish to provide information to offer the most enjoyable experience for the members on ChemNet.
ChemNet is a service dedicated to meeting the business needs of companies. A member account on ChemNet is associated with the company, not the individual making the application. The only information identifying a person that is required by ChemNet is the name of the contact person, used by ChemNet strictly for contacting the company the person represents and only for business purposes.
ChemNet collects and stores basic information in its database about the member companies, as supplied by the members, postings, communication between members through ChemNet, trading records, records of contracts made and other business information supplied by the members. The information is either necessary for ChemNet to provide its service, or can be presumed to be distributed to a wide audience for the benefit of the members.
ChemNet fully recognizes the importance of the confidentiality of the member information, particularly the trading records of the members. Both technical measures and administrative ones, as permitted under the local regulations, are taken to protect the security and confidentiality of the relevant data.
No data on any member will be sold, rented or otherwise made available to parties outside Zhejiang NetSun Co., Ltd., the company providing the ChemNet service, except when:
Disclosing the information is required by a court order or an administrative order.
Disclosing the information to a third party is necessary for the service on ChemNet to proceed.
The information is intended to be made available to other parties, such as the description of the company as provided by the member.
Disclosing the information is necessary for ChemNet to verify the authenticity of data provided by the member.
The information being disclosed is legally and publicly available.
Occasionally, ChemNet may reveal the corporate names of some of its members in its marketing efforts.
ChemNet may use internally aggregated data for improving the service to the members. Also, ChemNet may publish compiled statistics with no reference to any particular member or members for marketing purpose.
All possible technical measures have been taken to ensure that the trading records of a member are accessible only to the one holding the password of the member, as well as to designated officers of ChemNet for administrative purposes only; and that each record of contract is viewable only by the parties making the contract, as well as designated officers of ChemNet for administrative purposes only. As ChemNet, and the majority of the services available on ChemNet, uses the password/account name pair to identify a member, it is highly suggested that members keep their passwords secure to ensure the confidentiality of their data.
ChemNet strives to protect the privacy of its members and the security and confidentiality of their data. However, because of the nature of the Internet, ChemNet expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind regarding the privacy of the members or the security and confidentiality of the data of its members.
ChemNet reserves the right of final interpretation of this policy and the right to modify this policy. Updated policies will be effective when made publicly available on Chemnet's websites.
