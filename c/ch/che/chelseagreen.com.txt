For website users, details of any referring website or exit pages as well as broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location) may also be collected.

We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our website for our visitors.

We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable information: first and last name, e-mail address, street address and phone number.
Volunteered information is kept strictly confidential. Chelsea Green Publishing does not share or sell personally identifiable information to other companies.

We maintain appropriate and reasonable safeguards to ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of the information in our possession.
You may opt not to be included in the e-mail announcements or mailings when you register for one of our offerings. If a particular registration form does not have this option, or, if you’d like to be removed from our lists for any reason, notify Chelsea Green directly by emailing web@chelseagreen.com. Please include your name, e-mail address so that we can effectively remove you from the database.
