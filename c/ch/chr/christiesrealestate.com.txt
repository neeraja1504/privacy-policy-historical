Strictly necessary: These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website; many of the functions on our website will not work properly, or at all, if you do not allow these cookies to be used. We may therefore be unable to provide many of the services you may wish to request unless you accept the use of these cookies.
Performance: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often.

Functionality: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features (for example, remembering changes you have made to text size and fonts).
If you reside outside the EU, we also use a fourth type of cookie for Targeting or Advertising:
Targeting or Advertising: We sometimes partner with third parties to deliver more relevant advertisements and to compile web statistics. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technology to monitor your visits to both Christie’s International Real Estate and other websites.

Provide advertisers with information about your visit to our websites so they can show you advertising that is relevant to you.
Limit the number of times you see an advertisement.
Help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

Your Security Is Important to Us
An increasingly common scam—called "phishing"—uses official-looking emails to deceive consumers into disclosing their personal information. The email often directs the recipient to a "look-alike" website of a legitimate business, tricking consumers into thinking they are responding to a valid request.
To avoid getting caught in any of these scams, it is recommended that you remember to take the actions below.  We cannot guarantee, however that by taking the below actions you will prevent dangerous spam causing you harm:
Keep your password secret and change it periodically.
Never give out your vital account information by email or telephone, unless you initiated the contact. Christie's International Real Estate never sends emails asking for personal information.
