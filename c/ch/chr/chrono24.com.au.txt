Google then analyzes the user's behavior for us and provides us with reports about the user’s activities. We personally create no user profiles from the reports received by Google that would enable specific users and their personal data to be identified.
Although additional functions are added to Google Analytics with Universal Analytics, this does not mean that a limitation of data protection measures, such as IP masking or browser add-on, are connected (see 9a).
