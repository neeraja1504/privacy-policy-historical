On our Web Sites, you may have an opportunity to post user-generated content using social networking tools available on those sites. If you take advantage of this opportunity, remember that the user-generated content you post is available to others who visit the Web Site and therefore you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to such content. In addition, you may choose to use certain features on our Web Sites for which we partner with other entities. These features, which may include social networking and geographic location tools, are operated by third parties that are not affiliated with C.H. Robinson.

We strongly suggest you review the third parties' privacy policies if you use the relevant features.
We may also disclose information about you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order, or a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of our Web Sites; to enforce or apply our Web Sites' terms of use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.
We also reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of one of our Web Sites to another organization or if we merge with another organization. If such a transfer occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner consistent with this policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information about you.

We therefore cannot guarantee that information about you will not be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. C.H. Robinson never collects information for third party commercial marketing purposes nor does it create individual profiles or provide your information to any third party organization. C.H. Robinson will only share your information with third parties when and as you request or as otherwise required by law.
