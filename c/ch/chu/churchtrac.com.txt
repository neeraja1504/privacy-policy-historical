For our EU customers, a 'controller' means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
A 'processor' means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
With the exception of basic information gathered during the signup process or email forms, ChurchTrac, Inc. is classified as a data processor. Churches using services by ChurchTrac are acting as the data controller. A data subject who wishes to revoke consent for his or her personal data therefore will contact the data controller (you or your church) to initiate the request, even if such data lives on the servers belonging to the data processor (ChurchTrac).
