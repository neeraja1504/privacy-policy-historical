To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:

Payment security
We use the AW Payment Service Provider system. All transaction information passed between merchant sites and the AW systems are encrypted using 128-bit SSL certificates. Sounds complicated, we know.

Your details are not disclosed to any third parties without your consent.
