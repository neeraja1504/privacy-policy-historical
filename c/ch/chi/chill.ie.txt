This process includes the use of information you provide to Chill in your online quote form.

This may include special categories of data, where relevant, such as Health Data or Criminal Convictions and offences data such as penalty point data.
You have the right to human intervention to express your interests and contest automated decisions.

Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA
Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA.
Transfer it to organisations that are compliant with the EU/US Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to those used and expected within the EEA.

13. Security
Chill Insurance will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use reasonable procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
