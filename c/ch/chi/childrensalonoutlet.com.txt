Marketing
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You can view and make certain decisions about your personal data use in the “my account” section of the website, or by contacting us.
Promotional offers from us
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased [goods or services] from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and in each case you have consented to our communicating with you for these purposes.
Third-party marketing
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Childrensalon group of companies for marketing purposes.
Opting out
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time [by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out/unsubscribe links on any electronic marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time].
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of [a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions].
