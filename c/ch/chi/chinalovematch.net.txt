CLM.NET 'cookie' policy
As a default, we use a feature of your browser called a 'cookie' to assign a user ID. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from the site you are visiting and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are very common and completely normal throughout the Internet. Cookies do not harm your computer nor can they access information stored on your computer. The primary purpose of cookies is to maintain your customized settings on a site. Members that do not accept cookies will be able to log on to the site, but profile identifying information will appear in browser URLs and may compromise account security.
Balancing Members’ Privacy Needs and Rights:
1. Please note that as a general policy, CLM.NET does not review the content of private e-mail messages or screen the Profiles posted by CLM.NET members (although it may periodically review the information posted in the public areas of the service) and accepts no responsibility for resolving disputes between members.
2. CLM.NET receives communications from members concerning other members. These may be testimonials, complaints or general information. CLM.NET aims to be as open as possible with all its members, without compromising the privacy of any individuals.
3. If you complain about another member, we may advise that member that a complaint about him / her has been received. However, we will not tell the member who made the complaint without your express permission. Further, if we suspect that the member would be able to identify who made the complaint, we will not advise that a complaint has been made unless we have your express permission.
4. When a complaint about a member is received, no action will be taken unless the complaint is substantiated by evidence. However, a record of the complaint may be made and included in the data held about that member.
5. Communications between two members will be released to either member on request. They will not be released to third parties.
6. If another member has written 'private notes' about you, CLM.NET considers that those notes were written for that member's use only, and to display them to others would be a violation of that member's privacy. Those notes will not as a rule be released to you, even if you request all information held by CLM.NET about you.
