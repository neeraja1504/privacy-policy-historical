CHI: Privacy Statement
Privacy Statement for
Cultural Homestay International
Cultural Homestay International has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.

Information This Site Gathers/Tracks and How We Use It
The Cultural Homestay International Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. IP addresses are logged by us to track a user's session. This gives Cultural Homestay International an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous, except for suspected cases of abuse or harassment.
On certain pages, such as the Request For Further Information forms, we ask users to provide us with their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, demographic, and other personal information. This personal information is only gathered by us with the user's knowing and active permission and participation.
We review and discard the information in some cases, while in others we may use the information to tailor our user's Web experience, generate anonymous statistics, or to contact users via email or postal mail (e.g. to send newsletters, further information on our programs, etc.) at their request.
