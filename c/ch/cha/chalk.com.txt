Privacy Policy | Chalk
At Chalk.com Education Inc., doing business as Chalk, your right to privacy is very important to us. We provide you with the ability to create, share, edit, access, manage, print, provide feedback on or have conversations about lesson plans, assessments, curriculum, standards, and assessment results (the “Service”). We collect certain specific information from you, and we also automatically collect information and data relating to the usage of our services by all our users, including you which provides us with aggregate data that Chalk uses to improve the Services. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy rights and the information you provide to us, we have developed this privacy policy. It explains how we will protect your information and describes how we will use and share it.
This policy is concerned with the protection of your personal information only. Personal information includes any data that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as your name, e-mail address, income, personal opinion, interests, home contact information, identification numbers, user IDs, passwords, ethnic origin, and age. Under Canadian law, in a business context, personal information does not include the name, job title, business address, or business telephone number of any employee in an organization.
Additionally, Chalk automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users’ access to the Services. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the aggregate trends they reveal about our customers and how the customers use the Services. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users.
Chalk may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographic composition of our user base and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about Chalk. This aggregate information does not identify specific users.
This policy describes the following practices:
Collecting your personal information
Use of your personal information
Sharing your personal information

These integrations are to facilitate the transfer of education related data, such as subjects and class enrollment, assessment results, or learning content and may require your personal information to ensure accounts in each system are synchronized.

Use of your personal information
Chalk does not sell or rent any of your personal information to any third-party for any purpose – including for advertising or marketing purposes. Chalk does not share personal information with third-parties except in the limited circumstances set forth in the section “Sharing your personal Information.” Personal information collected from and about students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best Chalk experience. More specifically, this information is used to:
Allow access to the Service
Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features
Respond to your emails, submissions, questions, requests for information or customer support
Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it
Send you information about features on our Service or changes to our policies and Services
Help connect you with your students and their parents/guardians within the Service
Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure
We use automatically collected information (described in the “Collecting Information” section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.
Sharing your personal information
Subject to any exceptions stated above in the collection of information section, should Chalk collect any of your personal information, we will follow these practices regarding the distribution of that information.
Your personal information is always protected
Chalk uses reasonable precautions to protect your personal information and store it securely. Access to your personal information is restricted to those personnel who need it, and Chalk takes reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.
Chalk only uses and discloses your personal information if it helps us facilitate your needs, improve our products and services, meet legal and regulatory requirements, or — to the limited extent possible — manage our internal business operations. Additionally, if there are any disclosure or use restrictions in your consent to the collection of your personal information, Chalk will abide by those restrictions (subject to the consent exceptions listed below).
For example, your credit card information will only be used to bill you for the services that your have authorized or used. The account information provided as part of your registration for Chalk’s services will only be used to provide you with the services.
Chalk may combine your information with other information into an aggregate form, so your information no longer personally identifies you. We may then disclose the aggregate information to third parties, so they can obtain an overall picture of Chalk’s products, services, customer usage patterns and/or other statistical information.
Finally, Chalk makes use of secure transfer protocols (HTTPS, SFTP, etc.) when communicating between the client (your computer or mobile device) and the server (hosted on Google’s Cloud Platform in the United States) so that your personal information is protected even during transit.
We only share your information with your consent
Chalk provides your information to third parties only for purposes to which you have consented, and we require such third parties to keep your information confidential.
In a few situations, Chalk may be required to disclose your information without your prior consent. For example, Chalk may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:
comply with law or legal process
protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights and property of a third party
protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any of Chalk’s products, software, services, or other proprietary materials
protect the personal safety of any person
allow for a change of ownership of Chalk and associated transfer of all personal information to the new owner of Chalk – this does not affect the protection of your information under this Privacy Policy
Chalk will always try to provide you with prior notice of such disclosure; however, such notice may not always be possible or reasonable given the circumstances.
Additionally, the nature of the Services provided requires the routine use of your information in the provision of the Services. Your personal information will only be used to the limited extent necessary to provide the Services that you have requested, and may include the following uses:
to allow third party suppliers, vendors, contractors and other parties to provide products and services to us or to you, or to otherwise act on our behalf (this may include, without limitation, our authorization of such third parties to e-mail our users regarding updates, surveys and other inquiries regarding their experience with our software and service); and
to allow for advertising and other audits, and surveys to, among other things, validate the size and composition of the users of Chalk’s services, and understand their experience with Chalk’s software and service. This may require, among other things, disclosing your access history and/or disclosing records showing which lesson plans or materials were viewed or used by which users.
Sharing your information through an integration with a third party software provider
Occasionally, Chalk is implemented into an environment where it is integrated with a Student Information System or Learning Management System provided by a third-party software provider. These integrations are to facilitate the transfer of education related data, such as subjects and class enrollment, assessment results, or learning content and may require your personal information to ensure accounts in each system are synchronized. Your consent to use the Service includes consent for any third-party software provider to receive your personal information from us to enable those integrations.
