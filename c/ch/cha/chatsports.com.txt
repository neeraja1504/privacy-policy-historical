These sources may include companies whom we have engaged in accordance with Section 5 to provide that information based on information that you have provided to us, from our Community IM partners, from the third-party messenger services that you access through Chat Sports, or from other partners such as in connection with a co-branded website or a promotion. Chat Sports may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Websites.
