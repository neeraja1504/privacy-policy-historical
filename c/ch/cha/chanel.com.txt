CHANEL POLICIES
CHANEL highly cares about your privacy and data protection.
We are committed to offering the highest standards of products and services. Thus, we value each of our existing or prospective client and aim at maintaining the best protection for your personal data
The CHANEL Online Privacy Policy explains how CHANEL collects, processes and protects your personal data when you use our website/app, when you purchase CHANEL products via our website/app, or when you apply for a job at CHANEL online as required by the data protection laws in the countries in which we do business and in particular with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679 - “GDPR”).

We have implemented a robust data protection compliance program, which includes the adoption of the high-standard data protection principles of the GDPR at a global level and includes the:
1. adoption of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”), which should ensure the same level of protection by all CHANEL entities, and to allow transfers of personal data within CHANEL’s organization globally. (For the moment, our BCRs are still under consideration for approval by the data protection authorities);
2. creation of a Data Protection Office and a network of local data protection contacts;
3. adoption of internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations;
4. implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles.
The CHANEL websites are operated by CHANEL SAS in France ("CHANEL" or "we"). CHANEL may further share information with its affiliates in accordance with the safeguards foreseen in this policy.
Any online sales on the e-commerce section of this website are made by CHANEL SAS. For the UK in particular, sales are made by CHANEL Limited, a UK company.
All marketing communications are sent to you by CHANEL SAS. For the UK in particular, all marketing communications are sent to you by CHANEL Limited.
