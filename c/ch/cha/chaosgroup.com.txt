Privacy Policy for reCAPTCHA
Invisible Captcha, or reCAPTCHA, requires end-users to click a button that says “I’m not a robot” and Google can determine whether to prompt the user with additional question (i.e. select pictures that best describe X) to verify if that person is in fact not a robot.
How “Invisible Captcha” Works - reCAPTCHA collects personal information from users to make this determination of whether they’re human and not a bot.
So, what personal information does the reCAPTCHA collect?
First, the reCAPTCHA algorithm will check to see if there’s any cookie placed on the computer being used.
Then, an additional reCAPTCHA-specific cookie will be added to the user’s browser, and a complete snapshot of the user’s browser window at that moment in time will be captured, pixel by pixel.
Some of the browser and user information collected at this time includes:
All cookies placed over the last 6 months,
How many mouse clicks you’ve made on that screen (or touches if on a touch device),
The CSS information for that page,
The date,
The language your browser is set to,
Any plug-ins you have installed on the browser, and
All Javascript objects
It’s because of this personal information collection that the requirement by CalOPPA is triggered and a Privacy Policy is required when reCAPTCHA is integrated.
EU User Consent Policy
When using our products that incorporate this policy, certain disclosures must be given to and consents obtained from end users in the European Union where EU data protection law requires such disclosures and consents.
You must use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose clearly, and obtain consent to, any data collection, sharing and usage that takes place on any site, app, email publication or other property as a consequence of your use of our products;
You must use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that an end user is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the end user’s device where such activity occurs in connection with a product to which this policy applies.
Changes to this policy
From time to time we may make changes to this privacy policy. If we make any substantial changes to this privacy policy and the way in which we use your personal data we will post these changes on this page. Please check our privacy policy on a regular basis.
