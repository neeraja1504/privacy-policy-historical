Aggregate Data
In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors, Posters, Users and our Services, we may analyze your information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Site and/or the Services.  This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Additional Uses
We also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to provide our Site and Services to you; to personalize your experience; to maintain and improve our Site, and Services; to solicit your feedback; to update you about the hackathons we power; to award prizes related to our Services; and to inform you about our products and services and those of our third-party marketing partners.
Sharing with Third Parties
Like many businesses, we contract with other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose Information, including personal information in some cases, to certain types of third-party companies, but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services, including, without limitation, hosting provider, analytics tools, customer support services, marketing and transactional email services, and payment processing.  We may also disclose your information, including any personal information, to any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us in order to support delivery of our products and services.
Opt-Out for Direct Marketing
You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes by e-mailing the instructions to this email address: support@devpost.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request
Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences
You may access, review, and/or make changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by logging in on the Site, clicking on your username, and then clicking "settings".
In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Devpost marketing e-mails.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases.  You cannot opt-out of receiving transactional e-mails related to your account with Devpost. If you provide personal information to us that is contained in a submission to a hackathon, such information may not be edited after the competition submission deadline until the conclusion of the hackathon, per the rules of each competition. Requests to remove such information from a submission may be made after a hackathon is over by emailing us at support@devpost.com.
Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, dissolution, or similar corporate event or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected and/or received, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or to the acquiring entity.  All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Disclosures to Public Authorities
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.
Children
Devpost is not directed at children under thirteen years of age, the Site does not knowingly accept registrations from children under thirteen years of age and we do not intend to collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age. We recommend that children under the age of thirteen ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. If you suspect that your child under the age of thirteen has created an account on the Site and/or provided us any personal information, please let us know by e-mailing support@devpost.com, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
Although Devpost does not knowingly accept registrations from children under the age of thirteen through the Site and the Services, children under the age of thirteen minors can still enter and win contests by having their parents or guardians register on the Site on their behalf. In cases where a hackathon is open to children under the age of thirteen, those representing children under the age of thirteen will be required to submit a parental consent notice before their child’s submissions will be eligible to win the contest.
Security
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Devpost takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail or other electronic means. You, too, need to strive to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.
Retention of Personal Information
We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purposes for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, subsequently authorized, or as allowed under applicable law.
Archives
Devpost may keep copies of user information, or other content provided by you, after their removal from the Site in archive storage, but in no event for more than 30 days. This archive storage may include past versions of stored items that have since been modified or deleted.
Links to External Sites
Our Site may contain links to external websites of interest (“External Websites”). However, once you have used these links to leave our Site you should note that we do not have any control over the External Websites. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such External Websites and such External Websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy policy applicable to the External Website in question.
