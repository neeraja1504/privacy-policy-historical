Privacy Policy | charity: water
Our commitment to privacy
charity: water knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate you trusting that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy explains our practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by charity: water. It applies to donor information that we collect both online and offline.
We have updated our Privacy Policy to take into account the new requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which means if you are a resident of the EU and your donor records reflect that address, you may be entitled to certain additional protections in accordance with GDPR.
What information is collected by charity: water?
We collect personal information when you voluntarily submit it to us.
For example, donors may provide us with personal information (such as name, address, email address, telephone numbers and/or credit/debit card information). If a donor, or a website visitor, contacts us by email they may provide us with their email address, and name. Providing data is required in these contexts in order for us to process your donations, requests, or respond to inquiries.
In addition to the personal information that you submit to us, we may collect personal information about you from reputable third parties, or automatically collect information using the following technologies:
Web Server Logs. Our web servers may collect certain information such as IP address, pages visited, time of visits, and referring website.
Cookies. Cookies are simple text files stored by your web browser that provide a method of distinguishing among donors and visitors to the website. charity: water uses cookies to identify your browser as you visit pages on the charity: water website or sites in the charity: water media network. Cookies also allow charity: water to provide more relevant, targeted content as you travel through sites in the charity: water media network as appropriate and are used on our ordering website to keep track of the items in your shopping cart.
Where do we transfer and store information?
charity: water is based in the United States, and any information transmitted to us may be stored, accessed, or processed in the United States. Residents of some other countries, including residents of the European Union, should be aware that the laws of the United States do not offer the same protections as the laws of your home country.
How do we use information?
We collect information primarily to accept donations, complete our charitable projects, and provide you with information concerning our programs, projects, and activities. We also use information for internal purposes (to better understand our supporter network) and for analytical purposes (to respond to requests for information or merchandise and to improve our website, donor base, and outreach). We may inform you of other purposes at the time that we collect some forms of information. For example, if you apply for a job we may collect information in order to process your job application.
With whom do we share information?
We do not trade, share, or sell information that you provide to us with other organizations who intend to use it only to market their products or services to you.
There may be instances in which we share your information with others. We may share your information, for example, in conjunction with your sponsorship of a certain project, as required by law, with law enforcement, to comply with legal process, to protect our legal rights, to protect the safety or security of a person, or to protect against fraud, criminal acts, or misconduct. We may also share your information with companies that provide us with services, or with a successor legal entity.
Our commitment to data security
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. For example, we secure our machines with mandated encryption protocols to secure our user/company data. We also use industry accepted tools and techniques such as SSL and two-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. Additionally, all sensitive information is stored in secure repositories both in-house as well as secure cloud-based, AES encrypted web apps.
Your access to data, and your choices
If you would like to access the data that we received from you, or make corrections to it, you may contact us at the email or mailing addresses provided at the end of this policy.
If you registered to receive communications from us and later change your mind, you may ask that your name and contact information be removed from our distribution list. You can send such a request to the email or mailing addresses at the end of this policy.
Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be "tracked" online. At this time we do not modify your experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.
