Cookies and IP addresses
Cookies are text files placed on your computer by your web browser or by Adobe Flash applications (also known as Local Shared Objects) to collect visitor behaviour information. This information is used to track your use of the website, to compile statistical reports on website activity and to allow the website to be customised.  We may also match information gathered from cookies to the information you choose to give about yourself when you register an account on the website.
The use of cookies also enables us to recognise you when you return to the website. This saves you time because you will not have to fill in forms that you have already completed and it helps us to understand what interests you on the website which allows us to make the information we provide relevant to you.
You can set your browser not to accept cookies or Local Shared Objects and the websites below tell you how to remove these from your browser.  However, in a few cases some of our website features may not function as a result.
We may also log your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to help diagnose problems with our servers, for system administration, for security and law-enforcement purposes. We do not link these addresses to any person’s name or other identifying information, unless required to do so by law.

Third party advertising cookies
Most of the advertisements you see on our sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of other third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once.  These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.  Some of the information obtained from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes.  The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies and Channel 5 does not have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served and we have no role to play in these cookies (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website).
If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine.  Here are links to the main third party advertising platforms we use, each of which have instructions on how to do this:
