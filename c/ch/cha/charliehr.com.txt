WHERE WE STORE PERSONAL DATA ABOUT YOU
The information we obtain from you and your Users (including, without limitation, Client Data) may be moved to and stored at a destination within the European Economic Area (" EEA "). Staff members operating within the EEA who work for or on behalf of us may process this information. Such staff members may, among other things, be involved in the processing of payment details, the provision of support services and the delivery of your and your Users’ request(s) for us to provide services. When submitting your and your Users’ personal data, you are agreeing to such processing, transfer or storage as outlined above. We will ensure at all times to take all reasonable steps necessary to maintain the security of your data in accordance with this privacy policy.
Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that the information we obtain from you and your Users (including, without limitation, Client Data) may be processed by our service providers based in, countries outside of the EEA for the purposes of providing you with the Service. Such countries do not always provide the same level of data protection as the UK; however where such transfers of data occur, we do put in place contracts that include security obligations on our service providers to ensure that your and your Users’ personal data is protected in accordance with UK standards.
We store the data you and your Users provide us with on our secure servers. In the event of us giving you or your Users (or you/they choosing) a password which grants you/them access to specific areas within our Website or Service, it remains your/their responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of this password. This includes the responsibility to refrain from sharing your/their password with other parties.
Because the transmission of data via the Internet cannot be assumed completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any of your or your Users’ data transmitted to our Website or Service; you are therefore responsible for any risk associated with such transmission. We will however at all times take all reasonable steps to ensure the transmission of your and your Users’ data is executed as securely as possible, and upon receipt of your/their data we will continue at all times to enforce strict security procedures and features in an attempt to prevent any unauthorised access.
