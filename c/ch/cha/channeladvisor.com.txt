IV. USE AND DISCLOSURE INFORMATION
Data Integrity; Choice. ChannelAdvisor will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by a User or to investigate and address technical issues. ChannelAdvisor will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current. ChannelAdvisor will: (a) notify users of ChannelAdvisor’s website if their personal information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the User; and (b) provide the user with the opportunity to opt out.

ChannelAdvisor collects aggregate analytics information related to use of the ChannelAdvisor Services by Users (such as log and configuration data). We use this information to understand how the Services are being configured and used, how they can be improved for the benefit of Users, and to develop new Services.
Other Disclosures. ChannelAdvisor may disclose a User’s personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or if ChannelAdvisor has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect and/or defend the rights and interests of ChannelAdvisor or others. ChannelAdvisor may, as permitted by applicable law, disclose your personal information to ChannelAdvisor Clients, other Users or third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity and you expressly authorize ChannelAdvisor to make such disclosures.

V. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM SHOPPERS AND CHANNELADVISOR CLIENTS
Bidding and Buying Process. If you are a Shopper, we share personal information about you with that ChannelAdvisor Client in order to assist you with the bidding and buying process as well as to assist ChannelAdvisor Clients with the selling process. ChannelAdvisor will retain your information at ChannelAdvisor to support the transaction. To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients or ChannelAdvisor’s agents have access to a Shopper’s personal information, these entities will treat this information in no less a secure manner than they treat the personal information of customers who purchase directly through the website of that ChannelAdvisor Client. If you are a Shopper, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Clients and/or websites that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. Shoppers should contact these ChannelAdvisor Clients and/or websites directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.
Customer Support. Contact information provided by a Shopper in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests and may be provided to ChannelAdvisor Clients or third parties as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request.
Marketing/Special Offers/Solicitation from ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may use a Shopper’s information to provide updates and for other business purposes related to making available the features and functions of Services. ChannelAdvisor also may use information a Shopper provides to make a Shopper aware of new products or special offers or promotions. ChannelAdvisor will abide by requests from you to discontinue such use. As a Shopper, if you receive communications directly from a ChannelAdvisor Client, you should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client directly concerning such communications and review their privacy policies. A Shopper will receive such information as described in this Section unless a Shopper has opted out of receiving such information from ChannelAdvisor as part of the checkout process. Outside of the checkout process, Shoppers may also opt out of receiving such information (if you have not already opted out of receiving it) by sending a request as described below.
Providing Your Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation (Shoppers). If you are a Shopper, ChannelAdvisor does not sell your personal information to third parties for purposes of marketing or soliciting you, provided however, we may share personal information with a third party upon your prior consent (opt­out). To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients (for example, a seller of an item you purchased) have access to your personal information as a result of your bidding or buying, where ChannelAdvisor provides your information to ChannelAdvisor Clients as part of a transaction you may be involved in with such ChannelAdvisor Client, these entities may solicit or market to you in accordance with their policies. As a Shopper, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Clients that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ChannelAdvisor Clients directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your personal information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.
Providing Your Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation (ChannelAdvisor Clients). If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client, ChannelAdvisor may provide certain of your registration information to third parties for use in marketing and in designing or providing their own services, to send you information about its products and to notify you if you win a contest. You may opt out of ChannelAdvisor providing such information to third parties at any time by updating your Personal Account Settings or by contacting ChannelAdvisor. You should contact the third party directly who may already be sending you messages in order to request that these communications stop, and to review their privacy policies.
Bidding, Buying, Selling History. ChannelAdvisor may use any information collected related to a Shopper or ChannelAdvisor Client’s bidding, buying or selling history to generate recommendations and predictions related to likelihood of your willingness to complete a bid and may submit such history and recommendations to ChannelAdvisor Clients.

You can also ask us to specify what personal information we have about you and to delete certain personal information about you from our records, or request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law). Please let us know what information you would like us to remove from our databases or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request.We will need to verify your identity before implementing your request, and you shall provide us with information that we may reasonably need to perform such verification.

We, or the relevant data controller, will respond to your requests consistent with applicable law, and we will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may need to retain certain personal information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you, our legal obligations or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, but such residual information will no longer be tied to your identity. . You should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, the seller of an item you have purchased) directly in order to access, modify or update your personal information with them.
