Personal identification information
We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when users subscribe to the newsletter, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site (such as comments and giveaways).

Each user’s IP address is logged with each visit and each action performed on the Site. This information is never provided to the third parties, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, and is logged only for a temporary period of time.

Except as noted herein, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.
