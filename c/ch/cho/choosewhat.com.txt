How We Make Money
ChooseWhat.com is a for-profit business, but rather than charging a subscription fee, we have referral agreements with many of the companies we review. In an effort to provide a complete comparison resource we review all of the relevant companies we are aware of within a products category, regardless of whether they offer a referral program, because we need our visitors to be able to see an apples to apples comparison of all the providers. We don't let the terms of our compensation agreements impact our reviews, for three primary reasons:
We typically only get paid if you actually sign up for the service.
For most referral programs, you must not cancel the service or return the product before the expiration of an initial period (typically 30 to 45 days). If we were to misrepresent a product or service, you would likely cancel or request a refund, and we'd all lose.
We need to earn your loyalty, so you'll continue to come to us for advice. If you think we've misled you, I doubt you'd return. I wouldn't.
