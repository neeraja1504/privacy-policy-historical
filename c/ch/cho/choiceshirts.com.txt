Privacy Policy
ChoiceShirts® values its customers and respects their privacy.
We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. ChoiceShirts® recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. We do not sell or rent the information you provide to us online to third parties.
We also give you the option to receive—or not receive—promotional email from us by displaying a choice during the checkout process. If you choose " Yes, I would like to know about promotions," you will receive news about our sales, new products, and special offers. If you choose " No ," you won't receive any email advertisements from us. No matter which choice you pick, we'll still send you important information about your order, such as letting you know when your order has been shipped. Each email newsletter you receive will always give you the option to opt out of receiving future email from us.
If our information practices change in the future, we will let you know by posting the policy changes on our Web site or by communicating directly with you. We will notify you of any such change before we use your information in a manner not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information.

Secure Online Ordering
Secure online ordering exactly like the big guys...
At ChoiceShirts® we don't just stand behind our merchandise. We also do our best to provide a safe and convenient online shopping experience.
Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. This the same secure ordering security used by large online retailers like Amazon.com and Expedia.com
SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it's a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our website's servers.
To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at bottom of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed our secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." Keep in mind, you’ll only see this after you click "Checkout" and have begun the checkout process.
Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at ChoiceShirts®. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-485-6601. You can also use our online email form or fax us at 630-982-2375. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
And just to make sure you feel absolutely comfortable, we safeguard the integrity of our customers' credit card information. If your credit card or debit card ("credit card") is used in an unauthorized manner on our site (as determined by your credit card company), we will cover whatever amount your credit card company doesn't – up to $50.
So if you’ve read this far and still not comfortable ordering online or would just prefer to make your purchase via telephone, just give us a call at 800-485-6601. We’d love to talk to you. Our Customer Service representatives are available Monday – Friday (excluding holidays) from 8:30am – 5:00pm Eastern time. They'll be happy to take your ChoiceShirts® order right over the phone. Or, feel free to use our online email form or send us a fax at 630-982-2375. Just make sure you include the item number, quantity, description, size, credit card information including expiration date, and shipping address.
Cookies
We give you cookies but not the chocolate chip kind...
A cookie is a small data file that Web sites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally confidential information in your cookie. That’s a fancy way of saying we don’t keep your credit card information on file.
Instead, we use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. When you visit ChoiceShirts®, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. For example, if your computer automatically turns of while you’re shopping and you need to reboot, all your items in your shopping cart will still be there when you return to our site. Your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. When you order from us, we also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our site. If you have not ordered from us, we may still monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.
We also use cookies to track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to ours to further improve our site design and to fulfill contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web sites.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, we may not be able to recognize you as a customer and therefore you may have to re-enter information that we would otherwise keep handy for you such as your billing address and the contents of your shopping cart.
