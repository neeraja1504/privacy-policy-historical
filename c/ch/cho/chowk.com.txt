Registration Details
At the time readers register at Chowk, Chowk asks for a phone number so we can make an effort to contact you in connection with publication of your submission. We do not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or otherwise disclose it to third parties.
E-mail to a friend feature
Chowk offers an e-mail a friend feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an interesting submission. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from Chowk or its partners as a result of having used this feature.
We do not sell or redistribute Chowkwala membership list and will not send you e-mail at the address you provide, except for infrequent announcements relating to Chowk or as needed to resolve issues that may arise with your Chowk account. From time to time, Chowk may also email you about relevant events such as special issues, events etc. Chowk does not reuse or resell the list of registered users.
