Privacy Statement
Privacy Statement
Web Privacy Statement
Cleveland State University is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential
information. We do not actively share personal information gathered from our Web servers. However,
because Cleveland State is a public institution, some information collected from the university website,
including information from our server logs, e-mails delivered to the university, and information collected
from Web-based forms, may be subject to the Ohio Public Records Act. This means that while we do not
actively share information, in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered
from our Web servers.
Cleveland State University also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA),
which prohibits the release of education records except in limited circumstances (i.e., with the student's
permission, to parents of dependent students, and in response to a valid court order). For more
information on FERPA at Cleveland State University, go to https://www.csuohio.edu/registrar/family-
educational-rights-and-privacy-act. Although FERPA regulations apply only to students, Cleveland State
University is equally committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our website. Cleveland State also
complies with the applicable provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Sharing of Information
Unless required by the Ohio Public Records Act, it is against university policy to release information
gathered through the Web, such as pages visited or personalized preferences.
Cleveland State University does, however, share information with other parties at the request of users
(persons to whom the information applies). For example, the university receives test scores from testing
agencies and will send transcripts to other schools at the student’s request.
Consistent with FERPA, we do not release personal student information, other than public directory
information, to other parties unless we have legal authorization to do so. Student directory information
may be released without the student's written consent. Directory information includes: name, home city
and state home address*, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, dates of attendance,
degrees and awards (honors) earned, university e-mail address.
* Disclosure of the home address is restricted to state, local or national elected officials for the purpose of
sending congratulatory letters, or to potential scholarship sponsors for the purpose of marketing
scholarship opportunities. For more information go to https://www.csuohio.edu/registrar/family-
educational-rights-and-privacy-act.
** Disclosure of the university email address is limited to users of the university email system only, and
only for purposes of locating email addresses in the email directory.
Privacy and Public Records Requests
Cleveland State complies with all laws that prohibit the release of information. This includes student
education records protected by FERPA, financial information, including credit card information protected
by GLBA, and personal health information protected by HIPAA.

Ohio Public Records Act.
If You Send Us Personal Information
Cleveland State's website will only collect personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide
by, for example, sending emails, completing membership forms, registering for classes or other programs,
responding to surveys, or ordering merchandise. If you provide us with personal information, we will
normally respond to your inquiry, request, or order; we may also contact you to provide information about
college activities, programs, membership and development opportunities, and special events that may
interest you. It is university policy that confidential information you enter is used only for the purposes
described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.
Cleveland State University will only share information about you to other parties when one or more of the
following conditions apply:
   We have your consent to share the information.
   We need to share your information to provide the service or product you requested.
   We need to send your information to companies who work on behalf of Cleveland State
University to provide a service or product to you.

Encryption
Cleveland State uses encryption to prevent third parties from accessing sensitive data, such as
passwords, e-commerce information, etc. You are normally required to enter a Cleveland State CSUID
and password when you request data about yourself or to ensure that you are a member of the university
community. For example, students who want to check their grades or staff members who complete time
sheets must enter their Cleveland State CSUID and password so the system knows who is requesting the
data. This login process uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) so the user name and
password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.
Several sites within Cleveland State University enable you to pay for products or services online with a
credit card. These transactions are encrypted. Questions about security concerns involving credit card
transactions may be directed to security@csuohio.edu.
