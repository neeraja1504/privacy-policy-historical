From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-personally identifiable information, that is, data that is not intended to allow us to identify you personally, such as your first name, birthday or postal code.

IV. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION
A. Third Party Links
We are not responsible for the practices employed by web sites linked to or from our Site or Services, nor for the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link or go from our Site to another web site, including those sites that have a link on our Site, you are subject to that other web site’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding to interact with such other website.
B. Data Security
We maintain a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards designed to protect your Personal Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, we use industry accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems.
You should be aware, however, that CSGOShop has no control over the security of other web sites on the Internet that you might visit, even where such other site is linked to our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your information.
We want you to feel confident using the Site. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your information, searches or other communications always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your information.

You must be 13 years and older to use the Site. As a result, CSGOShop does not intentionally collect information about children under the age of 13. If we learn that CSGOShop has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We require that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive a parent’s or guardian’s permission before using CSGOShop or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet. If you are under the age of 18, you warrant that you have the express permission of your parent or legal guardian to use the Site and to give information about yourself to the Site. If you are a parent or legal guardian and have authorised a minor to use the Site and Services, you agree that you are responsible for the online conduct of the minor, and for the consequences of any misuse of the Site and/or Services by the minor.
