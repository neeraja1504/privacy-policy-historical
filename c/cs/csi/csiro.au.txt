However, on occasions, we may need to collect personal information from other sources such as public records, parents or guardians of children under the age of 18 years and third parties. When dealing with children, we seek parental consent prior to the collection of personal information, including photographs.
We may collect personal information in various ways, including via:
Online forms (such as subscription forms or registration forms for an event);

For what purposes does CSIRO collect, hold and use personal information?
With CSIRO’s extensive and diverse activities, we collect, hold and use personal information throughout CSIRO for many different purposes and via different methods. We only collect personal information for purposes directly related to our functions or activities under the SIR Act and only where it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes.
When we collect personal information from you for certain specific activities, where required, we will use a collection notice that deals specifically with that collection, including a description of the purposes for which we will use the personal information collected in that instance. Where relevant, our internal procedures and systems embed privacy protections to ensure we comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act.
We may use or hold personal information for the following general purposes:
to provide scientific and research **** services to both public and private sector clients;
to manage our employees and contractors, including to consider prospective employees;
to undertake research and testing as part of our functions under the SIR Act (such as information about individuals participating in focus group testing, including health information for food testing and information about physical reactions to food additives);
to maintain membership or subscriber records for our publications or club members (such as the Double Helix Club); and
to promote and market our activities.
From time to time, we may need to disclose personal information to our joint venture partners or share information with contractors or agents who provide services to us, such as off-site file storage facilities and financial institutions which transmit payments on our behalf.
We will collect personal information from you for the purposes described in a collection notice and will only use or disclose your personal information for other purposes if:
you have consented to the other use;
you would reasonably expect, or have been told, that your personal information is usually passed on to other entities;
it is required or authorised by law;
it will prevent or lessen a serious threat to someone’s life, health or safety (including public health and safety);

Should you decide to complete and submit an online form on any part of the CSIRO website, we:

Research activities
We may conduct research involving human participants and this research may involve the collection of personal information, including health information, genetic information, or information about a person as part of social research. The collection of such information may also have ethical approval requirements.
When dealing with personal information in a research context, we will usually de-identify that information. If personal information is not de-identified, we will deal with personal information collected in the course of research in accordance with the Privacy Act.
We may also deal with personal information of research partners or clients when providing scientific research services and testing services to both public and private sector clients. This may include the following sorts of personal information:
Name, address, occupation and residential email and telephone contact details;
Opinions and reactions to testing and research; or

We store the contact details of a wide range of clients and stakeholders, ranging from direct subscribers to periodical publications, to business, research and community contacts. This information may be used to disseminate information and to facilitate participation in events and CSIRO activities. In managing this information, we will:
hold all personal information in secure databases, both at onsite and offsite locations.
ensure that at any time, a recipient of e-mailed mass communication may ask to “unsubscribe” from our central marketing/communication database.

general management of employment;
performance management (misconduct, grievance, probation);
financial, legal, security, information technology and communications matters related to a staff member’s employment.

Freedom of Information requests
We collect personal information when administering an individual’s request for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1984 __ (Cth).
CSIRO as a contracted service provider to other Commonwealth agencies
We may, from time to time, engage service providers to provide services to us. Where those services involve a service provider dealing with personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that our contract with the service provider obliges the service provider to comply with the same level privacy obligations as CSIRO.
How does CSIRO store personal information?
Each area of CSIRO that collects personal information stores that information securely on CSIRO’s IT systems. These systems are password protected and where required, only certain people are authorised to access the information. We also have recordkeeping obligations under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) , and have record keeping codes specific to particular areas of CSIRO activity. We are also required to comply with other government policies in relation to storage and security of information, including the Australian Government Policy and Risk Management Guidelines for the storage and processing of Australian Government information in outsourced or offshore ICT arrangements and the Protective Security Policy Framework , complemented by the Australian Government Information Security Manual.
We may use third parties to store some personal information on servers in Australia or overseas, but only where steps have been taken to ensure that the third parties comply with our privacy obligations.
Disclosures of personal information overseas
We may disclose personal information overseas from time to time, for example in the course of a research project with an overseas entity, through publishing information or by storing information on a server located overseas. Where we may be transferring personal information overseas, we will either inform you and seek your consent to the arrangement or ensure that appropriate contractual measures are in place to ensure that the overseas entity protects the personal information to the same level as required of CSIRO under the Privacy Act.
Access to and amendment of personal information held by CSIRO
We will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold, subject to any applicable exceptions under the Privacy Act. We will require you to verify your identity and specify, as clearly as possible, the information that you wish to access. We will not charge you for lodging a request for access to your own personal information but may charge for reasonable administrative costs. The fee will be determined on a case by case basis and you will be informed beforehand of the likely cost.
CSIRO employees seeking their employment details should initially do so in accordance with CSIRO’s human resources processes. CSIRO is also subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1984 (Cth) and this operates alongside your right to access your personal information under the Privacy ACT.
If you can establish that information held by us about you is inaccurate, irrelevant, out of date, incomplete or misleading, we will take reasonable steps to amend it. If we disagree with your view about the status of this information, we will provide reasons for the refusal and record a statement in our records of your view.
Complaints
If you have a privacy related complaint about us, please contact CSIRO’s Privacy Officer on (02) 6276 6123 or FOI@csiro.au.
