3. Collection of Personal Information
Non-Members: When you browse the Website, you do so anonymously. The Operator does not collect Personal Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us when registering with the Website in order to access Members-only portions of the Website, submitting an inquiry to us, or for any other purposes that are identified when or before the time the Personal Information is collected.
Members: Where you interact with the Website to access those sections of the Website that are restricted to Members, we may ask you to register and/or sign in and we will collect certain Personal Information from you if you do so. The Personal Information that we may collect for this purpose may include your name, title, company, business address and phone number, and email address, and any other Personal Information that you choose to provide to us. The Operator collects this information for the purpose of enabling Members’ access to these restricted areas. Access is granted by submitting certain Personal Information for authentication.
Inquiries: You may submit an inquiry to us through the “Contact” link of the Website (ceo.ca/contact/). We may ask for certain Personal Information such as your name, e-mail address, and so on. We collect this information in order to enable us to respond to your inquiries in as thorough a manner as possible.
Server logs: Our servers automatically log information about visits to the Website in the normal course of establishing and maintaining web connections. The server logs record statistical information, such as visitors’ IP addresses, time and duration of visit, and websites visited. We collect this information so that we may continuously improve our Content. These statistics are reported in aggregate form only. We may process and use this aggregate data for various purposes, including, but not limited to, analysis of this data for trends and statistics, development of the Website and the Website’s features and offerings, assessing patterns of use, or planning and evaluating marketing initiatives. We do not link server log information to any other data in a way that would enable us to identify individual visitors.
Cookies: Cookies are small text files that contain a unique identifier that is placed on your computer. When you visit the Website, the Website saves the file with a matching identifier. When you revisit the Website days or weeks later, depending on the settings of your Internet browser, the Website may be able to recognize you by matching the cookie on your computer with the matching identifier in its database. Many Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you reject cookies, you may be limited in using some areas of the Website.
4. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
We do not use or disclose Personal Information for any purposes other than those identified in this Privacy Policy, except with your consent or as required by law. We do not sell, lease, or trade information about you to other parties. Personal Information is retained only as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
We may share (provide and receive) aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include demographic data such as the gender and/or geographic location of groups of Members and non-Members, but it will not include personal information (such as your name or email address). We may use aggregate demographic information about visitors to the Website in order to improve the services offered on the Website, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. Where Personal Information is disclosed to Third Parties for the fulfillment of purposes described in this Privacy Policy, such Third Parties receiving the disclosed Personal Information will be contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality and security of the Personal Information and will be restricted from using such information in any way not expressly authorized by the Operator.
5. Consent
By submitting Personal Information to the Operator, you agree that the Operator may collect your Personal Information and you consent to the use, disclosure, and transfer of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted or required by law. In addition, you represent and warrant that you have the right and authority or have obtained all necessary consents to provide any information, including any Personal Information of another individual that is provided by you to the Operator.
You may refuse or withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. You may refuse or withdraw your consent by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address listed below. Our Privacy Officer will explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing consent, and will record your choices.
6. Accuracy
The Operator will make reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, and current as required for the purposes for which it was collected. If you find any inaccuracies in our information, you can contact the Privacy Officer and we will make the appropriate corrections promptly.
7. Safeguards
The Operator will use appropriate security safeguards to protect your Personal Information from risks such as unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal or similar risks. Safeguards include physical, administrative, and electronic security measures. Nevertheless, Internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any messages or information you send to the Website may be read or intercepted by others, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us.
When we are required by law to provide information, we take reasonable steps to verify the lawful authority for the collection and we will disclose only the information that is legally required.
8. Access
You have the right to access your Personal Information under the control of the Operator. Upon request in writing to the Privacy Officer at the address listed below, you will be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information and you will be given access to that information. In certain exceptional situations, the Operator may not be able to provide access to certain Personal Information that it holds about you. For example, the Operator may not provide access to Personal Information if doing so would reveal Personal Information about another individual. If access cannot be provided, the Operator will notify you, in writing, of the reasons for the refusal and you may contact the Privacy Officer with respect to your questions about the refusal.
9. Children
The Website is not directed to children under 18 years of age without appropriate parental notice and consent. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from people under 18 years of age. If you are under 18, please do not send any information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as reasonably possible.
