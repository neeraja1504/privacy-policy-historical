Ceeok - Download Libary! TERMS
Federal law requires that I notify you of my privacy policy. My clients expect their confidential information to be treated with the utmost discretion. I take this responsibility seriously. All information given to me in confidence remains confidential.
Customer information: The information you provide is needed so that I can make appropriate insurance and other recommendations. Some of this information is known as nonpublic personal information. I have no need to seek or collect nonpublic personal information from third party sources, since my clients provide this information directly. I strive to maintain accurate, up-to-date records in order to serve my clients. Any inaccuracies that are called to my attention are corrected promptly.
Sharing information: I do not share nonpublic personal information with any outside persons or organizations. However, I cannot rule out the possibility that, at some future date we may need to contract with a third party source of administrative or technical support. In such case, I will require the third party to agree to safeguard such nonpublic information and to use it only for the agreed purpose. I do not sell, rent, or loan my client list to any third party. I do not give prospective clients the names of existing clients unless the client has authorized me to do so.
Access to and protection of information: Only those governmental agencies with a valid reason for doing so have access to my files containing nonpublic personal information. I maintain security standards to protect nonpublic personal information.
Disclosure of privacy policy: I provide this privacy notice for informational purposes and I will update it as required by law. If you have any comments, suggestions or questions about my privacy policy, please let me know.
