Account Data and Content Privacy
Company takes the security of User's Data, Content, and other personal information seriously and wants Users to feel comfortable using the Website.

Company's systems are also compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Company has installed layered firewalls and other security technologies to help prevent unauthorized access to its systems. Strong password protection protocols are used on all computers and employees are kept up-to-date on Company's security and privacy policies.

Company also limits access to personally identifiable information to those employees and contractors who need access in order to carry out their job responsibilities and to certain Educational Institutions (as defined below) or other persons, entities, or organizations designated by User. Such protective measures are designed to limit access to User's Content, Data, and other personal information.
