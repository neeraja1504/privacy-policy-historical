To facilitate future interactions with the site or application
To help us create content that is most relevant to you
To alert you to product upgrades, special offers or promotions, and information updates and services from Certiport and its partners
To provide feedback to the various companies or organizations that sponsor the certification you may be pursuing
We occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including shipping, online shopping services, survey management, etc. We provide those companies only with the information they need to deliver that service. They are prohibited from using that information for other purposes.

These elections will remain in place and be honored by Certiport until you should chose to modify them by updating your preferences in the same application.
Certiport occasionally allows other companies to offer our customers information about their products and services. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you may so indicate in the opt-out application.
