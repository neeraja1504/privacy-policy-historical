You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY
LSDroid uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information that LSDroid receives on your behalf to operate the LSDroid Services or that you transmit to LSDroid and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, ethical, or managerial safeguards.
If LSDroid learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. LSDroid may post a notice on the LSDroid Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
IN THE EVENT OF MERGER, SALE, OR BANKRUPTCY
In the event that LSDroid is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control so that the LSDroid Service can continue operations. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we will do everything in our power to protect how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. You will be notified via notice through the LSDroid Services of any such change in ownership or control of your personally identifiable information.

Your continued use of the LSDroid Services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions. If we decide to change our privacy policies, then we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
