Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site  transfers to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. We use cookies to  analyze traffic patterns on our site.
A web beacon is a transparent, 1-pixel image in .gif format that helps us  collect data about visitors viewing a web page -- for example, to count the  number of visitors to a page or to deliver a cookie to visitors' browsers when  they view that page. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for  these and other purposes.
Cookies and web beacons cannot give us access to your computer or to  information beyond what you provide to us. Disabling cookies in your browser  will prevent us from using cookies or web beacons to collect data about your  visit to our site, but you will still be able to view the publicly available  information on our web site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.  Consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on  restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you are using a  shared computer and you have cookies turned on, be sure to log off when you finish.
