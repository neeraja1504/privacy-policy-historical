Dealertrack: Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
January 1, 2016
This Privacy Notice explains our data collection and privacy practices for users of the public pages of our website, us.dealertrack.com. If you do not agree to these practices, please do not continue to use this site. Your continued use of this site constitutes your agreement to the following terms. This Privacy Notice applies only to those pages of our site that are available to the general public. It does not apply to pages that require a subscription or password for access. As used in this notice, "site" means our public website and all of its pages.
We collect information about users of our site. This user information consists of your activity navigating through our site, your use of demonstration materials or interactive pages, and similar information. We also collect any information you provide to us—including non-public personal information such as name, employer, address, email address or other information—when you use this site, such as when you request information about our products or services. We reserve the right to share this data with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties for any purposes to the extent permitted by applicable law. If you do not want us to collect and use information, please do not provide it to us.
We collect anonymous traffic data on our site through the use of cookies, a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. When you visit our site, we set one or more cookies in your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, tracking site visits, and providing information to you while on our site. The Help feature on most Internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you set your browser to decline cookies, you may not be able to get the benefit of the features of this website or other websites that you visit.
Our servers may automatically record information that your Internet browser sends whenever you visit our site. These server logs may include information such as your Web request; the Internet Protocol (IP) address you use to connect your computer to the Internet; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time of your visit; browser type; and browser language.
We also use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These third party companies employ cookies and web beacon (also referred to as retargeting pixels, 1x1gifs, or action tags) technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. Web beacons may be used to deliver the cookie and compile statistics about our website, such as how many people visited a particular page or clicked on certain links. While your particular use of the site will not be revealed and no personally identifying information is collected through cookies or web beacons, this anonymous information may be used for online preference marketing purposes and our third party advertising companies may use the information about your visit to our website in order to provide ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you. This information may include the date/time of the banner ad shown, related cookie, and the first three octets of the IP address. We may also share aggregated statistics about the use of our website with third parties.
Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to a DNT signal, we do not currently respond to DNT signals on this website or on websites where we provide advertisements, content, or other services.
If you apply online for a job at Dealertrack or create an online profile for employment purposes, the personal information you provide will be used to process your application and communicate with you regarding the status of the position or, in our discretion, for other potential positions. We may share the information you provide with third party service providers that perform services on our behalf in connection with filling open positions. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose such information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with applicable law. We also may transfer your information to an entity to which we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. In addition, we may disclose information about you if we are required to do so by applicable law or legal process or as may be requested by law enforcement or regulatory authorities. By creating an online profile for employment purposes, you represent that the information you submit is true, complete, and accurate in all respects. If you would like to update or delete your profile, you may do so at any time by logging into your account.
When you access our website on your mobile device, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. Most likely, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. See your mobile device guide for additional details.
Our site may present links to other websites in a format that enables us to keep track of whether and how often these links have been followed. Once you leave our site by linking to another site, we assume no responsibility for the information collection or privacy practices of that site and you should read their privacy notice before providing any information.
We may periodically change the terms of this Privacy Notice. When we do so, we will post the revised date at the top of the page in the same manner as the date appears here. You should check here for changes in our practices when you visit our site.
If you have questions about our data collection, sharing, and privacy practices, please send us an email at privacy@dealertrack.com.
