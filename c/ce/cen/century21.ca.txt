CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP PRIVACY POLICY
CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
PRIVACY POLICY
Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership (“CENTURY 21”) recognizes the importance of
protecting the personal information of our Customers, our prospective customers, brokers and
sales people with our franchisees and anyone else from whom we may collect personal
information from time to time whether in the course of real estate transactions or otherwise.
This Privacy Policy discloses the type of personal information we gather from or about you
(“You”), how we may use it, how and to whom we may disclose it, your right to access your
personal information which we have collected and your right to correct or change that
information where You believe it may be inaccurate. At CENTURY 21 we hope to give You as
much control about your personal information as possible.
CENTURY 21 and its Franchisees
As a franchisor, CENTURY 21 does not provide real estate broker services. Real estate broker
services are provided exclusively by CENTURY 21 franchisees (“Franchisees”). Each
Franchisee is an independently owned and operated real estate broker business. While
CENTURY 21 has undertaken extensive measures to control and ensure the privacy and security
of personal information collected by it, it does not own or control the operations of its
Franchisees. Customers and prospective customers who have concerns about the treatment of
their personal information by a Franchisee with which they are dealing are urged to contact that
Franchisee directly. This Privacy Policy addresses personal information that CENTURY 21 has
in its possession or control
What We Mean By Personal Information?
Personal information is any information in whatever form about an identifiable individual.
However, it does not include:
1.        your name or information which would enable us to contact You at your place of
employment including your name, position name or title, business telephone number,
business address, business email and business fax number;
2.        personal information about You that is publicly available information such as information
available from a public registry or contained in a telephone book;
3.        aggregated information that cannot be associated with You as a specific individual; and
4.        information which is not about a person but which is about a company, association or
another organization.
What Personal Information Does CENTURY 21 Collect?
CENTURY 21 collects the following personal information:
1.        personal information which You voluntarily provide to us when You visit a CENTURY
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
2
21 office (a Franchisee’s office) or that is otherwise provided directly to CENTURY 21,
such as by telephone, email, mail or fax;
photographic images of your property, descriptions of the property and its sale price for
marketing purposes, but only where we have obtained your prior consent; and
personal information which You voluntarily provide to us when You visit our website
(the “Website”), such as when You open an account or subscription or complete a
contact request, and personal information relating to your use of the Website (in
accordance with our more detailed Website Privacy Policy set out below).
Except where permitted by law, CENTURY 21 collects, uses and discloses your personal
information with your knowledge and consent and we will do so fairly and openly.
How We Use Your Personal Information
CENTURY 21 uses personal information for the following purposes:
to put You in touch with a broker or sales person with one of our Franchisees who
may contact You to assist You with listing property for sale or purchasing property;
to assist the broker or sales person in finding appropriate property for You;
unless You choose to opt-out, CENTURY 21 may use information about your home in
marketing material (we will not use your name), and may use your contact information to
promote and market additional services, products and special offers from CENTURY 21;
and
for the purposes relating to use of personal information collected on the Website set out
below in our Website Privacy Policy.
Why We Disclose Your Personal Information
CENTURY 21 may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in
providing services or products to You or to carry out one or more of the purposes
described above.         These service providers are prohibited from using personal
information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to
protect personal information disclosed to them by us and to comply with the general
privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. Note that CENTURY 21 retains a
U.S. located service provider (including, for example, WhereToLive.com, Inc.) for
certain services and the personal information provided to that U.S. based provider is
subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates.
CENTURY 21 discloses personal information when it makes the personal information a
person has provided online available to its Franchisees and their brokers and sales people.
CENTURY 21 may disclose personal information gathered on the Website for the
purposes set out below in our Website Privacy Policy.
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3                                           3
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to collect, use and disclose other personal information without
your knowledge or consent if we are required to do so or if we are allowed to by law.
Consent
Except where required or permitted to do so without your consent, CENTURY 21 only collects
your personal information with your consent. In most cases, CENTURY 21 relies on express
consent. However, where the purpose of the collection of personal information is obvious on its
face, CENTURY 21 may rely on your implied or deemed consent.
In some cases, such as using your personal information for marketing services to You,
CENTURY 21 will rely on opt-out consent. (You will receive the information unless You advise
us You do not wish to receive it.)
CENTURY 21 only collects personal information where it is reasonably necessary to provide the
service which You are seeking and which we have agreed to provide. We do not use deceptive
or misleading practices to obtain your consent.
CENTURY 21 does not require You to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal
information as a condition of the supply of a service by us unless such collection, use or
disclosure is required to fulfill the aforementioned purposes of collection.
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to collect, use or disclose personal information in certain
limited circumstances, without your knowledge and consent, where required or permitted by law.
You may withdraw your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in
connection with the services that You have requested from us at any time, subject to legal or
contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. CENTURY 21 will inform You of the
implications of withdrawing your consent. If You wish to withdraw your consent at any time,
please contact CENTURY 21’s Privacy Officer (see below for contact information).
Access To Your Personal Information
You have the right to access your personal information in the possession or control of
CENTURY 21 and to know how that personal information has been and is being used, and to
whom it has been disclosed. CENTURY 21 reserves the right to refuse to comply with all or
part of a request where we are required to or are permitted to refuse to do so by the provisions of
applicable personal information protection legislation.
Applications must be in writing and be sent to our Privacy Officer either by mail or email at the
addresses set out below. Applications should have sufficient detail that allows us to identify You
and the personal information You are requesting.
You may ask to have errors or omissions in your personal information in our possession or
control corrected. If we are satisfied that the correction is reasonably necessary, we will correct
the personal information and notify anyone to whom we have provided the personal information
in the previous 12 months of the correction. If we are not satisfied that the correction should be
made, we will annotate the personal information under our control of the correction requested
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
4
but not made.
Requests for access and correction will usually be responded to within 30 calendar days of
receiving the request unless we apply to the applicable Privacy Commissioner for an extension.
We charge $25 plus $.25 per page for providing You with copies of your personal
information. In the event that it will take an unusually long time to collect your personal
information, we may charge an additional amount. In each case, we will give You a full quote
before photocopying the personal information. There is no charge for correcting personal
information.
We will assist You with your request and will respond as accurately and completely as
reasonably possible. Where we refuse all or part of your request, we will give You the
reasons for the refusal and the applicable legislation on which we base our refusal; the name and
contact information of someone within CENTURY 21 who can explain the basis for the refusal
and of your right to apply to a Privacy Commissioner for review.
How We Protect Personal Information
CENTURY 21 makes reasonable efforts to ensure that Your personal information is protected
against loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modifying, disposal or
similar risks. This protection applies in relation to personal information stored in both electronic
and hard copy form and will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information.
Access to non-public personal information is restricted to selected employees or representatives
on a need-to-know basis. In addition, CENTURY 21 employs generally accepted information
security techniques, such as firewalls and access control procedures in order to protect personal
information against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modifying,
disposal or similar risk.
Retention of Personal Information
CENTURY 21 retains personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for
which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. Personal information which is
collected and used to make a decision about You is retained for at least one year. Your consent to
such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of CENTURY 21’s relationship with You.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. The
Privacy Policy distributed at any time or from-time-to time posted on the Website shall be
deemed to be the Privacy Policy then in effect.
Accountability
CENTURY 21 is responsible for the personal information under its control, and we have
designated a Privacy Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this Privacy Policy and
with applicable laws. Other individuals within CENTURY 21 may be delegated to act on behalf
of the Privacy Officer and CENTURY 21 will use appropriate means to provide a comparable
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3

level of protection while information is being processed by a third party.

Dispute Resolution
If You are unhappy about the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by
CENTURY 21, we ask that You discuss the matter further with our Privacy Officer.
If You are not satisfied with the response, You may make an application or complaint to the
appropriate Privacy Commissioner.
Note to Brokers and Sales People
In order to promote the services of our Franchisees and their brokers and sales people,
CENTURY 21 collects certain personal information about them, such as photographs and
contact information, in a variety of ways, including through OnlineOffice registration. This
information is disclosed by CENTURY 21 when it makes the information available for
Customers to access on the Website or through other means by which CENTURY 21 promotes
their services.
Much of this information is business contact information, which is not subject to privacy law or
this Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that such information is personal in nature,
CENTURY 21 will collect, use and disclosure this information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy (see above) and, where applicable, with our Website Privacy Policy.
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
The following addresses the personal information Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership
(“CENTURY 21”) may collect about You during any interaction with our website (the
“Website”).
Your Acceptance of this Website Privacy Policy
By using the Website, You signify your agreement with and acceptance of CENTURY 21’s
Website Privacy Policy. If You do not accept this Website Privacy Policy, You must not access
or use the Website.
CENTURY 21 may, at any time, without notice or liability, revise this Website Privacy Policy
by updating this posting. You should periodically revisit this posting to review any revisions to
this Website Privacy Policy. If any revision is not acceptable to You, You must cease accessing
and using the Website. If You continue to access or use the Website after any revisions are
posted You will be deemed to have accepted those revisions.
Types of Personal Information
We receive two types of personal information from Customers who visit the Website: (1)
personal information that Customers provide through registration or other communication on the
Website; and (2) personal information CENTURY 21 gathers through aggregated tracking
procedures, such as tallying the number of page views throughout the Website over a given
period of time. The second type of personal information enables us to tailor the Website content
to better meet the needs of our Customers. However, we assure You that CENTURY 21 will not
disclose your personal information to third parties except as permitted by applicable law.
CENTURY 21 and its Franchisees
As a franchisor, CENTURY 21 does not provide real estate broker services. Real estate broker
services are provided exclusively by CENTURY 21 franchisees (“Franchisees”). Each
Franchisee is an independently owned and operated real estate broker business. Customers
applying for services through the Website apply through a Franchisee, not through CENTURY
21. While CENTURY 21 has undertaken extensive measures to control and ensure the privacy
and security of personal information obtained through the Website, it does not own or control the
operations of its Franchisees. Customers and prospective customers who have concerns about the
treatment of their personal information by a Franchisee with which they are dealing are urged to
contact that Franchisee directly.
How Does CENTURY 21 Collect Personal Information?
(a)       Registration: CENTURY 21 does not collect your personal information through the
Website except when such personal information is provided to us on a voluntary basis.
For example, CENTURY 21 will collect a user’s name, address, phone number and/or e-
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
2
mail address and any additional details that a user chooses to provide if he or she
completes the portion of the Website that requests that CENTURY 21 or one of the
Franchisees contacts the user or the user registers for an account or subscription on the
Website. If you choose not to provide your personal information, please note that certain
services associated with the Website may not be available to You as they cannot be
supplied without your personal information. The personal information gathered through
the Website is governed by the foregoing Privacy Policy.
(b)       Usage tracking:
(i)      Use of IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to
your computer whenever You are surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically
identify your computer by its IP address.
CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system
administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit
the use of the Website. When Customers request pages from the Website, our
servers log the requesting Customers’ IP addresses. Except where You participate
in any online transaction CENTURY 21 may offer from time to time, we
normally will not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which
means that Customers’ sessions will be logged, but Customer identity remains
anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when
we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or
to protect our service, the Website, or any person, or where it is otherwise
permitted by law.
(ii)     Use Of Cookies: Cookies are bits of information that a website transfers to
an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web
surfing easier for You by saving your preferences while You visit the Website.
We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of
cookies is an industry standard, and, as such, You’ll encounter them at most
major websites.
By showing how and when Customers use the Website, cookies help us see which
areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the
Website are based on data collected using cookies, such as the total number of
visitors and pages viewed in a given period of time. This kind of information is
most easily tracked using cookies.
CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates and Franchisees have two primary uses for
its cookies. First, we use them to specify preferences. For example, Customers
can specify keywords across several categories or markets so You do not have to
tell us over and over again about the kinds of homes You are interested in
obtaining information about. Secondly, we use cookies to track Customer trends
and patterns. This helps us to better understand our Customers’ needs and to
improve areas of CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates’ services that our Customers
may find valuable. Sometimes, information from cookies is attached to
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
3
messages sent to our Customer Service department.                 While all of these
situations depend on the use of a cookie, You always have the option of disabling
the receipt of cookies on your computer by adjusting the cookies setting in your
Web browser preferences.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your Web
browser to either refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, with a
concurrent option to accept or receive the cookie. However, note that some of the
services offered on the Website will not function properly or may be considerably
slower if You refuse to receive cookies. For example, without cookies, You will
not be able to set personalized preferences. You might also encounter difficulties
participating in online transactions offered on the Website from time to time.
Occasionally, You may receive cookies from our advertisers. CENTURY 21
and/or its affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies
sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
(iii)    Other: CENTURY 21 automatically collects anonymous statistical information
regarding usage of the Website. For instance, the Website will recognize the type
of browser you are using (Netscape, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.), the address of
the Internet Service Provider You are using, the site that linked You to the
Website, the pages You visit at the Website and similar information. None of this
information identifies You personally.
With Whom Does CENTURY 21 Share Your Personal Information?
As a general rule, CENTURY 21 will not disclose any of your personal information except when
we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith
that the law requires it or under other specified circumstances, including those described below:
(a)       Business Partners & Sponsors: CENTURY 21 may disclose some or all your personal
information to business partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically described to
You prior to either the collection or transfer of the personal information.             Many
promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By
requesting more information, You give CENTURY 21 permission to transfer your
personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances,
only your e-mail address will be shared with the sponsor. If we intend on sharing more
personal information with the sponsor than your e-mail, You will be notified prior to the
transfer.
(b)       Third Party Data and Data in the Aggregate: From time to time, on the Website You may
be offered the opportunity to receive material or special offers from third parties. If You
opt to receive information from these third parties, CENTURY 21 will (with your
permission) share your name and e-mail address with such third parties.                Under
confidentiality agreements, CENTURY 21 may match Customer information with third
party data. Also, CENTURY 21 may disclose aggregated Customer statistics (i.e., where
we disclose a characteristic of our Customers as a group and not as individuals) in order
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
4
to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and
for other lawful purposes.
(c)       Service Providers: Information CENTURY 21 receives through the Website is provided
to services providers retained by CENTURY 21 including Filogix Inc. and
WheretoLive.com, Inc., in order to organize and distribute appropriate personal
information to enable CENTURY 21 and its Franchisees to communicate with its
Customers and to provide information about marketing initiatives that may be of interest
to its Customers.
(d)       Other: CENTURY 21 may disclose account information in special cases when we have
reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring
legal action against someone who may be violating CENTURY 21’s Terms of Use or
may be causing (either intentionally or unintentionally) injury to or interference with
CENTURY 21’s rights or property, other CENTURY 21 Customers, or anyone else that
could be harmed by such activities. CENTURY 21 may disclose or access account
information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative
and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our
products and services. Note that to the extent that CENTURY 21 retains a U.S. located
service provider (including, for example, WhereToLive.com, Inc.), the personal
information in that service provider’s control or possession is subject to the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it operates.
How Can You Control the Use of Your Personal Information?
In case You change your mind or some personal information changes (such as your zip code or
e-mail address), we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal
information You give us. Additionally, to keep You in control of the communications directed
to You, we offer Customers the opportunity to “opt out” of having personal information shared
with parties outside of CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliated companies. If You wish, for
any reason, to update your personal information or if You object to any use of your personal
information described in this Website Privacy Policy, You may contact CENTURY 21’s Privacy
Officer:

What happens when You link to a Third Party Website?
You should be aware that when You are on the Website You could be directed to other third
party websites that are beyond our control. There may, from time to time, be links to other third
party websites from the Website that take You outside our service areas. For example, if You
19506.79765.MEP.9136469.3
5
“click” on a banner advertisement on the Website, the “click” typically takes You off the
Website. These other sites may include websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may
use CENTURY 21’s and/or its affiliates’ and/or its Franchisees’ logos as part of a co-branding
agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to Customers, or otherwise collect
data or solicit information.
CENTURY 21 and its affiliates and Franchisees do not control such third party websites, and,
therefore, are not responsible for their content.        CENTURY 21’s and/or its affiliates’
provision of hyperlinks to these websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on
such websites or any association with their operators. This Website Privacy Policy does not
extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and which is beyond the
control of CENTURY 21, its affiliates or its Franchisees.
Please keep in mind that whenever You give out personal information online (for example, via
message boards or chat lines), that personal information can be collected and used by people You
do not know. While CENTURY 21, its affiliates and its Franchisees strive to protect their
Customers’ personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal
information You disclose online and so You disclose such information at your own risk.
Is your Personal Information Secure from Others using the CENTURY 21 Website?
The importance of securing your personal information is of the utmost concern to us. We
exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to
our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, CENTURY 21 and its
affiliates cannot promise or warrant the security of any personal information You transmit to us,
including through the use of our online products or services. Any such transmission is done so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, CENTURY 21 uses industry standard efforts
to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls and
Secure Socket Layers. However, ironclad security does not yet exist on the Internet.
