Our Legal Grounds for collecting information
---|---|---|---
Other sources
|
Lifestyle data from companies like Experian.
|
We supplement the information we hold about you with data from other third-party sources such as Experian, to standardise, cleanse and correct the information we hold about you. This helps us keep our records cleansed , up to date and of the highest quality.
We also use third party data for example the Experian ConsumerView database, to enrich our data by looking at consumer demographics, consumption patterns and attitudes.  This allows us to continue to improve our products and services.
|
The legitimate interests of Center Parcs to ensure the data quality.
This use is not detrimental to you as we only send relevant marketing materials to you, based on the information we know about you. Whether or not you receive the marketing information does not affect your ability to book a break or activity with us.
You have the right to withdraw your consent to receive marketing communications at any time.
Where Center Parcs' legal ground for processing is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to Center Parcs' use of this information. If you want to object, contact us at  data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk, or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate, _ _ or by phone on 0344 8267723.
Marketing activities
So that you are the first to hear about our exciting new offers, activities and facilities, we may provide you with information through online digital services (e.g. online advertising, social media communications), or by direct marketing (e.g. phone, e-mail, text, post), unless you have asked us not to do so.
When you book your break or spa break you have the option to opt out of our marketing communications. This is because, when we collect your contact details during the sale of a service, a law known as the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (and in Ireland, the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011) gives us the right to contact you for marketing purposes provided that we inform you that we intend to contact you and give you the opportunity to tell us that you would prefer not to hear from us. We want to make sure that we only contact people who do want to hear from us so you can opt-out at any time either during the booking journey, through every email we send you, by logging into your account and changing your preferences or, right now, by calling our Contact Centre on 03448 8267723.
Otherwise, we will only contact you for marketing purposes if you give us your consent to do so. You can change your mind at any time by following any of the options described above.
Please note that if you have a forthcoming booking we will send you service emails related to your break or spa break even when you have unsubscribed from marketing communications, as this is information you will require for your break or spa break.
We also use your personal information to tailor the marketing communications we send to you, or the things you see when you log into the account facility.
We do not provide your personal information to external organisations (i.e. outside of Center Parcs) for their own marketing purposes.
Building profiles and targeting communications
When you interact with Center Parcs we collect information relating to your booking history with us for example the type of accommodation you choose and the activities you and the members of your party do. We use this information to build a profile or picture of the things you like and dislike, so that when we communicate with you we can send you personalised, relevant and timely communications, about things that may interest you.
We do this for two reasons. Firstly so that we can better understand our guests which helps us to improve your Center Parcs experience.  For example if you only come on breaks as a group of adults, we will not send you communications relating to activities for children.
The second reason we use profiling techniques is to better understand what our guests like doing. We want to understand what restaurants and activities you use so we can improve the guest experience.  For instance , if we find that only a small number of guests staying in lodges in the outer areas visit the Parc Market, this might indicate to us that our guests would benefit from the provision of another less central Parc Market.  Please be aware that, when we collect information about your activities, bookings and purchases on site, we will only link it to the lodge that you are staying in. This means that it is not linked to you directly but allows us to get an idea of what people booking the lodges of the kind you stayed in are likely to be interested in or missing out on during their visit. For example , if your group has booked numerous outdoor activities, we might send you communications about other outdoor activities that we think your group might be interested in.
As part of our profiling techniques, we will use third party lifestyle data to enrich our insight and understanding of guests’ interests and preferences. Such information is compiled using publicly available data about you, for example number of children, age of children, household income, these can be at a variety of levels from postcode area to individual households.
If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way we can only remove you from this by opting you out of all other marketing communications. If you wish to do this please contact us at data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate.
Cookies and other similar technologies
We use cookies and other similar technologies (e.g. pixel tags or links) to remember you when you visit our websites and Apps and so we can improve your online experience to suit your needs. These help us understand how you and others use our websites and Apps, view our services and respond to our advertising, so we can tailor direct marketing and enhance our overall service offering. This also saves you from re-inputting information when you return to the websites or Apps.
When you receive direct marketing from us via email, we may use technology e.g. pixel tags or links to determine your use of and interest in our direct marketing.  For more information about the cookies and other similar technologies that we use, the purposes we use them for, and how to disable them, please visit our cookies policy.
Who do we share this information with?
Our group - your personal information may be shared with other companies within the Center Parcs group of companies based in the UK and Ireland because we operate centralised systems. We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business but will always comply with the applicable data protection laws and keep your personal information secure.
Third parties - we may share your personal information with selected third parties.  Such as our suppliers, including businesses who provide IT services, operate activities in our Villages, our concession partners (i.e. the shops and restaurants operated by third parties within our Villages), property managers, printing and fulfilment agencies, marketing, research and communications agencies. Other third parties include our insurers, auditors and other professional advisers.
They only use the personal information we give them to provide their services. We only give them the personal information that they actually need in order to provide the services to us and all suppliers we engage are contractually required to ensure that they too comply with applicable data protection laws and keep your personal information secure.
Social media partners - we share certain personal information about you with social media partners, such as Facebook and Twitter to participate in their Custom Audience and/or Lookalike Audience programs. This helps us to communicate with you more effectively and ensures that when you are on those platforms, you are more likely to see adverts about Center Parcs if you are likely to be interested in them. In order to do this, we will share your email address or phone number with the relevant social media partner. If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way we can only remove you from this by opting you out of all other marketing communications. If you wish to do this please contact us at data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate.
Legal requirements - in some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information by law, because a Court or the police or other law enforcement agency has requested it using the appropriate channels.
Where in the world do we hold your information?
Your data may occasionally be processed and held by third parties outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Whereas in the UK and EEA, we implement a high standard of data protection law, some parts of the world do not implement such stringent laws. As a result, if we do send personal information overseas we will make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure it is protected in accordance with European data protection laws. These might include: -
·         Sending personal information only to countries that European Authorities have approved as having adequate data protection laws in place e.g. , Canada or Switzerland;
·         Sending personal data to organisations which are members of a scheme which has been approved by European Authorities as achieving adequate protection e.g. Privacy Shield; or
·         Entering into a standard form of contract with the recipient which European Authorities have approved as providing adequate protection.
If you want to know more about how we keep your data secure when it is transferred internationally, please contact us using data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate.
How long do we keep your information?
We only hold your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide services to you unless there is a requirement to hold that information for a longer period – for example our insurers require us to hold certain information for certain periods of time, or we may be subject to a statutory obligation to keep hold of your information.
If there is a possibility that you may have a legal claim against us, for example if you have had an accident in one of our Villages, or have made a complaint about a break with us, then we will hold your information for the duration of any statutory limitation period associated with such legal claims.
As a result, the length of time that we keep your information for will vary depending on the purposes for which we have it. In any event, we will review what information we need on an ongoing basis and will only retain it for the minimum amount of time that we need it for, or are legally obliged to keep it for.
If you would like more information about how long your personal information will be held for, you can contact us at data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate.
How secure is your information?
Our website is secured using TLS 1.2. This is the same level of security that all major UK banks use for their online banking, this means we encrypt every keystroke and mouse click on our website. All the data you provide us is held in our secure data centres which are further encrypted. We continue to review and amend our security practices to ensure we protect your data in this evolving security landscape.
Your data is important to us so please ensure you log out from our website if you are using a shared computer and never share your account information.
If at any point you suspect or become aware of a security incident (i.e. your password is stolen or you receive suspicious communication from someone holding themselves out to be a Center Parcs employee or from a dupe website claiming to be affiliated with Center Parcs), please forward the communication to us or report the incident by email to data.protection@centerparcs.co.uk or at data.protection@centerparcs.ie as appropriate _ _ as soon as possible. If you have been the victim of a fraudulent transaction please always contact the police and/or your bank in the first instance to ensure your own finances are secure.

New data protection laws also give you a number of additional rights including the right to request to have your personal data erased or transferred either to you or a third party in a commonly structured format and to have your personal information restricted. Please be aware that these latter rights only apply in limited circumstances and therefore even if you wish to exercise them, we may not always be required to comply.
