Privacy - Cengage
Cengage is Committed to Respecting your Privacy
We have a Global Privacy Policy that protects all the Personal Information we receive from you as well as information we receive from schools and other third parties. It protects information collected online as well as offline.

These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them.
We also want our privacy practices to be very clear so you can interact with us in confidence. The statements and links below may answer your questions about how we handle your Personal Information.

Privacy Statement for Hosted School Websites
Certain Cengage businesses, like Ed2Go, administer websites that provide course materials and services for educational institutions and companies. Information collected on these websites is only used by us to support our clients and provide the services requested by the course instructors. We do not use this information for our own purposes. Most educational institution student course records are also protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For information on your company or school's privacy policies, please contact the administration.
Our hosted websites may offer students and professionals the opportunity to interact directly with Cengage Learning.  If so, the Cengage  Privacy Notice **** will apply to that information.

Access to sensitive Personal Information is limited to those workers and service providers who have a need to access the information to perform tasks for Cengage. Sensitive Personal Information is only disclosed to third parties in accordance with Cengage's established privacy and security policy.
