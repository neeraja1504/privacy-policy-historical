In addition, though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a subpoena, a court order, or other legal process.
Central Hudson has implemented policy guidelines and security features to access specific customer-account information and to help safeguard customer-specific account information from unauthorized access or improper use.
