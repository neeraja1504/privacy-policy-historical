Privacy Policy Details
Lawful basis for ‘processing your data’
We process personal information on the following bases:
Customers are processed on a contractual basis as they have perpetual licences to access and use their training courses within the ‘portal’.
Enquirers and subscribers who have not purchased and so not opened an account are processed under the Privacy and electronic communication regulations for ‘soft opt-in’ rules.
More recent subscribers will have been also offered the opportunity to consent to their data being processed and to receive marketing material.
Any customer or subscriber can exclude themselves from receiving marketing material by simply unsubscribing using the facility included on every communication.
Personal data for International Customers
We are based in the UK and comply with all local privacy regulations, we cannot legislate for any regulations or laws that may apply differently in other countries. Submitting your personal data is done so strictly on that basis and the data of any foreign nationals that we may hold as a result is the responsibility of the person who submits it. If you would like us to remove any data please contact us and advise us as detailed above
Confirming that you are the subscriber
We provide individuals with privacy information at the time we collect their personal data from them and confirm it immediately with a follow up email to confirm that it is you who has submitted the data and to confirm that our customers are aware of our position on personal information
Marketing to Children
In line with the new data laws, on registration we ask the customer to confirm that they consent to receive marketing information and that you are 16 or over.
Our courses are designed for adult education only.
Use of ‘electronic communications’
We try to use the most popular and convenient forms of electronic communication. This could include email or sms or for example, new and emerging forms of communication such as Facebook messenger. Where we ask for consent to receive communications we are doing this in general to cover all forms of electronic communication- if you wish to be excluded from any simply use the unsubscribe link on every communication or contact us as above.
Use of Cookies
As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, designed to improve your experience. For more information on cookies and how we use them please refer to our separate cookie policy, which describes what information they gather, how we use it, why we sometimes need to store these cookies and how you can remove them if you wish to.
How do we use ‘Profiling’
To avoid wasteful or potentially annoying marketing where products are not appropriate, we use various profiling tools to help us select just the customers whom we believe will be interested in a particular offer or piece of information. Clearly, this can never be 100% accurate but we hope it helps us provide information that is relevant and of interest to you rather than sending everything that is available on our website. To exclude yourself from any profiling and to just receive everything, please contact us and advise us of your wishes.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We regularly review and, where necessary, update our privacy information and should there be any change of use of our privacy information, we’ll communicate the changes to individuals before starting any new processing.
