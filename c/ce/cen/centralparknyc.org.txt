Use of Information
Internal Use
We will use your personally identifiable information in order to respond to your request, process your contribution or fulfill your online order. Your credit card information will be temporarily stored on a secured server only for as long as necessary to process your payment.
We may use your information to inform you of events, send you CPC newsletters, request monetary contributions and send you promotions and updates about the Park. Out of respect for your privacy, e-mail recipients may opt out of receiving e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the e-mail message, changing your user profile, e-mailing membership@centralparknyc.org, or calling 212-310-6600.
From time to time, CPC will provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys. Unless we inform you otherwise, your voluntary participation in these surveys is completely anonymous. We use the information gathered from the surveys to improve the experience of visitors to Central Park and CPC's website.
CPC may combine the information you provide us online with other personally identifiable information, such as geographical information and purchase history, in order to better serve our visitors.
CPC's website automatically collects some anonymous "non-personally identifiable" aggregate information, which may include visitors' browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer or Firefox), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet Service Providers, and other similar information. The information collected is used for statistical purposes to monitor how CPC's online visitors navigate our website, allowing us to tailor our website to better accommodate our visitors.
External Use
Third Party Vendors
CPC may engage third-party vendors in order to help us better service our visitors and customers. CPC requires its vendors by contract to maintain the confidentiality and security of CPC information to which they are provided access and restricts the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by CPC. In cases when users leave CPC's website to visit one of its vendors' websites, users are encouraged to become familiar with the privacy statement of each website they visit.
Sharing CPC's List of Supporters
CPC may, on occasion, share the name and the address of online and offline members and supporters with other like-minded organizations. Exchanging our list with other reputable charitable organizations is the most cost effective way to find new supporters. As part of CPC's exchange policy, other organizations will have access to a shared list for a limited time and will not have continued access to CPC's list unless an individual voluntarily chooses to respond to their initial mailing. If you prefer not to have your name and address shared in this way, you may request to have your information removed from a shared list at any time by contacting membership@centralparknyc.org, or calling 212-310-6672. CPC will not intentionally disclose any personal information about you (such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card number, or e-mail address) to any third party if you elect to opt out.
Please note: CPC does not rent or sell donor lists. CPC never shares the information we receive from customers making online purchases from the Central Park Store.
Links to Other Websites
Users may find content on CPC's website that links to the websites and services of our partners, sponsors, or other third parties. In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects, or are established with persons or entities that have a significant connection to or relationship with our website. Although every effort is made to ensure that website referrals are to reputable and relevant sources, CPC does not control the content or links that appear on these websites. In addition, these websites or services, including their content and links, may change. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies, or no policy at all. CPC maintains a policy against the non-consensual collection or sharing of personal information and encourages visitors to review the privacy policies of any websites they visit to ensure their personal information is being protected.

Data Security
CPC processes credit card information using secure socket layering (SSL) encryption technology, which protects against interception of your information by third parties. SSL is the standard for most browsers and servers and encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Children
CPC takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children, and does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal data to CPC. CPC encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrenâs internet usage and help enforce this privacy policy by instructing children to never provide personal data to CPC without their permission. In the event CPC learns they have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, CPC will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from CPC records.
Cookies
The CPC website uses cookies (small files that store information on your computer's web browser) to enhance user experience on the website. Cookies are used to perform certain functions such as saving passwords, personal interests and preferences; delivering content specific to these interests and preferences; and analyzing website activity and user behavior on the website. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and delete any cookies you receive.
Changes to Privacy Policy
CPC reserves the right to modify our policy as needed. A revised policy will apply only to information collected after the date that the new policy is posted.
California Privacy Rights
Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a California resident and your relationship with CPC is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may request certain data regarding CPC's disclosure, if any, of your personal information to third parties for the third partiesâ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail message to membership@centralparknyc.org with "Request for California Privacy Information" in the subject line.

If you are using our website, shopping online in the Central Park Store, purchasing tickets for events or tours, becoming a member, or otherwise providing us with your information, you should know that such information will be processed in the United States, and the United States' privacy laws may be different from the laws applicable where you are located.
