Centercode Privacy Policy | Centercode
Effective May 25th, 2018
Introduction
The following is intended to explain how Centercode uses this website, and any information we collect, to market and sell our products, and to explain the tools, services, and technologies we leverage to do so. Above all, our goal is to always be responsible in how we collect, store, and use your information, while complying with all relevant regulations.
To simplify this for our audience, we’ve split our policy into two parts. The first section is intended to provide a walk-through of the primary ways we handle your data. These are the things that we feel are most interesting to the majority of our audience. The second section provides the comprehensive details.
Regardless, we comply with and are passionate about this entire policy, and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at privacy@centercode.com.
Intended Audiences
The primary audience of this website is businesses interested in learning more about Centercode and its offerings. The secondary audiences are individuals seeking employment at Centercode, vendors, and others seeking to have a business relationship with us.
If you’re not with a business, or looking for a job, but rather are an individual interested in testing new products, you should instead visit our Betabound portal (which has its own Privacy Policy). Betabound is always looking for enthusiastic testers.
Alternatively, if you’re a company actively using the Centercode Platform or our services, or are a user of such a company, please see our Customer Data Handling Policies.
Data Handling Overview
The following explains how your data is handled as you navigate and interact with Centercode and our website.
Visitor Tracking
When you visit our website, your activity as you navigate is tracked by Google Analytics and Marketo via cookies. Google Analytics lets us study aggregated (or de-identified) data about our traffic patterns in order to improve our site design and the information we offer. Marketo tracks your ongoing activity on our site. If at some point you choose to provide information to us that reveals your identity, then your prior activity will be matched to your new record in Marketo. This is intended to help us to prioritize our efforts by focusing on our most engaged visitors.
Gated Content
We offer significant industry and educational resources on our site. These include things like white papers, ebooks, and recorded webinars, and are typically “gated”, meaning we require information from you in order to download them. Our goal in investing significant resources in developing these valuable materials is to create an opportunity to learn about you and begin building a relationship. To achieve this goal, we use Marketo to collect your full name and job title, email address, phone number, company name and size, and the intent of your download (e.g. researching vs. interested in purchasing).
We use this information to determine your likely interest in our offerings. If we feel we’re a fit, the information we collected is sent to our CRM System (Insightly). We use Zapier to make this transfer, and leverage a platform known as Clearbit to enrich this data, reducing what we need to ask of you directly.
If we feel you’re an ideal prospect, a member of our internal account team will study your company and reach out to attempt to continue to build a relationship with you, in the hope that there will be an opportunity to work together. Our team is not pushy, and are trained to be as consultative as possible. If you ask that they stop contacting you, they’ll politely and immediately respect your wishes, and follow an internal process to remove your data.
By downloading our gated content, you’ll likely receive marketing email from us, such as future content and webinar announcements. We consider your attention limited and time valuable, and therefore deliberately limit our outreach. In addition, every email will include a very simple opt-out mechanism, which will remove you from future outreach.
Other Web Site Activities
Beyond downloading content, there are a few other ways to engage with us that do collect personal or use information.
In-Site Chat – You’ll notice a small circle in the bottom right of our site. This allows you to communicate with us in real-time via Intercom. While you don’t need to provide any personal information to use our real-time chat (and we don’t send information to it), your email will be requested if we’re not actively available, so that we can get back to you.
Webinar Registration – If you happen to participate in any of our webinars, the Zoom platform will collect basic contact information in order to access our live webinar event. Recorded webinars do not require interacting with Zoom.
Event Registration – If you register to attend one of our live events (e.g. Conference, Roadshows), your contact information will be collected and stored on the Bizzabo events management platform.
Meeting Scheduling – If you schedule a meeting with our team, we’ll collect basic contact information and schedule preferences via the YouCanBookMe platform. Alternatively, our sales team uses Calendly for individual meeting scheduling.
Email, Calendar, and Drive – Our back-office productivity platform is the business version of G Suite , including Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. If we interact with you directly, these email and calendar details will be stored by Google.
Job Applications – If you apply for a job on our site, you’ll be asked to provide information relevant to the position via to the JazzHR Applicant Tracking system. We use this platform for all applicant communication and scheduling.
Where relevant, these systems typically feed information to or from Marketo (for marketing automation) and Insightly (for CRM), which are our primary marketing and sales platforms. Our goal is to always centralize information as much as possible, but in every case, we manage your data, know where it is, and how to delete it.
Finally, it’s important to understand that we only use your information for our own purposes. We never sell your information, and none of the systems or partners that we leverage have that right.
