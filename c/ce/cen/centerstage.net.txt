Our Privacy Policy - Chicago.com
Introduction
To provide you with a single source for purchasing hotel reservations, Chicago.com has engaged Priceline Partner Network Limited ('PPN') to host this private label travel Web site. In order to make a reservation on this Web site it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to PPN to execute the purchase. Your identity and other relevant details are then provided to the hotel company to process the reservation.
The following describes the privacy policy (as amended or otherwise changed from time to time, the 'Privacy Policy') applicable to our services available through the Chicago.com web site (the 'Site') from PPN, and also describes certain practices related to the EU Safe Harbor (as defined below). Certain services which you may access on the Site are provided by our third party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party (see 'Sharing Your Personal Data-Certain Services,' below). By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your personal data described in this Privacy Policy.
On occasion PPN may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology.

By providing any Personal Data of another traveler, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Personal Data of other travelers is collected only for the purpose of providing such other travelers' names to the appropriate travel supplier, such as the airline on which travel will occur.

We may revise this list from time to time if we decide to offer additional services through these or other third-party partners.
PPN's Agents : Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, PPN hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail) analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
