This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to Playboy Enterprises, Inc.'s and Playboy.com, Inc's (collectively "Playboy") family of websites (the "Sites").Â  These include playboy.com; cyber.playboy.com; and any other websites at which this Policy appears.Â  It does NOT apply to other online or offline websites, products or services of Playboy or Playboy's affiliates. This Policy explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it.Â  We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes to the Policy by posting the new Policy here and changing the "Effective Date" at the top.Â  We may also use alternative methods to alert you to changes to the Policy.Â  We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.Â  By using or navigating any of the Sites or any portion of the Sites, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy or any modified Policy as posted.Â  If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use or visit any of the Sites or any portion of the Sites.
We collect personal information that you provide to us such as your name, e-mail address, street address and telephone number. We also collect your credit card number, credit card expiration date and banking information from you.Â  We generally collect this personal information on our registration and order forms when you sign up to receive products or services from one of the Sites.Â  When you participate in special events such as contests and polls, you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail, username and password, telephone number and birth date.Â  We may also collect information from our online surveys if you choose to participate, such as age, gender and income level.
When you visit any of our Sites, we collect certain anonymous demographic information about you, including your IP address, zip code and browser program. We also collect information regarding your use of the Sites through the use of cookies (see below for more about cookies).

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We will maintain a record or notes of communications with you regarding your account.
We use your information in order to process your credit card payments, to fulfill your orders and/or requests, to facilitate your viewing of our Sites, to communicate with you, and to provide you with information about Playboy, some of our partners and third party companies in which we think you may be interested. We also use this information to compile broad demographic and Site usage information about our users in general that does not contain anything that could be used to identify you personally.
Playboy uses your e-mail address to contact you when necessary and to send periodic e-mail newsletters and promotional e-mails to you about services and products offered by us as well as by third party companies in which we think you may be interested.
We use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information to tailor your experiences at our Sites by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences.Â  Anonymous demographic information is shared with advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis.

We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Playboy, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
In the event of a change in ownership or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all user information collected in connection with the Sites, including but not limited to email addresses, to a separate entity.Â  Playboy will notify you (via a posting on the Sites or the Policy or via email (in our discretion)) of such a transfer, and you may choose to modify your registration information at that time. This means that if you are concerned about your personal data migrating to a new owner, you can deactivate your account.
