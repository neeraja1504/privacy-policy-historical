We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
However, the internet and mobile web are inherently insecure and so we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.
If we retain personally identifiable information (‘PII”) on our systems, we restrict access to PII to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Websites, products and services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Currently, Bidtellect retains Non-PII collected to report ad delivery (see, “Ad Delivery & Reporting” above) for up to six (6) months. However, other Non-PII stored in Cookies or in aggregate statistics, reports and summaries regarding ad delivery, and PII in registered user accounts may be retained indefinitely.
Bidtellect reserves the right to delete any or all Non-PII or PII that relates to you at any time and in Bidtellect’s sole discretion, notwithstanding its normal data retention policies. If Bidtellect changes its retention data policies by updating this Privacy Policy, its new policies will apply to all data then retained by Bidtellect.
