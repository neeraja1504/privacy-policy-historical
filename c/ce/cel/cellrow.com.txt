What information does Transworld collect?
Transworld does not collect personally identifiable information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us.

Transworld does not currently sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that account holders voluntarily provide in any account registration or subscription lifespan. This information is used to better understand how account holders use the Site, to support related transactions made on the site, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to them. However, this data in an aggregate form without any personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. For example, we may provide information to a third party about how many holders who selected "movies" as an interest, or how many of our account holders overall selected ringtones as an interest and are between the ages of 17 and 24. Should you change your mind about the information you've provided to us, should you no longer wish to receive information from please follow the links on how to unsubscribe. Individuals under 13 years of age
Pursuant to the provisions of the 1998 Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), our policy is to refuse individuals under the age of 13 years of age to submit information to the Site or to install and/or use the Transworld Features. We therefore do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Transworld Features.
Third party links and co-brand relationships
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites to link to, and frame within, the Site. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors and account holders. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Transworld Features and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback on not only the Transworld Features, but for sites each links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).

If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes within this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
