Last Changes to Privacy Policy: February 12, 2019
CellarTracker! LLC (collectively “CellarTracker” or “we”, “us”, or “our”) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information when you interact with the cellartracker.com website and mobile applications (“Sites”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the kinds of information we may gather from your use of the Sites; why we gather your information; what we use your personal information for; when we might disclose your personal information; and how you can manage your personal information.
This Privacy Policy applies to CellarTracker’s websites, mobile applications, emails we send, as well as information we collect when you interact with us through our services and other websites.
By visiting the Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of the Sites and our affiliate websites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
