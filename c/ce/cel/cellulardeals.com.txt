Simplexity will notify you of:
What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site

What Information We Collect and How We Use It
Location Information
We collect location information in order to improve your shopping experience. If you shop for location-specific products such as a wireless or satellite rate plan, we ask for a zip code and record this information via a cookie so that we may display only services which are available in your area. We also save this information so that we don’t have to ask for it again on your next visit.
Information from IP addresses is used to help administer our Web site, to examine overall traffic trends, and to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information
When you place an order for products or services we collect certain types of personally identifiable information required to fulfill those products or services, including (1) contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number); (2) payment information (such as credit card number); and/or (3) ID verification information (such as credit card number, date of birth, Social Security Number, or Driver's License Number).
We collect ID verification information required by the service provider(s) you select to process your application, and we, or the service provider, may perform an identity and/or credit check as a part of our fraud protection and order fulfillment process. In the event that your order is not approved by the service provider of your choice without a deposit, we will also submit your data to an alternate service provider who also may perform an identity and/or credit check.
If you would like to place an order but are reluctant to provide this information online, you may provide it to us by telephone during normal business hours. For wireless products and services, telephone agents are available when the Order By Phone button is visible on one of the shopping pages of our site. Simply click on this button to speak to an agent and provide your information over the phone. For home connectivity services, telephone agents are available during normal business hours. They can be reached at 1-800-998-3474 for satellite services and 1-800-401-0158 for security services.
We use the contact information you provide to communicate with you, such as to send you order confirmations, respond to your inquiries, provide you with important product update, warranty, or safety information. In addition, we use contact information you provide to offer you additional products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, including but not limited to newsletters from wireoffers.com, an affiliated site. You can easily opt out of a newsletter by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of these e-mails. We do not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes, unless you authorize us to do so.
Forward-To-A-Friend and Refer-A-Friend
If you choose to use our email forwarding functionality or our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend the forwarded email or a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site, as applicable. We store this information for the sole purpose of forwarding the email or sending the one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at newsletter@simplexity.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Supplementation of Information
We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside records (e.g., information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
Sharing of Your Information
Please be assured that any third parties who have access to the contact information you provide, including our subsidiary site, agents, contractors and business affiliates have agreed to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.
To fulfill your requests for products and services, we may need to share some of your personally identifiable information with the provider from which you have requested service. More specifically, when you place an order for a new account, we will share contact and ID verification information required by the service provider to provide you with its services. The provider may use this information for credit approval, service activation, and from time to time, for its own marketing purposes. You should consult the service providers' respective privacy policies, as this Notice does not cover their use of your information. Also, if applicable, your shipping information will be shared with a shipping company such as FedEx, for the purposes of delivering your order.
We work closely with trusted third party business affiliates to provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you. We may share the contact information you provide with trusted third parties for the purposes of analyzing it to make your customer experience better or for offering products and services to you. In addition, you can access Simplexity through many third-party co-branded Web sites. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by Simplexity," you are on a co-branded page. Whenever you provide contact information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you access Simplexity. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover their use of your information.
Sharing of Affiliate Information in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process
For wireless services, information submitted by potential Affiliates in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process is submitted to Linkshare. Linkshare's privacy policy can be found at www.linkshare.com. For home connectivity services, information submitted by potential Affiliates in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process may be submitted to Commission Junction. Commission Junction's privacy policy can be found at www.commissionjunction.com.
Third Party Sharing of Information
Simplexity sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions, affiliations, sponsorships) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit or authorize Simplexity to provide to participate in the site activity.
Live Help Function
To better serve you and respond to your questions regarding our wireless and home connectivity products or services, we also maintain a Live Help function through which we can respond, in real time, to your questions about our products and services. This information enables us to understand the types of questions our users have about our products and services so that we may continue to improve our content and offerings.
Other Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze service usage.
Legal Process/Disclaimer
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request.
Choices/Opt Out
If you prefer not to receive marketing information, including emails, from us, or wish to fully deactivate your account information from our records if you are no longer an active customer, simply let us know via certified mail to Simplexity, c/o Privacy Opt Out, 10790 Parkridge Boulevard, Suite 200, Reston, VA 20191 or via e-mail to privacypolicy@simplexity.com. Please note that even if you choose to opt out of marketing programs, if you are an active customer we will continue to send you important service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information) which is not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
Cookies
Cookies are used by your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use both session and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites.

Links
This site may contain links to other Web sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Our privacy policy does not cover these third parties' use of information. Visitors should consult the other companies' and sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
Security
We have put in place multiple levels of physical and electronic security to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. These measures include secure web pages, VeriSign SSL certificate ensuring the privacy and security of order information, and HackerSafe certification, representing the highest security scanning standards of the U.S. government and all major credit card providers.
