Once you register for the Services, you may fill out an account profile. We receive any profile information that you provide including your bio, photograph, organization, language, and interests; links to your social media pages, websites, or blogs; and community Contributions. Contributions include posting resources to your profile or groups, posting information on forums, and providing reviews of resources other users post.

Combining Information
If we combine any information with your personal information, such as your registration information, we will treat all of that information as personal information.
Information We Don’t Collect

We do not receive information about users from any third parties, or combine, augment, extend the information that we collect with data from third party sources. We do not collect sensitive information such as health, financial, biometric, or geolocation data on the Services. Because the Services are directed to teachers and parents, we also do not knowingly collect personal information (including educational records and information about free or reduced lunch status) from preschool or K-12 students or children under the age of 12. Please see the section on Children’s Information below for more information.

We will share information with service providers that will use the donors’ information only as necessary to provide their services to us.

We will delete your information within 14 days after receiving and reviewing your request. Please note that we do not have a time-period after which we will automatically delete or limit the retention of any information after inactivity. Because your Contributions are connected to your Curriki account and we want to make as many Contributions as possible available through the Services, we will not delete your account or the personal information associated with it.
You can also choose which groups you would like to join, what members you would like to follow, and what mailings to receive. When you submit a resource to be included on the site, you can choose to share it publicly or privately, with only yourself or members of the group where you upload it. If you would like to delete a resource, you can email us at privacy@curriki.org.

Access and Third Party Sharing
We currently do not provide an option for users to export or download all of the information Curriki receives from them. Nor do we provide authorized account managers or legacy contacts to access and download users’ data on their behalf.
As a matter of course, we do not provide users with a list of all of the personal information we share with third parties, however, you may write to us at privacy@curriki.org if you have questions about what personal information we share with third parties.
Other
Children’s Privacy
Curriki is not directed to children under 13. While a child under 13 is not technically constrained from creating an account, we don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 online or offline or display advertisements to them. Similarly, we don’t obtain verifiable parental consent, provide parents with direct notice, or get their consent to use data for “internal operations” under COPPA. Because we don’t provide the Services to children under 13, we don’t restrict their purchases or activity on the Services or participate in any FTC safe harbor program.
If we find out that a child under 13 has given us personal information, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has given us personal information, please contact us at privacy@curriki.org. We will respond to all requests from parents, guardians, or others to prevent further collection of any child’s information.
Minors’ Privacy
The Services are directed to adults such as educators and parents. That said, we do not constrain children between the ages of 13-18 from creating accounts. If they do so, we may collect personal information from them as described above.
Student Privacy
Note that Curriki provides a way for educators and parents to share and access educational materials for K-12 school purposes. It does NOT collect student education records or students’ personal information. No such data is entered into Curriki’s Services. Thus, Curriki necessarily does not provide a way for students to review such information; does not take any steps to ensure the accuracy of such information; does not have a process for schools, parents, or students to modify such information; does not allow schools, parents, or students to submit requests to modify such information; and has no deadline for making such modifications. Similarly, there is no behavioral or contextual advertising based on student data and third parties cannot use such data to create profiles or otherwise use such data to target advertising to students, parents, teachers, or schools.
Given that we don’t collect student education records and we are not under the control of any educational institutions, we not provide additional information about FERPA rights. Likewise we do not disclose information as Directory Information under FERPA, disclose information pursuant to FERPA exceptions, or shift any liability or responsibility for parental consent to schools or districts.
Do Not Track
We do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from browsers, although you may disable tracking by managing the cookie settings in your browser. We have not signed any other privacy pledges or certifications.
International Users
The Services are hosted in the United States and intended for users in the United States. If you access the Services from the European Union or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States for storage and processing. By providing your information you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please also note that this policy is not available in any other language besides English.
Security
We provide reasonable security to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use encryption to safeguard your data when it is in transit. We limit employee access to user information and we restrict access for unauthorized individuals to users’ data. Users are not required to use two-factor authentication to access their accounts.
No security measures are 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. We currently do not engage an auditor to review our privacy and security compliance. In the event of a security incident, we will provide users with notice consistent with applicable data breach notification laws.
Links to Other Websites
Our Services may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Please also be aware that because Curriki is not directed to children, we cannot guarantee whether links to outbound websites on the Services are age-appropriate for children. Third party websites linked to our Services may also use cookies and may track your activities across websites and over time. We encourage you read the privacy statements of these websites to learn more about how they collect, use, and share your information, including through the use of cookies
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will have an opportunity to review any material changes to this policy at the time those changes become effective. If we make any material changes, we will notify you know through the Services, by email, or other communication. For example, if we change the context in which we collect your data, change our data collection practices, or if our practices become inconsistent with contractual requirements that we may have, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy, notify you, and obtain any required consent.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy periodically to stay up-to-date about our privacy practices. As long as you use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and any updates we make to it. You can always view previous versions of our Privacy Policy here.
