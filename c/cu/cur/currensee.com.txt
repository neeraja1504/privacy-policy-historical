Introduction
Currensee, Inc (“Currensee”, “we” or “us”) desires to protect the privacy of our visitors and members in Currensee’s social trader network at www.currensee.com (the “Site”).
1. Safeguarding private information
This privacy and security policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to provide you notice of our information management practices, including the types of information gathered and how it is used and safeguarded. Your use of this Site constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, which are hereby incorporated by reference. http://www.currensee.com/terms-of-use
Our employees and third-party service providers do not have access to private data, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or as otherwise disclosed to you.
2. Collection and Our Use of Information
We will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our Site unless you voluntarily choose to provide that information to us. Any personally identifiable information that you provide to us via our Site will be used only for such purposes as are described either in this Privacy Policy (including the terms of use) or at the point of collection, such as to respond to your questions or comments, to register, to send you a requested brochure or to otherwise send information to you.
3. Aggregate and Statistical Data
We may collect certain aggregate data called web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies when you visit the Site (collectively, the “Aggregate and Statistical Data”). For instance, when you visit the Site, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited the Site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider. Neither the web log information nor cookies (as discussed below) collects any personal information. They do not contain personal information, such as your name or e-mail address, and in no way are used to identify our users. Aggregate and Statistical Data helps us design the Site, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes.
4. Personally Identifiable Information
You may also be asked to provide personally identifiable information on the Site, which may include your name, address, telephone number, forex trading account number, credit card number and e-mail address (your “Personally Identifiable Information”). This information may be gathered when feedback or e-mails are sent to the Site, when you register for an account, use our service, post information on the Site or use a credit card to pay for any payments. In all cases, you have the option of providing us with the Personally Identifiable Information, though certain services and features may not be available to you if you do not provide personally identifiable information. You agree that we may contact you to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you. At that time, you will be offered the opportunity to opt out of this service. You may remove your e-mail address from the list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every e-mail. We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information or share it with anyone except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.

We may store cookies on your computer or other technology to improve the quality of your visit to our Site, and to remember certain user attributes.

First, we use it to track general information about our users. The information collected through cookies is non-personally identifiable information and we use this information for statistical and market research purposes. We also give you the option to use cookies to establish a link between your computer and Currensee , to help authenticate you and to customize the Site’s content so that the information made available is more likely to be of interest to you.

7. Security Technology
Currensee uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to provide a secure environment for all transactions and to protect certain information that you submit from loss, misuse and alteration while under our control. This type of technology also protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than Currensee while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our Web sites are secure and that they meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
When you access our member areas, you are required to login by providing your username and your password. To preserve privacy and confidentiality, your login information is transmitted in an encrypted format through a multi-factor authentication process.
