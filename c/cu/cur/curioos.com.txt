We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.

Third-Party Advertising Partners
We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet.
These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.
Our third party advertising partners may use information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Curioos.
Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partners such as TellApart and Yahoo.

Social Media Interactions
Curioos invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Curioos. com. Curioos does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a previously-given Facebook "Like" through Curioos, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Curioos’ websites. You can also delete comments made while at Curioos.com from your Facebook Page.

We may allow you to sign in to your Curioos.com account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from Curioos. Curioos will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information.
