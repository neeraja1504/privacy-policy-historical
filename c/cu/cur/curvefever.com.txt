In this privacy notice we describe:
The ways we collect personal data about you when you play Curve Fever or subscribe to  our newsletter, when you visit our website, and why we do so,
How we use your personal data, and
The choices you have about your personal data.
As a controller, we are committed to a lawful, fair and transparent processing of personal data, adhering to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
1. The data we process
When you play our game, make an account or a purchase of in-game currency, post or respond to messages on our forum, or interact with us, we process the following information:
Username and email address.
The contents of forum posts, private messages and chat messages
Account information (including a country if you provided one) and payment information.
Login and navigational data.
Bug reports, suggestions for improvements
Customer support messages
In addition, when you visit our website or play our game, we and our analytics, payment and advertizing providers collect and process data such as your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI), data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language, and data about how you use the game and website. For this purpose our partners are Google Analytics and DeltaDNA.
2. What do we use the data for, and on what legal basis
We use username and email address to provide you with an account (a contract with you) or when you subscribe to our newsletter (on the basis of your consent).
We use the content of forum posts, private messages and chat messages to provide you with the service (a contract with you) and to monitor content for compliance with our community rules (the legitimate interest of us and other players to have a safe environment to play our games in).
We use account information and payment information to provide you with the game, and the possibility to buy in-game currency (a contract with you).
We use login and navigational data to help with navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website (a contract with you). Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.
We use bug reports and suggestions for improvements for exactly those purposes: bug report and to communicate about possible improvement to our websites and games (our legitimate interest in being able to hear about issues with our service and to troubleshoot).
We use customers support message to provide support to you (a contract with you).
We use analytics and advertising data, and social plug-ins to be able to allow third-parties to show you ads on our websites so that we can generate revenue (our legitimate interest).
3. Who we share data with
We do not actively share data with any third-parties, other than processors acting on our behalf.
We have also engaged third-parties for analytics and advertising, and social plug-ins. How they capture and use data is described under Cookies and other technologies.
Finally, as we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.
4. How long and where do we store data
If you made an account, we store data until you delete your account. We store other non-account related personal data that we collect for up to a year, and only aggregate data after that time. Aggregation data means that we can no longer look at data for individual players.
When a third-party service provider is a controller, they may keep data as well, either for a shorter or longer period.
We store newsletter subscriber information until such subscriber indicates they no longer want to receive the newsletter.
We store analytics and advertising data (insofar we have access) for up to 5 years to be able to analyze seasonal and mid-term trends.
5. How do we protect data
Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, we have taken the following technical and organizational measures:
Access to our database and user accounts with third-party service providers is protected with access control.
Access to the database is limited, not all staff in our organization have full access.
We do not actively monitor the security of our database and need to rely on our processors to notify us of any data breaches.
6. Transfer of your personal data
You should also know that your personal data may be transferred from your home country to third parties. If you are an EU resident, this could imply that we also transfer data to countries that do not offer an adequate level of protection for your personal data. When we transfer this data, we will do so only when we have put in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data. Please contact us to get a copy of the safeguards that we have put in place.
7. Children
Our Services are for users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at supporthiddenmonster.games.
For residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, we will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law, either under 13 or under 16, depending on where you live.
8. Your rights
If you reside in the European Union, you have the right to request access to your personal data that we process. You also have the right to rectify incorrect personal data or erase it in certain circumstances, to restrict or object to the processing of your personal data and to receive your data so that you can use it elsewhere (data portability).
Where we process data based on your consent, you also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time but we would like to point out that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the date that you withdrew your consent.
If you would like to exercise any of the above right, you can do so by sending us a mail to privacyhiddenmonster.games . We will then start the process and provide you a link to access the personal data that Curve Fever has on you within 30 days. For your protection, we may take steps to verify identity before responding to your request.
The rights and options described above are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. In addition to those rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.
You can also unsubscribe from our newsletter by clicking the “unsubscribe” link that each newsletter email has.
