Last Revised: June 1, 2018
The following privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to inform you of the policies and procedures that will apply to the collection, security, use and disclosure of any of your personal data collected by Curebit, Inc. dba Talkable ("Talkable", "we", "us", or "our") through Talkable.com ("Site") or in connection with our products and services ("Services"). It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your Personal Data (defined below).
BY PROCEEDING TO USE OUR SITE AND/OR SERVICES YOU CONSENT THAT WE MAY PROCESS THE PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
1. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices, so check back frequently. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page, and where appropriate (for example, if there are material changes to this policy), we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the changes taking effect.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
2.1. Overview. Our primary goals are to provide and improve our products and services, to provide quality customer service, and to enable users to effectively navigate the Site. We may collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data about you and process the same as set forth herein.
2.2. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.
2.3. When you give us your information. You may give us your Personal Data in the following ways: (i) if you sign up for a demo, (ii) sign up for newsletters, (iii) send us an email, and/or sign up for our Services.
3. HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We will use your Personal Data to:
* carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between you and us;
* provide you with Services, products or information, you have requested from us;
* notify you about changes to our Services; or
* ensure that content from our Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device, and
* we may also use your Personal Data to contact you with certain marketing or promotional materials, as well as other information that may be of interest to you. If you no longer consent to such use please send us an email so stating to security@talkable.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
4. NON-PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU
4.1. "Non-Personal Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.
4.2. Log Data. When you visit the Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data, the pages you visit and any search terms you use ("Log Data").
4.3. IP Address. We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as "Personal Network Information" instead of Personal Data. "Log Data" does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled "Service Providers," "Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement" and "Business Transfers." We will use Log Data for any purpose.
4.4. Use of Non-Personal Data. We may also use your Log Data and Personal Network Information to: (i) administer our Site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes; (ii) improve our Site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device; (iii) allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; (iv) as part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure.
4.5 Pixel Tags. In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Personal Data.
4.6 Flash LSOs. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as "Flash Cookies", to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here:  http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
4.7 Google Analytics. We may use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on Your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site and use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site is governed by the Google Analytics’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
5. AGGREGATED DATA
After removing any information that would personally identify you from within the set of Personal Data, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you, we may combine that information with information we collect from other users and customers (collectively the "Aggregated Data") in order to improve the quality and value of Services and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. We may share Aggregated Data (after stripping of any information that would personally identify you) and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.
6. COOKIES/TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Technologies such as cookies or similar technologies are used by us and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These are used in storing content information and preferences, analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited
7. BEHAVIORAL TARGETING / RE-TARGETING
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

These Service Providers have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
