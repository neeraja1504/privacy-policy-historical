Curology - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: April 25, 2019
Curology understands that your personal information, including your health information, is important to you. Therefore, we have developed this privacy and security policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to describe how your personal information may be collected, used and disclosed by Curology, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the medical practices and other healthcare entities with which Curology contracts in order to provide products and services to you, (collectively, “Curology,” “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to websites and/or mobile applications (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”), and/or other digital services (including our social media pages) or email messages (collectively, the “Products”), that are offered or operated by Curology and in which this Privacy Policy is posted or linked.
By using our Websites, purchasing and/or using our Products, and/or providing your personal information to Curology, you acknowledge this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register for an account with Curology through the Website (an “Account,” and collectively with the Websites and the Products, the “Services”).
PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PROVISION IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE, PURCHASE OR USE THE PRODUCTS, PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO CUROLOGY, OR REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or applications that do not link or display this Privacy Policy or that display or link to different privacy policies. In addition to this Privacy Policy, Curology has established Terms of Service that set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of the Website. Please review the Terms of Service carefully since they contain provisions that limit Curology’s liability to your use of the Website and Products.
A copy of the Terms of Service can be found here.
The Personal Information We Collect Through the Services
In connection with the Services, Curology will collect, use and disclose Personal Information as described below.
“Personal Information,” as used in this Privacy Policy, means information associated with or used to identify or contact a specific person. Personal Information we collect may include, but is not limited to, contact information, including, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, age, and gender.
Personal Information also includes certain “Sensitive Personal Information” as may be defined under federal or state law, or as otherwise set forth in Curology policies. Sensitive Personal Information may be subject to stricter regulation and consent requirements than other information. Before providing Sensitive Personal Information to us in any manner, including through our Services, you should carefully consider whether to disclose such Sensitive Personal Information. Sensitive Personal Information that we may collect includes, but is not limited to, location data, health information (including medical records), health background, health status, prescribed and over-the-counter medications, medical ID numbers, driver’s license numbers, laboratory testing results, and full-face and similarly identifiable photos.
If you submit any Personal Information to us relating to other people to us in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and that you permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Any Personal Information you provide to us when you visit or use the Services is voluntary. However, in order to utilize certain Services, you may need to provide Personal Information and/or Sensitive Personal Information.
Subject to the restrictions on the use and disclosure of your Personal Information under applicable law, Curology and our service providers may use your Personal Information and your Sensitive Personal Information to:
Provide teledermatology and related services.
Provide, operate, analyze usage of and improve the Services.
Verify your identity as the holder of an Account.

Market our services and those of third parties that we believe may be of interest to you.
Allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions. Some of these promotions may have additional rules explaining how we will use and disclose your Personal information.
Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
Your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information may be disclosed:
To licensed medical providers (including those who provide healthcare services, drugs or medical devices), so that they may provide you with the teledermatology and related products and services you request.
To our third-party vendors acting on our behalf and to entities with whom we may be collaborating to deliver the Services.
To third parties to permit them to send you marketing communications.
By you, on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public information.

Before using these third-party sites or providing them with your Personal Information, you should carefully review and evaluate the privacy notices for such sites, as Curology has no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
In certain cases, you may be directed to a third-party site to provide information to complete a transaction in connection with the Website. In such cases, any information you provide to such third-party sites directly to such third party will be subject to the applicable third party’s privacy policy and terms of service. For example, Stripe, Inc. (“Stripe”) provides third-party payment processing services for Curology. All payments made to Curology will be processed by Stripe. The privacy policies of Stripe may differ from those of Curology. Any information you submit to Stripe will be governed by its privacy statements.

Curology seeks to employ reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative security measures, designed to safeguard your Personal Information within our organization.
However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.

While these emails will never contain your photos or payment information, they will sometimes include information relating to the details of your treatment (as applicable). Accordingly, it is critical that you safeguard your designated email address and restrict access thereto.
