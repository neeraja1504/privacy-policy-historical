Privacy Policy - Customize.org
Customize.org is committed to providing you the opportunity for a positive experience during your visit to our web site, while respecting and striving to protect your on-line privacy. We have adopted this policy to safeguard your personal information and protect its confidentiality.
Our site may contain links to other sites. We will make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by organizations sponsoring these other sites.
Customize.org collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis only. Personal information may include name, location, email address, etc. The individual information we collect is used only to enhance the on-line experience. We do not sell or transmit personal information to other organizations or third parties.
All personal information you provide to Customize.org is secured on our server with restricted access. We reserve the right to use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and processing functions. Only designated employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted to view your personal data. Employees or agents who violate this privacy policy are subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.
Because Customize.org considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings. While Customize.org uses its best efforts and current technology to implement this Privacy Policy, it cannot, of course, guarantee that information it seeks to protect will be protected under all circumstances, including those beyond its reasonable control.
