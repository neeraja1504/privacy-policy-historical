Privacy | We take confidentiality and privacy very seriously!
The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal information we collect about you when you visit the Customwritings.com web site (www.customwritings.com).
This information is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customise the content and/or layout of our page. We never sell, rent or share any of the information we collect by this method (except anonymous aggregate information) with any third party.
Information we collect as you browse our web site
Our web server automatically collects standard information, including your IP address, browser type, operating system and access times.
Sometimes we may use cookies to customise web page content based on your browser type, IP address or other anonymous information.
About Cookies
Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Many web sites do this whenever a user visits their site in order to monitor visitor traffic.
Cookies themselves only record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user.
Use of optional information
On certain web pages, you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address or other personal information (for example, when requesting a prospectus or brochure). We will not use this information for any other purpose; it is never sold, rented or shared. We will however, use any demographic information you provide for internal market research purposes only.
If you contact us by e-mail to request information, report a problem or provide feedback on our services we will only use the information you provide (including your e-mail address) to respond to your message. We do not share this information in any way.
