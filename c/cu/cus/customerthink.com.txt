GDPR Policy
CustomerThink complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU). GDPR was adopted on April 27, 2016, and becomes enforceable starting May 25, 2018.
CustomerThink is considered a data “controller,” meaning that it “determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.” CustomerThink also uses third-party services as data “processors,” which means “a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.” Mailchimp is a processor for membership contact information including email address and demographic data collected in registration forms. Authorize.net is a data processor for online purchasing; CustomerThink does not store or have access to customer’s credit card data.
To comply with GDPR requirements, CustomerThink will:
Only collect or process data where we believe there is a legitimate interest to fulfill our services or comply with government regulations and laws. For example, an email address is required to sign up for a free email newsletter. Contact information and payment data are required to purchase reports or advertising services online.
Hold information confidentially, and only use it for the purpose for which it was it is intended and for which permission has been granted. No data will be provided or sold to third parties without the user’s explicit consent. For example, when a member signs up for a featured resources such as white papers and reports provided by sponsors, user consent checkboxes must be checked to permit CustomerThink to 1) collect and store personal data, and 2) provide contact information to sponsors.
Make it clear to individuals how their information will be held and used during any registration process, and how they can unsubscribe from further communication. An unsubscribe link is included with all email newsletters.
Show where we obtained our data and on which date it was obtained. Hold data only for a given period; if no activity with a contact on our database, it will be deleted after a maximum of 5 years. This applies to all data, including customers, staff, job candidates and any other information we hold on individuals.
Ensure that all registration forms include an explanation that individual consent is required before including in any communication (e.g. email newsletters), and that consent may be withdrawn at any time. For example, before processing personal information included in a web form, the user must check a box stating: “I permit CustomerThink to collect and store the data in this form.”
Upon request from individuals, remove any personal information within one month. This request may be made by 1) clicking on a link included in all email communications, or 2) writing to service@customerthink.com or 3) calling CustomerThink’s main phone number 619-319-5183.
Train its staff to understand these obligations, and review this policy regularly to ensure it is adapted to legislative changes.
