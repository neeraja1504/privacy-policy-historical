This site provides an external platform for scheduling appointments. Appointment scheduling is integrated in the source code of our website via a script.

3.5 Facebook, Custom Audiences and Facebook-Marketing-Services
1. Within our online offer, due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes, we use the so-called “Facebook-Pixel” of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are an EU resident, Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”).
2. Facebook is certified under the Privacy-Shield Framework and thus guarantees adherence to European data protection law (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active).
3. On the one hand, the Facebook-Pixel enables Facebook to identify users of our online services as the target group for the display of advertisements (so-called “Facebook-Ads”). Accordingly, we use the Facebook-Pixel to ensure as far as possible that the Facebook-Ads we have placed are only displayed to those Facebook-Users who have expressed an interest in our online services or who exhibit certain criteria or attributes (f. ex. interests in certain topics or products as ascertained based on the websites the user has visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called “Custom Audiences”). By using the Facebook-Pixel, we furthermore aim to ensure that our Facebook-Ads correspond to the potential interests of the users and do not come across as disturbing, harassing or annoying. Moreover, using the Facebook-Pixel helps us to understand the effectiveness of Facebook-Ads for statistical and market research purposes in that we can see whether users are directed to our website after clicking on a Facebook-Ad (so-called “Conversion”).
4. The Facebook-Pixel is immediately integrated when one of our web pages is opened, and can store a so-called cookie on your device. If you subsequently log in to Facebook or visit Facebook while logged in, your visit to our online service is assigned to your profile. The Data collected which pertain to you are anonymous to us, and thus do not allow us to infer the identity of users. The Data are, however, stored and processed by Facebook, so that they could be linked to the respective user profile and used by Facebook or for our own market research and advertising purposes. In the event that we should transfer Data to Facebook for matching purposes, such Data are locally encrypted by the browser and are only then transferred to Facebook via a secure https-connection. This is done solely for the purpose of making a comparison with the Data that have likewise been encrypted by Facebook.
5. Facebook processes the Data in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy. Corresponding general information on the display of Facebook-Ads, in Facebook’s Data Usage Policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php. Special information and details on the Facebook-Pixel and how it works can be found in Facebook’s help section: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616.
6. You may opt out of your Data being collected by the Facebook-Pixel and used to display Facebook-Ads. In order to customize which types of advertisements are displayed for you within Facebook, you can open the respective page provided by Facebook and follow the instructions for setting up use-based advertising: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. These settings apply irrespective of platforms, i. e. they are applied for all devices, for instance desktop computers or mobile devices.
7. You may opt out of the use of cookies for reach measurement and promotional purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and additionally the US-website (http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or the European website (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/).
3.6 LinkedIn Conversion-Tracking

In addition, this information is used to show you specific and relevant offers and recommendations, after you have informed yourself on the website about certain services, information and offers.
