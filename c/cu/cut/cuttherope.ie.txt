Such information may be gathered by the following methods:
Tracking. Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

3. How Information Is Used, Shared and Disclosed.
ZeptoLab does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as ZeptoLab does not share information that may be collected from your child. ZeptoLab uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the ZeptoLab Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of ZeptoLab's business. Examples of how ZeptoLab shares and discloses your information is as follows:
Legal. ZeptoLab may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise ZeptoLab's legal rights. ZeptoLab may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when ZeptoLab believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ZeptoLab's rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. ZeptoLab may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ZeptoLab's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfers. As ZeptoLab continues to develop its business, ZeptoLab may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of ZeptoLab's assets are acquired or ZeptoLab merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that ZeptoLab reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, ZeptoLab will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control. ZeptoLab may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on ZeptoLab's behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. ZeptoLab will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. ZeptoLab shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.
4. Security.
The security of your Personal Information is important to ZeptoLab. ZeptoLab follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to ZeptoLab, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, ZeptoLab cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, ZeptoLab and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by ZeptoLab. For ZeptoLab, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by ZeptoLab is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology,"SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.
5. Advertising.
ZeptoLab may use ads and ad-relating features in the ZeptoLab Services. Such ads and ad-relating features may contain cookies that recognize your device each time you receive an online ad. This allows ad servers to compile information about your viewing and interaction with their ad and deliver targeted ads that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, and ZeptoLab encourages you to review the applicable advertiser's website for their privacy policy. If ZeptoLab uses pop-up ad windows irrelevant to the function of any of its games, you will be able to close the pop-up window.
ZeptoLab has third-party ads in free versions of its mobile applications and, provided that you are age 13 or older, ZeptoLab collects your Device ID and may pass it to advertisers to enable certain advertising. ZeptoLab does not store or otherwise save your Device ID.
6. Social Media Features and Tools.
The ZeptoLab Services may include integrated social media features and tools, such as the Facebook "Like" button, the YouTube "Share This" button, and interactive mini-programs that run in the ZeptoLab Services. These Features may collect information on your IP address, which page you are visiting on ZeptoLab's site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media features and tools are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on the ZeptoLab Services. Your interactions with these integrated social media features and tools are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
7. Google+ or Other OpenID Provider.
You may be able to log in to some of ZeptoLab's mobile applications using sign-in services such as Google+ or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with ZeptoLab such as your name and email address to pre-populate ZeptoLab's sign up form.Â  Services like Google+ give you the option to post information about your activities on the ZeptoLab website to your profile page to share with others within your network.
8. Links to Other Sites.
The ZeptoLab Services contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by ZeptoLab. Please be aware that ZeptoLab is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. ZeptoLab encourages you to be aware when you leave ZeptoLab's site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the ZeptoLab Services.
9. Access/Data Retention.
If you or your child's information changes, or if you no longer desire the ZeptoLab Services, you may make corrections and updates, delete inaccuracies, or request deletion or further contact with you or your child, by updating your account information or by contacting ZeptoLab at info@zeptolab.com. ZeptoLab will respond to your access request within 15 days.
ZeptoLab will retain you and your child's information for as long as you or your child's account is active, or as needed to provide services.

ZeptoLab will retain and use the information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
10. Special Notice REGARDING MINORS.
ZeptoLab does not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 13 without parental consent. ZeptoLab requires device owners to specify their age before any Personal Information is collected. If it comes to ZeptoLab's attention that Personal Information has been collected from a person under the age of 13, ZeptoLab will delete this information as quickly as possible.

ZeptoLab encourages you to periodically review this page for the latest information on its privacy practices. If ZeptoLab makes material changes to how Personal Information collected from children under age 13 is used, ZeptoLab will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent or, if ZeptoLab does not have such emails to contact parents directly, by reasonable means on ZeptoLab's website for the new uses of the child's Personal Information.
