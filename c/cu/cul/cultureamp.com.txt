We collect information relating to you and your use of our Services from a variety of sources. Some of this information is collected directly from you and some of this information is collected from your interaction with our Services, your Company, other individuals at your Company, or from third parties. How and what information we collect about you will depend on the way that you use our Services, for example, whether you are an Administrator, Respondent, an Individual Feedback User or Visitor.
(a) Information we generally collect

This information may include, for example, your name and email address.
Usage information: We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our Services. This may include which web pages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and other activities. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information about the cookies we use in our Services.
Device and browser data: We collect data from the device you use to access our Services, such as your IP address, operating system, browser details and time of visit. This information may also tell us your location.

This data includes usage details and user statistics. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information about cookies and page tags we use on our Websites.
Log data: We keep log files that record data each time a device accesses our servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including the originating IP address. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to maintain an audit trail of activity, to improve our Services, to improve our marketing activities, for system analytics, or to monitor or improve functionality.
Referral data:  If as a Visitor, you navigate to our Websites from an external source (such as a link on another website or via an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.

(b) I nformation specific to Administrators, Respondents and Individual Feedback User s
We may collect the following information about Administrators, Respondents or Individual Feedback Users:
Information collected from your Compan y :   The information that each Customer provides to us is different. In most cases, your company will provide us with demographic data such as your name, email information, and other information related to your role within the Company, including your manager, direct reports and your position within the Company’s organization chart. Some Customers may provide us with additional demographic information so they can better analyze and understand their survey results. In the event that you are, or you become, part of a Network, your Company may request that we create an account for you if you are not already an Individual Feedback User.
Single sign-ons : If you choose to register or login using a third party account (such as Google or your Company’s SSO provider), the authentication of your login details are handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link your Culture Amp account with the third party account. By using a Google Single Sign-On account (or other supported SSO), you are allowing us to access your Google (or other supported SSO) account information.
HRIS data: If the Customer uses a third-party human resource information system (for example, Workday or BambooHR) to import information into Services, we will also receive information from that third party (for example, your name, email address, employment and demographic data).
Survey responses : When you answer a Customer survey, we will store your survey answers and comments.
(c) Information specific to Individual Feedback Users
We may collect or share the following information about Individual Feedback Users:
Profile page information :  When an Administrator creates an account for you, we may collect the following information from your Company, your name, company name, email address, title and role within your Company, photograph, and other organizational information, such as the person you report to and your direct reports within the Company. When other individuals submit feedback about you, we will also use that information to create graphs or charts that will be displayed on your Personal Profile Page.
Individual feedback : You may be asked by your Company to provide feedback for other individuals employed by your Company and other individuals employed by your Company may be asked to provide feedback for you (in each case, a “ Performance Review ”). We may send you communications through the Services requesting that you provide a Performance Review about another employee in your Company. When you participate in providing Performance Reviews, other individuals or your Company may be able to review certain information about you, for example the content in the Performance Review. However, Continuous Feedback Messages will only be viewable by you and the person you are sharing Continuous Feedback Messages with.
Your content : When you use the Services as an Individual Feedback User, we will store any messages or content that you submit to us when you use this portion of the Services, such as when you exchange Individual Feedback with other individuals (including any messages, pictures, files and video) or submit Performance Reviews, as well as when these messages or files were sent.

We may collect the following information about Administrators:
Registration details: When you register an account or another Administrator creates an account for you, we collect your name, company name, email address, password and other information.
Survey data: When you create and launch surveys using the Services, we will store those survey questions and other information related to those surveys.
Billing details: If you use a credit card for billing, our credit card processor may collect information such as the cardholder’s name, billing address, email address, credit card number, expiry date and credit card security code.

(e) Information specific to users of ONA network analysis
We may collect the following information about users of ONA network analysis:
If your Company elects to use our ONA network analysis tool, when you first start using the Services and periodically thereafter, we will ask you to provide the authentication token for your company email address or the authentication token for your account on any instant messaging system that your Company uses for business communications and that we support (“ Supported Messaging System ”) (in each case, “ Authentication Token ”). You can choose not to participate.
Each time you (or another user) provides the Authentication Token for your (or their) company email address or the Supported Messaging System, we will use the Authentication Token to collect the last 90 days of email and calendar meta data (consisting of the To, From, cc, bcc, and Timestamp Fields which we refer to as “ Meta Data ”) from your (or their) company email address, or the Supported Messaging System.
Your Meta Data or the Meta Data collected from other individuals at your Company may also include communications made to and from third parties outside of your organization.
We will use your Meta Data to determine the users within your Company that you communicate with in order to create your Network. The Network is used to send requests for Individual Feedback to the users within your Network. If another user in your Company provides us with Meta Data, and you had communicated with them, it may include your Meta Data also.
If you do not want your Meta Data being used as described in this section, you must notify your Company to not enable ONA network analysis.
4. Who is the data controller or processor?
Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of information. For Administrators,  Respondents and Individual Feedback Users, your company, which is our Customer will generally be the controller of your personal information and Culture Amp will be the processor (unless indicated otherwise in this Privacy Policy). For Visitors, Culture Amp will generally be the controller of your personal information.
5. How do we hold the information we collect?
(a) Security of your personal information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. All your data is private and confidential and we take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We follow generally accepted security standards, to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Culture Amp is ISO27001 certified.
However, please note that transmitting information over the Internet is never completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is absolutely secure in all situations.
Security is a collaborative effort, so we also recommend that you create a sophisticated password for logging in to our services and keep that password secret.
If you suspect there has been any unauthorized access or misuse of your personal information, immediately contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@cultureamp.com.
If you have any concerns about the security of our platform, contact our Information Security Team at security@cultureamp.com.
(b) Where your personal information is located
Our servers are based in the United States, so your personal information will generally be processed and hosted in the United States. However, as some of our offices and service providers are located outside of the United States, there may be times when your personal information may be transferred, disclosed or processed in another country, such as Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, if you contact our Customer Success team for support or questions, any information you provide us in the support request (including personal information such as your name and email address) will be processed and hosted in Ireland by the service provider we use to manage support requests.
(c) European Union or Swiss users
If you live in the European Union, we will use the following safeguards to transfer your personal information to a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:
European Union Standard Contractual Clauses: Culture Amp offers the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses ( ** EU SCCs** ), also known as Model Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of information. We also use the EU SCCs when we transfer your personal information to a member of the Culture Amp Group located in a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law. A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating the EU SCCs, is available on request.

Examples of our service providers include: hosting services; project management software; email service providers; system monitoring services; customer support services; and website analytics. These companies are only authorized to use your personal information as necessary for us to provide our Services to you and/or the Customer.

However, there may be occasions where we need to disclose your personal information to our staff, service providers, professional advisors or other third parties, including to:
Provide the Services: In providing the Services, we may need to disclose your personal information to people who work for us or to one of our service providers. Our agreements with third parties include obligations to protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information. These disclosures may be related to activities such as filling orders, processing payments and mail-outs, storing and managing documents, research, providing professional advice, facilitating creation of accounts, sending you service emails, providing technical support, or providing other services to you. Transfers of Respondent and Individual Feedback User information to our service providers are covered by our agreement with the Customer.
Prevent illegality or enforce our terms and policies: If you engage in or threaten any unlawful activity, we may reasonably believe that it is necessary to disclose your personal information to the police, a relevant authority or enforcement body, or your internet service provider, employer, supervisor or network administrator.
Protect our rights or the rights of our staff: There may be situations where disclosing your personal information is necessary to protect the property, health or safety of Culture Amp or its staff, the Customers or others. For example, exchanging information with other organizations to protect against fraud.
Keep other entities associated with us informed: In some cases, we may need to disclose your personal information to our agents, business affiliates, joint venture entities, partners, investors or any applicable subsidiaries or holding companies. The need to disclose your personal information to these entities may arise from a legal obligation we owe that entity, or to assist our or their legitimate business interests.
Run events, competitions and promotions: We may need to disclose your personal information to sponsors and promoters when you register or attend an event or enter any competition that we conduct or promote. This disclosure will generally not apply to Respondents or Individual Feedback Users.
Perform actions you request or consent to: You may specifically authorize us to disclose your personal information to a third party. For example, to resolve a dispute regarding our Privacy Policy or to integrate a third-party service. We may also disclose your personal information to a third party with your prior consent.
Comply with legal requests: In some situations, we may be compelled to disclose your personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may disclose your personal information to third parties such as law enforcement officials or to comply with court orders, such as subpoenas or other legal processes.
Merge or sell our business:  We may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume and be subject to all the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If Culture Amp is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
When we disclose your personal information to third parties such as our service providers, we sign confidentiality and data processing agreements with them to ensure they maintain confidentiality and have privacy and security standards to protect your personal information.

(c) Disclosures specific to Respondents or Individual Feedback Users
When you use our Services as a Respondent or an Individual Feedback User, we may also disclose your personal information for the purposes of:
Providing the Services: When you answer Customer surveys, we will disclose that information to the Customer and Administrators. How your answers are displayed and what information may be used to analyze and report your answers (either in an aggregate or individual form) may vary from survey to survey. It is important that you read the Confidentiality Notice before answering a survey so you understand how your survey answers will be used and the ways they might be shared (if at all). Your survey data will also be visible to other employees in your Company each time you share your survey reports, or provide feedback to such employee. Your Company and other employees in your Company will not be able to see your Personal Profile Page, however, your personal information may be used to provide Services to other users in your Network.
Creating aggregated de-identified data: We may create aggregated de-identified data for any purpose derived from data we hold about you. For example, we may create aggregated de-identified data to share with customers, prospects, partners for business or research purposes, or for provision of our Services such as our survey benchmarks.
Fulfilling Customer requests: Because the Customer is the controller of your personal information, we hold and process your personal information on behalf of the Customer. There may be occasions when the Customer instructs us to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as a consultant or a new service provider. If instructed by the Customer to transfer your personal information to a third party, we will sign a data transfer agreement with the Customer and the third party if required, to ensure that they continue to observe the Confidentiality Notice for each survey.
Preventing harm: We may also disclose your personal information to the Customer or relevant authorities if your use of our Services indicates an imminent risk of harm to you or to others around you.
