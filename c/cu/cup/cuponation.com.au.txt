This confirmation email contains a link that you need to click on to confirm your subscription. This so-called double-opt-in-procedure helps us to ensure that the email-account holder has actually authorised the receipt of our newsletter.
5.2 Use of newsletter service providers
We use technical service providers which help us managing the newsletter subscriptions and providing related marketing services (“Newsletter Service Providers"). This includes service providers which may have their registered seat and servers in a state outside of the European Union e.g. in the USA. However, we exclusively work with companies that offer an appropriate data protection level in line with the stipulations of the GDPR. You can find further information relating to the sharing of data to third parties outside of the European Union under Section 11.4.

5.3 Newsletter-Tracking
We will track and evaluate your usage of our newsletter, such as email-opens and email-clicks, by means of a tracking technology made available by the Newsletter Service Provider. For this purpose the HTML-emails sent with our newsletter may contain web beacons (also called pixel tags, tracking pixel or GIFs), automatically embedded by our Newsletter Service Providers. A web beacon is a small graphic that contains unique identifiers that allow an analysis of the success or failure of our Newsletter campaigns. Our Service Provider records each subscribers email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click in order to provide us with aggregated reports about how an email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took.
As part of your registration, we may ask for your consent to tailor the content of our newsletter to your personal interests. This is done by evaluating the data about your interactions with our newsletter and your use of this Website. That means that the pseudonymous Usage Data, we collected about you in the past and we will collect in the future will be attributed to your email address. This single record helps us to understand your needs and preferences even better so that we can adjust the contents of the newsletter optimally to your personal interests and to provide you with relevant content.

This way the web beacons will not be able to work. You can also configure your browser settings in a way that no cookies are stored on your computer. Web beacons typically only work in conjunction with cookies. However, in these cases the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.
