Use of Google Analytics _
_
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO), Google Analytics uses a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.
The IP address submitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to its use of the online offer and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
The personal data of users will be deleted or anonymized after 12 months.
Here’s more information on Google Inc’s data usage: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en
Use of Google Fonts
We use Google Fonts of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) on our website. The use of Google Fonts is done without authentication and no cookies and the Google Fonts API are sent. Your Google Account information transmitted during your use of Google Fonts. Google only records the use of CSS and the fonts used and stores this data securely. More about these and other questions can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=231544625969.
What data Google collects and what data is read from https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
Use of Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Instagram plugins
Use of Facebook social plugins
This website uses social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are recognizable by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs up” sign) or are marked with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
When a user calls a web page of this site that contains such a plugin, its browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and incorporated by him into the website. The provider therefore has no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore informs users according to their level of knowledge:
By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example, press the “Like” button or leave a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored there.
If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him through this offer and associate it with his member data stored on Facebook, he must “Log out” on Facebook befire visiting the site.
It is also possible to block Facebook social plugins with add-ons for your browser, for example with the “Facebook Blocker“.
Google+
Google+ is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). For an overview of Google’s plugins and their look, see developers.google.com/+/web/
Twitter
This site uses the buttons of the Twitter service. These buttons are provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. They are recognizable by terms such as “Twitter” or “Follow”, associated with a  blue bird. With the help of the buttons it is possible to share a post or page of this site on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.
When a user calls up a web page of this web site containing such a button, its browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of Twitter. The content of the Twitter buttons is transmitted by Twitter directly to the user’s browser. The provider therefore has no influence on the extent of the data that Twitter collects with the help of this plugin and informs users according to their level of knowledge. After this, only the IP address of the user, the URL of each web page when the button is received, but not used for purposes other than the appearance of the button.
Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter at http://twitter.com/privacy.
Instagram
Instagram is operated by Instagram L LC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“Instagram”). An overview of the Instagram buttons and their appearance can be found here:

Youtube
This website uses the Privacy Plugin from Lyte. The Youtube videos are cached with a preview image not by YouTube servers but by the own server. That means, it will not connect to any YouTube servers before you click and confirm the play button. This allows embedding YouTube videos without sending data to Google/youtube with every page view. This plugin only connects to Youtube when the user actively clicks the play button. More information can be found here: https://github.com/michaelzangl/wp-video-embed-privacy/wiki/How-it-works
Starting the video could trigger further data processing. We have no influence on that. For more information about privacy at YouTube, please see their privacy policy at: http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube
