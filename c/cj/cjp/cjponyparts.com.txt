Private Browsing
Most browsers, like Chrome and Safari, offer you the ability to browse websites privately. In this mode, the browsers won't save your browsing history, cookies and site data, or information entered in forms. Downloaded files and bookmarks can still be kept but keep in mind that your activity isn't hidden from entities like your employer, school or internet service provider if you are on their network.
Here are specific instructions for the top browsers CJ's customers use to enable private browsing:
Chrome
Safari
Internet Explorer
Edge
For private viewing in other browsers, please consult your web browser's website for instructions. If none exist, please consider installing one of the browsers listed above.
Compliance
PCI Compliant
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance is designed to protect businesses and their customers against payment card theft and fraud. If a business accepts, stores or transmits card data, PCI DSS compliance validation is required by card brands such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. It consists of common sense steps that mirror best security practices. CJ Pony Parts is certified as PCI compliant through a third-party compliance validation solution.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We, therefore, will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
The General Data Protection Regulation creates consistent data protection rules across Europe and applies to companies based in the EU as well as global businesses who process personal data about individuals in the EU.
To highlight our commitment to data security and protection, let's review some key points regarding the GDPR:
Consent Notice: User consent regarding cookies and tracking must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an easily accessible way. When you are attempting to visit the website from a location in the EU, you will be greeted with an immediate notice regarding cookies and tracking. Action must be taken on this notice to view the website. Actions include viewing the website with cookies enabled or receiving information about viewing using your browser's private-viewing ability.
Consent Opt-Out: It must also be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it. This page has been updated with instructions on how to opt-out of targeted advertising.
Data Portability: GDPR introduces data portability - the right to receive the personal data concerning you. This page has been updated with instructions on how to request a copy of the data you have submitted to us in the past.
Right to be Forgotten: You have the right to contact us at myaccountdata@cjponyparts.com to request account information be deleted, assuming there are no in-process orders or payments where the information is necessary.
Data Retention: For EU user accounts that have not been accessed in 7 Years, CJ Pony Parts will delete the personal data pertaining to those accounts.
"When the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly." Personally identifiable information is not passed through Google AdWords, DoubleClick and Google Analytics as their contracts and policies prohibit information being passed to Google that could be recognized as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). For that reason, the "User and event data retention" settings within Google Analytics has been set to "Do not automatically expire".
Data Portability/Opt-Out Instructions
For users who reside in the EU and would like to receive a copy of the personal data that has been previously supplied to us, please make a request to myaccountdata@cjponyparts.com. For instructions on how to opt-out of targeted ads, please see the 'Opting Out of Targeted Ads' section in this document. To browse the website without your browser saving cookies or your history, please see the Private Browsing section of this page.
Disclosing Information to Outside Parties
As stated before - we do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies or protect ours or others rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.
Terms of Use
Please also visit our Terms of Use section that establishes the use, disclaimers and limitations of liability governing the use of our website.
