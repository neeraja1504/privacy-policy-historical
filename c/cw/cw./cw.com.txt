We’ll store your information for as long as we have to by law. If there’s no legal requirement, we’ll only store it for as long as we need it.
Sharing your personal information

We’ll release information if it’s reasonable for the purpose of protecting us against fraud, defending our rights or property, or to protect the interests of our customers.
If we’re reorganised or sold to another organisation, we may transfer any personal information we hold about you to that organisation.
We may need to transfer your information to other group companies or service providers in countries outside the EEA (European Economic Area). This may happen if our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.
We may also share your information with partner organisations we’ve chosen carefully, so they can contact you about their products and services if you’ve agreed to this.
Keeping your personal information secure
We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss or destruction.
If we have a contract with another organisation to provide a service on our behalf, we’ll make sure they have appropriate security measures and only process your information in the way we’ve authorised. These organisations won’t be entitled to use your personal information for their own purposes. If necessary, our security teams will check them to make sure they meet the security requirements we’ve set.
Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered – as this is the nature of the internet. We can’t accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that’s beyond our control.
Your privacy rights
You can write to us at any time to get a copy of the personal information we hold about you. You can do this by filling in this application form and sending it to the address on the form. There’s a charge of £10 to cover the cost of providing this information.
If you believe we’re holding inaccurate information about you, please contact our customer services team (through the ‘Contact Us’ page on our website) so we can correct it.
If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from us, please contact our customer services team and you’ll be ‘opted out’. (You can get in touch with customer services through the Contact Us page on our site.)
You can choose to opt out of all marketing communications or to opt out of marketing in one of several ways (such as email, text, phone or post).
