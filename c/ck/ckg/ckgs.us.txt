Indian Visa | India Visa Application | Visa for India from USA - CKGS USA
All personal information collected by CKGS for Indian Visa, OCI Card, PIO Card  and Renunciation of Indian citizenship (hereinafter referred to as ‘ Services ’) is governed by the laws applicable for the time being in force, the policy guidelines and directions of the Government of India, Embassy of India in the USA & use as per the contract with the Embassy of India. This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Declaration & Undertaking, Disclaimer, the relevant Document Checklist and Forms and the Terms & Conditions.  By accepting the Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to our Privacy Policy.
The website www.in.ckgs.us contains  the required information  in connection with the Services. The said website will be updated as per the instructions of the Embassy / Consulate and will change from time to time.
The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, CKGS considers the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.
We collect no personal information (PII) about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide this information to us. Submitting personally identifiable information through our website is voluntary, but by doing so, you are giving your permission to use the information for the stated purpose. Not providing certain information may result in our inability to provide you with a service you desire. If you choose to provide us with PII on a CKGS website, through such methods as completing a web form or sending us an email, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or Service you have requested or to respond to your message. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.
We do automatically collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (.com, .edu, etc.); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website (such as a search engine or referring page) from which you reached our site. We use the information we collect to count the number of visitors to the different pages on our site and to help us make our site more useful to applicants & visitors like you.
In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the CKGS websites and particularly on the website / web portals of the Government of India, Embassy of India and its Consulates General signed in USA, and or on websites such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the Web server of the third-party service provider.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.
Third-Party Websites and Applications:
We link to social networking and other kinds of third-party websites. We use social networking websites to interact with the foreign audiences and to engage in public diplomacy worldwide. Social networking websites are used to publicize Embassy events, and engage with members of the public. We also use web measurement and customization technologies to measure the number of visitors to our websites and their various sections and to help make our websites more useful to visitors. In some cases, the third-party application may request an email address, username, password, and geographic location for account registration purposes. We do not use third-party websites to solicit and collect PII from individuals. We do not collect or store any PII collected by any third-party website, and no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside CKGS, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute.
We may use various types of online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors.  Primarily, CKGS uses this for checking results of Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) online survey on an ongoing basis to obtain feedback and data on visitor satisfaction with our websites. This survey does not collect PII. Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors, it is optional. If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources at our site as those who do take the survey. The survey reports are available only to web managers and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. We may use other limited-time surveys for specific purposes, which are explained at the time they are posted.
