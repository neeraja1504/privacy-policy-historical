What information do we collect?
Currently, Crunch.com gathers information (such as name, e-mail address and zip code) strictly for contact purposes when users opt to fill out an e-mail submission form to inquire about our company and about membership. In some cases we ask for other optional information including additional contact information and certain demographic information (such as phone number and gender).
How do we use your information?
We may use your information to communicate special offers, promotions and information about our company to you via email. If you do not wish to receive these emails you will have the option to opt out of future mailings (see the section below). We may also use your information to compile usage statistics and other data regarding the use of the Web site services. We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, outside of the limited circumstances referenced in the paragraph immediately below. We may, however, share with partnerâ€™s aggregated statistical data that includes users' demographic information but does not identify them. We reserve the right to provide any and all such aggregated and non-individually identifiable data to third parties.
How do we use your email information?
At Crunch we respect your concerns about privacy. We collect email information to provide a more personalized and relevant experience. If you give us your email address on the home page, when you inquire about membership or sign up, we will send you emails about exclusive offers, news at Crunch and new club openings. If you have previously opted out of receiving emails from us, providing updated information will act as an 'opt back-in'. If you want to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, simply click on the unsubscribe link located on the bottom of all of our emails. Although we strive to update our email list as frequently as possible, you might receive another contact before we are able to remove you. Please note that you will continue to receive Member Services related communications as it pertains to your member account. Crunch may use any of your contact information held on file (including Email, Mailing, Phone & Fax) to communicate with you in relation to day to day administrative activities, such as freeze requests, online purchases and important service alerts. Crunch never sells or rents your name, e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information to third-parties.
We only share user information in the ways described below:
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We will disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for tracking purposes, to charge your credit card (or process your check or money order, as appropriate), fill your order, improve the functionality of our site, perform statistical and data analyses, deliver your order and deliver promotional emails to you from us, removing repetitive information from customer lists, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. For example, we must release your credit card number to confirm payment; and release your mailing address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
