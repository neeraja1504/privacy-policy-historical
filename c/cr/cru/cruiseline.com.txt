Privacy Policy - Cruiseline.com
We built Cruiseline.com to help cruisers share and read cruise reviews as well as get together and share their experiences. To do that, we collect personal information about you. We understand this personal information is YOURS. As such, we give you control over your personal information. Cruiseline.com helps you share information with other cruisers and make new friends. You choose what information to put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures and interests. At any time, you can modify all of this through your Settings page.
This Privacy Policy describes how we use and protect your personal information. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Service during registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on December 5, 2012.
What Information Do We Collect?
You can browse and read most of the content cruiseline.com without telling us who you are. In order to use the interactive features, including joining a cruise roll call, posting a cruise review or participating in the forums, you are required to register. If you choose to give us personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. We may collect and store the following personal information:
email address, physical contact information, gender;
general information about you such as full name, date of birth, relationship status, interests and hobbies;
information based on your activities on Cruiseline.com (such as your cruises, reviews or posts to the discussion forum);
community discussions, dispute resolution, correspondence sent to us; and
standard web log information, such as connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our site, ad data, and IP address
How Secure Is The Information We Collect?
Your information is stored on our web host's servers located in the United States. Cruiseline.com is committed to industry best practices concerning security to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our possession. However, as you know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
How Do We Use Your Information?
The personal information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service. We will only share this information with companies or individuals outside of Cruiseline.com under the following limited circumstances:
We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Cruiseline.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Cruiseline.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users interested in scuba diving on a particular cruise, for example. Such information does not identify you individually.
