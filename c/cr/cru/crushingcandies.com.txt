Your account is shielded by password which is encrypted in our database; meanwhile, the “Forgot Password” function ensures that we cannot gain access to your password. However, in cases of posts or comments which incorporate links to third party websites with varying privacy policies, CrushingCandies are not accountable for that and have no power on them; therefore, users are required to carefully go through the privacy policies of the web-sites they pay visit to.
Data from individuals under the age of 13 are not retained; if posting by a person of that age comes to the awareness of CrushingCandies, all the necessary measures will be taken in order for these posts to be cleaned out and for the account to be switched off.
Gathering Data

We may also collect personal information in case you contact us, send us remarks or feedback, or publish it on our forum.
Still, in order to further ensure the safety of your personal data, you have to be careful not to post any personal information through comments. Also, note that we keep track of your IP address in our database each time you leave a comment to deal with spam issues. In addition, apart from your IP address, other standard web log entries are collected, such as page URL or timestamp, to make it possible for us to detect problems with our server, administer our site and come up with proper assistance to you.
Storing Data
