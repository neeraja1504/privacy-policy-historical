Privacy Policy - Critical Mention - Media Monitoring
Critical Mention’s commitment to maintaining your privacy
At Critical Mention we take your privacy seriously and we are committed to protecting the personal information that you choose to share with us. This information is gathered at registration, during your use of the service or otherwise in oral and written communications. We understand the importance of maintaining your trust and confidence in Critical Mention and we shall ensure that the personal information you submit to us remains private, and is used solely for the purposes set out in this policy.
Information about users generally
Critical Mention gathers information about all our users collectively, such as what area users visit most frequently and what information users access the most. We use this data anonymously in connection with the royalties payable to our content licensors. This information also helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall service for you. We may share this anonymous information with our business partners but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Critical Mention customers use our services. This aggregate information is never shared so that individual users or subscribers can be personally identified and it does not involve the transfer of any personal data we hold about you.
Information about users specifically
When you register to use this Critical Mention service we require certain personal information about you, such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. This information may also be submitted to Critical Mention in written form or via the telephone. In addition to tracking individual usage and marketing as described below, Critical Mention uses this personal information in several ways:
to enable Critical Mention to process, validate and verify subscriptions
to deliver the appropriate Critical Mention service to you
to assess and improve our services to you and to keep you informed about updates
to advise you on your use of the Critical Mention services
to invoice and collect payment from individual subscribers
Tracking Individual Usage
In certain circumstances, your usage of this Critical Mention service and the information that you have retrieved may be reported to your employer or the subscriber who pays for you to access the service. You were notified of this at registration and/or before your first use of the service. In such cases, this personal usage data will only be transferred to the subscribing party that pays for your access to this service. This is done to provide the subscriber with information as to how the service is being used within its organization and for its internal billing and costing purposes.
Marketing of other Critical Mention Services
If you give us permission, we may use your personal information to make you aware of additional Critical Mention services that may be of interest to you. We may also ask you for additional information, to be provided at your discretion, in an effort to deliver to you the best possible service experience. Critical Mention provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply select the Preferences area and under General Registration select the opt-out box.
Storage of your Personal Information by Critical Mention
The personal information that you provide to Critical Mention is held on our secure servers. We retain this information for so long as you are registered with us and for a reasonable period thereafter to close your account. This information will be shared within the Critical Mention group of companies only. Except as described above, we will not knowingly disclose any of this personal data or information about use of the Critical Mention services to outside parties (other than our sub-contractors if required), except when you expressly consent or we believe the law requires it.
Updating Account Information
You have the right to ask Critical Mention at any time for a copy of your personal information that we hold. This information shall be provided on payment of an administration fee. Critical Mention allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time. To do so, simply select the Preferences area, and under General Registration and you will find opportunity for editing the information you have submitted. Alternatively you can write to us at the appropriate address specified below.
