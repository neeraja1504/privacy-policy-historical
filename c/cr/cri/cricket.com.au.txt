Schedule 1 - AUSTRALIAN CRICKET PRIVACY POLICY
Australian Cricket Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to Cricket Australia (ABN 53 006 089 130) and each of the Australian Cricket Entities listed under “Australian Cricket Entities” below, which includes the Australian State and Territory Cricket Associations and the Big Bash League Clubs. Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricket Entities respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
Cricket Australia may disclose your personal information to the Australian Cricket Entities and the Australian Cricket Entities may disclose your personal information to Cricket Australia. Each organisation will collect and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
In this Privacy Policy, a reference to “Australian Cricket” means a reference to Cricket Australia and Australian Cricket Entities collectively.
When used in this policy, depending on the context, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Cricket Australia and/or the Australian Cricket Entities.
This policy provides information about how Australian Cricket may collect, hold and use your personal information.
If you do not provide us with the information that we request, then we may not be able to provide you with our products and services.
What is personal information?
Personal information is information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in material form or not, about an individual whose identity is reasonably apparent, or can be reasonably acscertained, from the information or opinion. Examples of personal information include your name, postal address, telephone number and email address.
We collect personal information to properly and efficiently carry out our respective functions, including to provide you requested products and services, and to facilitate the provision of marketing and promotion services that may be of interest to you.
The personal information collected and held about you will vary depending on the circumstances of collection and may include, but is not limited to, as follows:
your name, address, email address, date of birth, gender, occupation, contact information
information about your favourite BBL club or International team;
information about dealings with Cricket Australia or Australian Cricket Entities, including subscriptions for Australian Cricket services, attendance at cricket matches or use of your ACF, BBL club or venue membership;
details of cricket programs you have participated in and the organisations you have participated with;
details of items ordered or purchased from us;
background checks including police checks and working with children checked if you apply for employment, coaching and volunteer positions in Australian Cricket;
other information provided voluntarily by you, for example in response to surveys or competitions
How do we collect your personal information?
We collect personal information about you in a number of ways, including:
directly from you, for example, when you provide information to us by phone, email, in an application form or competition entry form, when you join a Cricket Australia or an Australian Cricket Entity fan club (including without limitation the Australian Cricket Family or the Aussie Cricket Crew or BBL membership), when you purchase tickets to an event, submit information through or access our websites or games (including without limitation cricket.com.au, cricketaustralia.com.au, bigbash.com.au, mycricket.cricket.com.au and the BBL Club websites and BBL Fantasy) or through Cricket Australia Live: The Official App; and
from third parties, such as the Australian Cricket Entities, Cricket Australia, ticket agencies, Cricket Australia or Australian Cricket commercial partners and other commercial data sources and data providers. We may collect personal information regarding a child from the parent or other responsible person associated with that child.\
We may also receive information about you from third parties in relation to other websites. For example, you may choose to participate in a third party application or feature as part of our services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or Google+ or otherwise linking to the services from another website or interactive service) or on a third party website or service (such as a Facebook application or a similar application or feature) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information.
When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on Australian Cricket services with that third party website or service, which may then collect information about your visits to Australian Cricket websites and may publish that activity as you request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find on an Australian Cricket website with your "connections" on the third party's website or service).
The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party's website or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.
Providing information
If you do not provide some or all of the information that we requests from you, this may affect our ability to communicate with you or provide the requested products or services.
By not providing requested information, you may jeopardise your ability to participate in programs or competitions or apply for employment or volunteer positions with us. If it is impracticable for us to deal with you as a result of you not providing the requested information or consent, we may refuse to do so.
Information storage and protection
