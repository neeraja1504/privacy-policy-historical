Information PublicEngines Gathers and Tracks. PublicEngines collects two kinds of information about visitors:
a. Personal Information. When you register for an account, voluntarily provide health information, request a service or information, place an order, submit feedback, post information onto your public profile, or participate in a forum or survey, we may need to ask you for personal information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, along with other information you may wish to provide for effective use of the PublicEngines Services (' User Information ').
b. Non-Identifying Information. We may also collect certain indirect and/or aggregate information as a result of your use of, and interaction with, the PublicEngines Services (' Usage Information '). We may also use certain standard web measurement and tracking technologies such as 'cookies,' web server logs, or other statistics programs to collect Usage Information and track and record how you use the PublicEngines Services. This data is anonymous and does not personally identify you. Usage Information helps us measure the success of the PublicEngines Services and its features or pages and to improve your online experience. Your browser may have an option that allows you to accept cookies, reject cookies, or receive notification when a cookie is sent, but you should note that the use of such restrictive browser settings may limit your use or the convenience of the PublicEngines Services. We do not use spyware, adware or any other similarly intrusive software. We may create anonymous Information records from User Information by excluding information (such as your name and email address) that make the data personally identifiable to you (' Anonymous Information '). PublicEngines reserves the right to use and disclose Usage Information and Anonymous Information to third parties in its sole discretion. Collectively, Usage Information, Anonymous Information and User Information are referred to in this Privacy Policy as ' Information.'
c. Tip Service. For PublicEngines' anonymous tip submission services, PublicEngines uses industry standard encryption and delivery routines to provide security and anonymity of the information being submitted. Unless you expressly provide it, no identifying information is collected or recorded by PublicEngines through this online submission transaction.
