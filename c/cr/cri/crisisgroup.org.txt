Cookies
Like most websites, our Website may place a “cookie” – a small text file – in the browser of your computer.  This cookie will assign you a unique number that allows us to save your information so that the information does not need to be re-entered.  Cookies can be either “persistent” or “session” based.  Our Website uses both types of cookies.
Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date (by default the cookies expire after 23 days), and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing website or component (such as plugins or embedded media, e.g., a YouTube video embedded on our website).  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser’s “Help” menu.
Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you quit your browser.
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. Instructions on how to do so will vary from browser to browser but you can find out more at www.aboutcookies.org. Some features and functionality may be lost if you choose to disable cookies.  Also, remember that you will have to adjust the cookie settings for each browser and device and you use to visit our Website.
Our Website may contain links to other sites that may use cookie technology. We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies.
Security
We use reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information and to store it securely.  Our Website has a secure SSL certificate, a global standard security technology that enables encrypted communication between the web browser and the web server.
If you choose to make an electronic donation to Crisis Group, you will be transferred to Stripe’s secured form, where the donation process will be completed.  Please refer to section 1.1 above for further information concerning the electronic donations process.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your Personal Information, but cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk.

The accuracy of your Personal Information is important to us. If you change your email address or would like to change your email preferences,  you may do so by clicking “update your preferences” at the bottom of each of our email updates to which you have subscribed.
