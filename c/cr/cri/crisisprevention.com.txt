We only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.
Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the personal information you provide on this site will not be shared with any third parties, although CPI reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission. In addition, CPI reserves the right to disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary.

All learners will have the ability to obtain a copy of their learner record. Learners may request a copy of their record by completing and signing an authorization/disclosure of form.
