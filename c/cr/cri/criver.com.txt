III. What Information We Collect
Information You Give Us
We collect your personal data (such as your professional information, contact information, payment information, sales information, and tradeshow related information) when you choose to submit it to us on our website, and we use it for those purposes which you approved. We may combine this data with other information to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information to help us improve our products and services.
Automatically Collected Information
We automatically collect certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our websites and in some e-mails that we send to you. Automatic technologies we use include, for example, web server logs, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, cookies, web beacons and third-party tools.
Web Server Logs : A web server log is a log file of activities performed that is created and maintained by a server.
IP Address : An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet that allows computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other.
Cookies : A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your computer when you access certain websites. The cookie uniquely identifies your browser to the server. Cookies allow us to store information on the server to help customize your web experience and to conduct website analysis and performance reviews. We use session and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during one session and disappear when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
Web Beacons : On certain web pages or e-mails, we may utilize a common Internet technology called a "web beacon" (also known as an "action tag" or "clear GIF technology"). Web beacons help us analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring, for example, the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.
Third-Party Tools : Third party tools (such as Google Analytics) use cookies to collect information about the use of websites, pages visited, frequency of visits, and how individuals found the site.

We will use personal data submitted to us, in conjunction with such automatically collected information (as described under “Automatically Collected Information” below), to improve our website operation by monitoring user patterns and preferences.
We also use depersonalized, aggregated information collected from our websites to help us understand trends and customer needs, and we may use that analysis of aggregated data internally or share it with our affiliates.

V. Retention
Cookies that are created may be kept up to 20 years from the time of creation. Market investigations, market research data, and surveys are kept for 10 years. Sales analysis data is kept for 7 years.
We use multiple databases to record and retrieve information sent to us through web forms (such as contact information, products and services requested, and billing/payment information). This information is kept for as long as needed to fulfill specific business purposes or purposes for which it was collected.
For all other data, a fixed retention period is not possible to determine. Instead we review data for retention based on the following: the purpose of the information; if the information could be reasonably gathered from another source; levels of risk, cost, and liability involved with keeping the information; if the information is still relevant for the original purpose; and the accuracy of the information.
In some cases, laws or regulations that apply to our business may require us to keep information longer than needed for a specific business purpose.

We take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard any information you provide to us from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. To this effect, our server log files are stored in a secure location and can only be accessed by our authorized employees. Although we take commercially reasonable steps, no system can ever by completely secure or error-free. In addition, it is your responsibility to safeguard any user names, passwords, or information associated with your account.
