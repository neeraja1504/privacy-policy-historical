The administration charge is kept to a minimum to cover costs only. In the event of a cancelled order by the client, or the client changing supplier the administration fee will not be returned by Creditplus.
Cars supplied by Creditplus will be covered by a car warranty for a minimum of 3 months. It is the customer's responsibility to be fully aware of the parts not covered by the car warranty (if any). The car is supplied on the basis that the client understands Creditplus will not rectify or compensate for any car repairs outside of the car warranty.
If a car is returned the customer bears the cost of return and a cancellation fee of 5% of the car value or a minimum of £500, whichever is the greater.
The Creditplus Vehicle Standards Guideline can be viewed here.
On delivery of a vehicle supplied by Creditplus you must inspect it and sign for its acceptance. If you allow another individual to do this, it will be taken that they are acting fully on your behalf and that you personally have accepted the vehicle. If you require a test drive of the vehicle, you need to notify the driver who will allow you to do so.
Creditplus will allow a 7 day notice period from delivery, for notification of any mechanical or body defects providing they are not commensurate with the vehicle age and mileage or notified to you before delivery. Cancellation after accepting the vehicle will only be allowed provided the goods are deemed faulty and that Creditplus cannot repair such items within 30 days. The cancellation fee does not apply if the vehicle order is cancelled under these terms. No other rights of cancellation apply or will be accepted. Order pricing is valid for 14 days. If you are purchasing the vehicle using finance you need to refer to the lenders terms and conditions.
All New & Pre-registered cars supplied by Creditplus will be covered by the relevant Manufacturers warranty. Where a vehicle is Pre-registered the balance of manufacturer’s warranty shall apply with no additional warranties being supplied by Creditplus. It is the customer’s responsibility to be fully aware of the parts not covered by the manufacturer’s car warranty (if any). All New & Pre-registered cars are supplied on the basis that the client understands Creditplus will not rectify or compensate for any car repairs outside of the car warranty.
If a New or Pre-registered car is returned the customer bears the cost of return along with a cancellation fee of 10% of the car value or a minimum of £1000, whichever is the greater.
Car Finance is provided, subject to status. Written quotations are available on request. To apply you must be at least 18 years old and a UK resident (excluding Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).
