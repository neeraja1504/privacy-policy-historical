Managing Your Online and Mobile Preferences
You are not required to provide Personal Information to browse our websites. If you provide us
with Personal Information to obtain a product or service from us, our Privacy Policy governs how
we share Personal Information with our affiliates and third parties.
As you access our online services, cookies and similar technologies allow us to customize
content and advertisements for our products and services on our websites or mobile apps. In
order to make content and advertising as relevant as possible, we may use information about
your relationship with us (such as types of accounts and transactional information). Using
cookies can give you additional or easier access to certain features on our website (such as
allowing you to sign in easier), and can allow us to provide you with more personalized offers.
Currently, our website does not respond to browser "do not track" signals. You can set your
browser to not accept cookies or to indicate when cookies are sent.
Some mobile devices come with a non-permanent advertising identifier or ID which gives
companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. In many cases, you can
turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within
your mobile device privacy settings. You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your
mobile device. By turning off ad tracking or location tracking on your mobile device, you may still
see the same number of ads as before, but they may be less relevant because they will not be
based on your interests.
Behavioral Advertising on Third Party Sites
Certain Credit One partners may use unique cookies to collect Online Activity Data on our
website or mobile apps to advertise on third party websites Credit One products and services
that may be of interest to you. Our partners are subject to their own privacy policies. To explore
options for opting out of behavioral advertising, visit aboutads.info/choices or click on the
AdChoices icon in an ad and follow the instructions. You may also use the Network Advertising
Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool found at networkadvertising.org/choices, or other tools provided
by the publishing platform. Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on
your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change
web browsers, you may need to opt out again. Additionally, we may partner with websites like
Google and Yahoo to display ads to you based on search terms you use on those websites.
Please review the privacy policies of those websites for instructions on how to limit these ads.
Please note that you may still receive general online advertising from Credit One even after you
adjust your ad preferences with certain web search engines or opt out of online advertising
through AdChoices or the NAI tool. Such advertising, however, will not be based on Online
Activity Data or search term information.
Email
Our marketing emails include instructions on how to opt out of receiving such emails in the
future.
