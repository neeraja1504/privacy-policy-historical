INFORMATION WE SHARE

We permit our service providers to use personal information as needed to deliver services or comply with applicable laws and regulations. Cree enters into a contract with third-parties prior to sharing Personal Data to obtain assurances that the Agent will safeguard Personal Data consistent with Cree’s obligations.

We will share personal information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business assets, such as during a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or bankruptcy.

YOUR CHOICES AND ACCESS
You may visit and browse our Site without providing any personal information, and you can always choose not to provide us with the personal information we request.

If you would like to change any information you submitted to us, or if you want to opt-out of receiving future communications from us, please contact us. Upon request, when Cree acts as a Controller, as defined by global privacy regulations, Cree will provide individuals with reasonable access to their Personal Data to allow individuals the opportunity to correct, amend or delete Personal Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed without your consent. A request may be denied under certain circumstances, such as where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. When Cree is a processor, as defined by global privacy regulations, and not a Controller, it will take reasonable steps to help the appropriate Controller respond and will act on the reasonable direction of the Controller’s customers with respect to access.
