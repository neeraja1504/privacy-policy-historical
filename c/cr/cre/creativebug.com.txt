You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information in the United States with our third party service providers.
Our partners and third-party independent contractors are bound under contract not to use or share your personal information for unauthorized purposes.

We reserve the right to share some or all of your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other companies in the United States under the common control of Jo-Ann (collectively, “Affiliates”), for the purposes described in this policy. We will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information, we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with laws or to respond to subpoenas or other judicial orders served on us, (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Creativebug, Affiliates or third parties; (c) to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use of our web site and this Privacy Policy; (d) to prevent imminent harm; or (e) if we find that your actions on our web site violate any laws, or any of our usage guidelines.
To provide offers that are of interest to you, we may allow other companies to place advertisements and other technology on our web site.

6. Advertising
We use “interest-based” advertisements, also known as “online behavioral advertising.” Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior. We may share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct advertising campaigns for us. Third parties and their affiliates collect certain information as a result of their “tags” being on our website. The information that they collect includes the name (URL) of the web pages you view while on our site, your IP address, time of visit, information about your browser software, information about your device, and randomly-assigned identifiers stored in Cookies, which they use to target and serve advertising to you. We will use all this information to serve advertising to you.
In connection with online behavioral advertising, some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, and they may then display advertisements on those additional devices.
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third parties as defined by the initiative. For more information, visit http://www.w3.org/. As explained below, some web sites, including our web site, will ignore a “do-not-track” signal.
As required by Section 22575 of the California Business and Professions Code, the following disclosure is made to California residents and to residents of other states: Our web site does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser. As described in Section 3, “How We Collect Personal Information,” we use Cookies and other tools to collect information about you when you visit our web site to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products, services, stores, and web site. After you leave our web site, we do not track your online activity on other web sites, but third parties (and their affiliates) may track your online activity to offer you advertisements.
You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser. As explained in section 11, we do not represent or warrant that the actions taken on other web sites will be effective.
For mobile devices and applications, you can visit the following website to opt-out of behavioral advertising: http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. As explained in section 11, we do not represent or warrant that the actions taken on other web sites will be effective.
As an alternative to the DAA opt-out, you can also elect to block all Cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and Cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you can block both first-party and third-party cookies by selecting those options at Tools/Internet Options/Privacy/Settings-Advanced/Override Automatic Cookie Handling. Also, if you are using Firefox 25, you can “uncheck” Accept All Cookies under Firefox Preferences/Privacy-Use Custom Settings For History/Accept Cookies from Sites. If you block Cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. We do not represent or warrant that these actions will be effective to accomplish their purpose.
We may use a third party service provider to manage our product review system. When you submit product reviews on our website, our third party service provider may place Cookies on your browser and offer advertising to you. For more information on how this provider uses your information, please visit this link: http://go.bazaarvoice.com/848PGD1740001EG001ipQ00

Our website includes social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.
