No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information
Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites, unless purposely placed in your Profile at Cre8asiteForums.com.
No personal information is collected. Ever. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, such as our advertisers, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
Cre8pc.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of participants in its various programs, affiliate links, or any off-site URL. Please refer to our Terms and Conditions.
Reciprocal Links
It is our policy to not link to "link farm" pages. Automated link requests are not accepted or reciprocated. We do not exchange links or entertain link requests of any type.
