Privacy Statement | Creativepool
. . .
Overview
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and personalised experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose.
Our services connect people across the globe to allow for a fully interactive network within the Creative industry. As a result your interactions with other members / companies on Creativepool are public by default, along with some of your personal information, such as your name.
This Privacy Policy describes to you how and when we will collect, use and share your information. When using any of our services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This will include any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable laws. Throughout this Privacy Policy, the terms “we” or “us” refer to Creativepool Ltd (company reg 05707888). Creativepool Ltd is the “Controller” and “Processor” of your information under current data law.
As a website we are constantly improving our services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data. Our services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, you will be notified either through your account or sent an email, or both. We will update the changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If you have questions or concerns about Creativepool’s Privacy Policy, please feel free to email Support https://creativepool.com/contactus.php
Information about Creativepool Visitors

This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. If we do share this information with third parties it will only be in the aggregate, so that our external partners may understand how Creativepool users, collectively, use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you too.

We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
Information you have shared with others will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our services.

Children
Our services are not available to children and we ask that persons under the age of 18 do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under 18 years old, you cannot use this site.

Our services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
When you share an article or a post publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere. Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
