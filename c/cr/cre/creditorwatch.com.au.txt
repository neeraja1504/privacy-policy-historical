All Data, including personal and non-personal information, that is entered into the Service by You, or automatically imported on Your instruction, is transferred to CreditorWatch’s servers as a function of transmission across the Internet. By using the Service, You consent to Your personal information being transferred to our servers as set out in this Policy.
Currently our servers are located in Australia, primarily by Global Switch Pty Ltd. ( Global Switch ), and Your personal information will be routed through, and stored on, those servers as part of the Service. Global Switch complies with relevant aspects of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and has certified that it adheres to relevant Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. If the location of our servers change in the future, we will update this Policy. You should review our Policy regularly to keep informed of any updates.
By providing Your personal information to CreditorWatch, You consent to CreditorWatch storing Your personal information on servers hosted in Australia. While Your personal information will be stored on servers located in the Australia, it will remain within CreditorWatch’s effective control at all times. The server host’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to CreditorWatch, and we’ve taken steps to ensure that our server hosts do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, Your personal information.
CreditorWatch takes steps to protect your personal information
CreditorWatch is committed to protecting the security of Your personal information and we take all reasonable precautions to protect it from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Your personal information is stored on secure servers that have SSL Certificates issued with an A+ security rating, and all Data transferred between You and the Service is encrypted.
However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your information will be secure at all times. Transmission of personal information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only enter, or instruct the entering of, personal information to the Service within a secure environment.
We will advise You at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of a security breach where Your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorised persons or in any unauthorised manner.
CreditorWatch only discloses Your Personal Information in limited circumstances
CreditorWatch will only disclose the personal information You have provided to us to entities outside the CreditorWatch group of companies if it is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your personal information was collected pursuant to this Policy, including the provision of the Service.
CreditorWatch will not otherwise disclose Your personal information to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However, You should be aware that CreditorWatch may be required to disclose Your personal information without Your consent in order to comply with any court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process or investigation including by tax authorities, if such disclosure is required by law. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You if we are required by law to disclose Your personal information.
The third parties who host our servers do not control, and are not permitted to access or use Your personal information except for the limited purpose of storing the information. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users of the Service, CreditorWatch does not currently “disclose” personal information to third parties located overseas.
CreditorWatch does not store Your credit card details
If you choose to pay for the Service by credit card, Your credit card details are not stored by the Service and cannot be accessed by CreditorWatch staff.

CreditorWatch will process Your request as soon as reasonably practicable, provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so on legal grounds. If we are unable to meet Your request, we will let you know why. For example, it may be necessary for us to deny Your request if it would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy or affairs of other individuals, or if it is not reasonable and practicable for us to process Your request in the manner You have requested. In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to seek to arrange access to Your personal information through a mutually agreed intermediary (for example, the Subscriber).
We’ll only keep Your personal information for as long as we require it for the purposes of providing You with the Service. However, we may also be required to keep some of Your personal information for specified periods of time, for example under certain laws relating to corporations, money laundering, and financial reporting legislation.
