INFORMATION CREATIVE NOVELS COLLECTS
We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services.
We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which content you like the most. The information Creative Novels collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
When you’re not signed in to a Creative Novels Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintaining your language preferences across browsing sessions.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Creative Novels Account, which we treat as personal information - information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Creative Novels, such as information we associate with your Creative Novels Account.
THINGS YOU CREATE OR PROVIDE TO US
When you create a Creative Novels Account, you provide us with personal information that includes a name and a password. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Creative Novels Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to comment or receive updates on the content we provide.
We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like emails and comments you write and receive, photos and videos you save, and novels you write.
Your Comments
Additionally, when visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help with spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

WHY CREATIVE NOVELS COLLECTS DATA
We use it to build a better platform and service
We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Debugging. If there is an issue with the platform, understanding the location (for Content Delivery Network/ Cache issues) and device and browser you are using become essential.
Security. If there is a person, app, site, or program that intends to do the platform harm, one of the ways of blocking such an entity is first to block the IP Address they use.
Maintain and Improve our Services. Other than debugging, there is the need to gauge how users react to certain events, layouts, and structures we build. From this, we aim to improve to produce a more favorable platform for Creative Novels Users.
Develop New Services.
Provide Personalized Services, Including Content and Ads.
We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.
Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google or any of our other Ad Partners.
* We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
* We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email.
Measure Performance. We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.
Communicate With You. We use the information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Creative Novels Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Creative Novels, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Creative Novels, Our Users, and The Public. We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.
Creative Novels will make your display pictures, reading-lists, follows, and display name public. Personal Identifiable information such as emails, IP Addresses, and names will not be shared.
We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
