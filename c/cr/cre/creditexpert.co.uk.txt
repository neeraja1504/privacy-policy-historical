How we use your information
We use your personal information in a number of ways to fulfil your request and make our products and services as effective as possible.
To enable you to access our website and use our services
We will use your information to accept you as a new/returning customer and continue to provide you with our products and services.
To let you know about significant changes to our products, terms or privacy policy
We'll let you know by email, SMS, push notification or when you log in to the site if there are significant changes to our products or their features which change how we process your personal data.
To confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide
As part of providing services to you we will confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide for security purposes.
Establishing your identity is important as the services may provide you with your personal credit information (such as your credit score or credit report) and we must be sure you are who you say you are. Identity checking may also involve checking the registration information you give us against information we already hold about you as a credit reference agency and potentially publicly available information about you such as from social media.
If we are unable to confirm your identity from the registration information you provide, we will let you know by using the contact details you have provided and you may then have the option to make a written application and provide further proof of your identity.
To process payments and collect arrears
We will use your information to process the payments you commit to when signing up to our services and for the collection of any future payments or overdue amounts for those services.
Your payment card provider may let us know if the card details relating to your Experian payment change. If this happens, we reserve the right to update certain card details to make sure your access to our services isn't interrupted.
So for example, if you get a new payment card with a later expiry date to the one you currently pay with (but all the other details stay the same), we may update your payment card expiry date accordingly.
To provide and improve customer support
We will use your information to be able to provide and improve the customer support we provide to you (e.g. when you have questions or when you forget your log-in information).
To provide alerts
We will use your information to send you alerts where 'Alerts' are part of the service you ask us to provide e.g.
* web-monitoring when we find your personal details are available to others online.
* where there are certain changes to your credit report.
To send you service communications
We will use your information to contact you to tell you about changes to or issues affecting the services you are taking.
To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings
When you use our comparison service to search for products, the information you provide is used to retrieve information about products relevant to your search and create a table which allows you to compare them.
Where eligibility ratings are available, the information you provide (including personal information such as your name and address) and your current and historical credit information from Experian (and sometimes TransUnion and Equifax) is also used to help you understand whether you are likely to be accepted based on the lender's criteria.
In some circumstances, we will share that information with brokers, aggregators, insurers, lenders and providers of credit, insurance and other financial products themselves (as described in the section "Who we share your personal information with").
To provide information related to your use of our comparison services
When you search for products, we may contact you by email or SMS to confirm activity relating to use of our comparison services, such as details of the searches you have made, results that you have seen when searching, or information about introductions you've requested to brokers and lenders.

We will use this to check your eligibility for third party products or services based on lenders' criteria, and notify you of credit opportunities, products and services that you may be eligible for. You can find more information around how we check your eligibility in the above section 'To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings'.

* when you interact with our service, e.g. when you use our website or mobile app, or engage with our communications;
* when you request an eligibility check;
* between your interactions with our service (whilst you're still signed up to our service);
* when new credit products and services are added to the website;
* when there is a change to your credit bureau data or Experian Credit Score (and we may pro-actively check your credit bureau data and Experian Credit Score to do this â€“ which will not affect your credit rating);
* when we predict you may be interested in a new credit product or service, for example if your existing promotional period is coming to an end;
Updates when you might save money or benefit from new products
As part of our free services (which are available to all customers), Experian will use your current and historical credit information (from Experian's credit bureau) to identify opportunities to potentially save money or benefit from new products.
The type of credit information we will retrieve includes things like whether you're carrying a balance on a credit card, loan or mortgage account, what payments you have made, promotional indicators, how long you've had the account for and who your accounts are with. Based on this, we may notify you of these opportunities and may invite you to compare products available as part of our panel.
If you have used our insurance comparison service and our system identifies that your insurance renewal is due, we will submit your quote details to give you an idea of what your quotes could be for your next renewal.
Managing your updates and notifications
We may send you personalised product updates via email, SMS or postal communication about your eligibility for products and when we think you might save money or benefit from new products. These updates and the use of your personal data to create them can be managed within your Messaging Settings from your Experian Account page.

* To give you an indication of whether you could afford to take on additional credit/borrowing based on your existing income and spending
* To show you a breakdown and categorisation of your spending habits and how you could make changes to increase the amount you could afford to borrow
* To notify you about possible savings you could make on utilities, credit cards, personal loans or the other product types featured within our comparison services
* To inform you of relevant products and services based on your existing income and spending

Public Interest
*  **To use special category data in order to generate insurance quotations.**

We will also need to share this data with the insurers, brokers and aggregators for insurance purposes so that we can arrange your insurance for you. These third parties need this information to enable them to generate quotes.
It may also be necessary for us to retain a copy of any special category data and criminal conviction or offence data for the purpose of making or defending claims or preventing or detecting crime, including fraud.

7.  Individuals
You can obtain a copy of the information we hold about you. See section Your rights to how we use your personal information for further information on how you can do this.
Where in the world do we send information?
Experian is based in the UK, which is where our main databases are. We also operate elsewhere in and outside the European Economic Area, so we may access your personal information from and transfer it to these locations as well. Don't worry though, any personal information we access from or transfer to these locations is protected by European data protection standards.
While countries in the European Economic Area all ensure rigorous data protection laws, there are parts of the world that may not be quite so rigorous and don't provide the same quality of legal protection when it comes to your personal information.
To make sure we keep your personal information safe, we apply strict safeguards when transferring it overseas. For example:
1. Sending your personal information to countries approved by the European Commission as having high quality data protection laws, such as Switzerland, Canada and the Isle of Man.
2. Putting in place a contract that has been approved by the European Commission with the recipient of your personal information that provides a suitable level of high quality protection.

To request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, please follow http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/data-access.

This only applies if we are processing it using automation only. If you would like more information about this, let us know by contacting our data protection officer at uk.dpo@experian.com.
We will try to ensure that we deliver the best levels of customer service but if you think we are falling short of that commitment, please let us know by contacting our data protection officer at uk.dpo@experian.com.
