a. Third Parties We Work With
This Policy does not govern information you submit via Artist Websites save where submitted using the Songkick Platform. We are not responsible for any use of such data by Artists, regardless of whether it has been submitted through the Songkick Platform or not. The Sites may contain links to Artists or other third-party websites. These linked sites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Company or any of its affiliates, or any Artists.
If you provide any information through any such third-party website (other than via use of the Songkick Platform), your transaction will occur on such third-party’s website (and not the Sites) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third-party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. You should be aware that if you should encounter an advertisement, link or reference to a third-party website on the Sites, even if we have a relationship with them, we do not control them, their websites or their policies and practices regarding use of their websites, transaction policies or any rules they have regarding the use of cookies or collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.

Cookie Policy
The Sites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Sites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Sites and also allows us to improve our site. By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.
We use the following cookies:
Essential cookies - These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
Analytical/performance cookies - They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Sites when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way the Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
Functionality cookies - These are used to recognize you when you return to the Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences, for example, your choice of language or region.
Targeting cookies - These cookies record your visit to the Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make the Sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” also commonly known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags” ) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic and often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than a single (1x1) pixel, that is placed on the Sites, though ordinarily not visible to the Sites’ visitors, and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.
If you want more information about the individual cookies, we recommend you to download a cookie management tool like Ghostery (www.ghostery.com) which allows you to understand and control the cookies set by a website.
Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies
You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Sites.
Except for essential cookies, all cookies we use will expire after three (3) months.
