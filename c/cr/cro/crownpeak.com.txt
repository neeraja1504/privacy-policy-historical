Data security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Crownpeak uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing communications and transactions across the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as cloud login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology. The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications between the browser and our web server. Data transmitted over an SSL connection cannot be tampered with or forged without the two parties (you and Crownpeak) becoming immediately aware of the tampering. A key or padlock icon in the browser window identifies the security mode of most popular browsers. When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key is broken or the padlock is open.
Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is now in “secure” mode. SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption. Crownpeak uses certificates from well known providers of digital trust services that enable businesses and consumers to engage in commerce and communications with confidence. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at privacy@crownpeak.com.
For data collected by websites hosted by Crownpeak on behalf of its customers, Crownpeak ensures that all applicable Privacy Shield Principles are applied to the data for as long as it is hosted by Crownpeak and under Crownpeak’s control.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve and enable services we offer you, marketing, analytics, product functionality, and website functionality.
Service provider, sub-processors/onward transfer
Crownpeak may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this privacy policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Licensees. If we engage a third party to process your data on our behalf, that third party will also be bound by our privacy policy and authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Data retention
Crownpeak will retain the personal data we collect from you for as long as needed. To provide services to our customers or to support our own marketing programs as described above.
