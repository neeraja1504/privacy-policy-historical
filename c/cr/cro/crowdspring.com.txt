What Information Do We Collect?
You can browse most of our site without telling us who you are. In order to start or participate in projects, you are required to register. If you choose to give us personal information when you register, go through our verification process as a creative, authenticate into your account, communicate with us, answer our surveys, upload content, or otherwise use our services, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. We may collect and store the following personal information in the United States, and other countries:
email address, physical contact information, and financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers (we do not store credit card numbers - those are stored by our merchang processing partner);
when you apply to work as a creative on crowdspring, the official government identification that you use to verify your identity, and your photo;
When you use our site to request payments, we collect information about when and where the transactions occur, a description of your request, the payment or transfer amounts, and standard web log information used to make the request;
transactional information based on your activities on crowdspring.com (such as your projects or entries to a project);

standard web log information, such as connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our site, ad data, geolocation data,your operating system and version, including the type and version of the browser you use, and IP address.
If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the Information described above will depend on the specific Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect and use Information from you where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Typically, our legitimate interests include improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, and services; ensuring the security of the services and our website; for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party; and for our marketing activities. Where required by law, we will collect Information only where we have your consent to do so.

How Secure Is The Information We Collect?
Your information is stored on our servers (managed by Amazon AWS services) located in the United States. Crowdspring is committed to industry best practices concerning security to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our possession. However, as you know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
Transactions on ouy website are conducted in a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session, which encrypts all transaction data for transmittal in a format that prevents theft of the information. While on a secure page, the lock in your web browser becomes locked and this lets you know that you are in a secured session. Our servers are located in a secure, supervised environment. Our databases are accessible only by persons who have entered into and are bound by a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement with us.

How Can You Use Information from crowdspring?
crowdspring allows users to share personal information to complete transactions and to enter into agreements with each other (such as the project contract). We encourage you to respect the privacy of others. To help protect the privacy of all users, we allow only limited access to other users' contact information to facilitate transactions. When users are involved in a transaction (after a project winner is selected), they will have access to each other's name and contact information. You agree to use another user's information only for:
crowdspring transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;
other purposes that the other user expressly permits.
Neither we nor our users like spam. You may not add other crowdspring users to your mailing list (email or physical mail), or share, rent or sell other users’ contact information, without their express consent. To report crowdspring-related spam or spoof emails to crowdspring, please forward the email to us: https://www.crowdspring.com/help/contact/. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Site Policies. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell email addresses.
