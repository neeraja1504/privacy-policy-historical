Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of data sent to your computer when you visit the Website and which enable Us to collect information about you. They are stored in the cookie directory of your hard-drive, and do not necessarily expire at the end of your session although session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. The information We collect in this way may include data about how you use the Website, information about your computer (including your IP address and browser type), demographic data and, if you visited the Website by clicking on a link from a different website, the URL of that website. We may also collect information about your online activity, such as the pages you have viewed and the purchases you have made. Our use of cookies also allows registered users of the Website to be presented with a personalised version of the Website, to carry out transactions and to have access to information about their account.
Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of cookies, you can specify that you wish to be prompted before a website puts a cookie on your hard drive, so that you can decide whether to allow it. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to accept any cookies. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen for information about how to do this. If you disable cookies, you may not have access to certain features that make your experience of the Website more efficient and some of Our Services may not function properly, such as placing an online order.

Social networking
Cross.com may offer you the opportunity to share or follow information about the Website (or the products and/or services available through it) using third party social networking functionality (such as through "share this", "like" or "follow" buttons).
We offer this functionality in order to generate interest in Cross.com among the members of your social networks, and to permit you to share and follow opinions, news and recommendations about the Website with your friends. However, you should be aware that sharing personal or non-personal information with a social network may result in that information being collected by the social network provider or result in that information being made publicly-available, including through Internet search engines.
Please note that We do not exercise any endorse or control the policies or practices of any third party social network whose functionality you may access through Cross.com. You should always read the privacy policy of any social network through which you share information carefully in order to understand their specific privacy and information usage practices.

Links to external sites from the Website

These websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy and our company is not responsible for the privacy practices within any of these other websites. You should be aware of this when you leave the Website and We encourage you to read the privacy statements of other websites.
Internet based transfers
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Territories outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") may not have laws which provide the same level of protection for personal information as those inside the EEA. However, if We process your personal information on servers or use third party service providers based in such territories, We will endeavour to ensure that your personal information is afforded the same level of protection as in the EEA. By visiting the Website and communicating electronically with Us, you acknowledge Our processing of personal information in this way.

If this Privacy Policy changes in any way, We will place an updated version on this webpage. If you do not agree with the changes We make please do not continue to use the Website. Regularly reviewing this webpage ensures you are always aware of what information We collect, how We use it and under what circumstances, if any, We will share it with other parties.
