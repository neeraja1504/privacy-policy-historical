Unless we have your permission, we will share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide online only with other crossmark.com entities and/or businesses that provide services to crossmark.com and only for the purposes described above. Where crossmark.com engages third parties to perform services on our behalf, we will require them to observe the intent of this Online Privacy Statement. On some pages we may offer you the opportunity to receive information from companies with products or services that may be of interest to you. If you choose to receive such information, crossmark.com may assist these companies in their marketing activities by forwarding their messages to you, but we will not provide these companies with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. Our Site, crossmark.com, or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or their respective assets could be acquired. Should such a combination or acquisition occur, you should expect that crossmark.com would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to continue serving you and other users of our Site.
