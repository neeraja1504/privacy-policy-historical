Crooked provides you this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to help you understand the kinds of information Crooked may gather about you when you visit the Site or use any of Crooked’s Services, and how Crooked may collect, use and disclose the information.
The use of the phrase “Personal Information” in this Policy means information that identifies a specific person such as a person’s full name, address, e-mail address. The phrase “Anonymous Information” in this Policy means non-personal information that cannot reasonably be used to identify individual persons ( e.g. , interests, demographics and anonymous usage data).
By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to Crooked’s collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.
Your Personal Information will be processed by Crooked in the United States.
In addition to this general Policy, each Service may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular Service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular Service at the time Crooked collects the information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the use of your information.
In general you can use the Site and/or Service without telling Crooked who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, if you do not provide Crooked with certain requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and features that may be contained on the Site and/or Service.
INFORMATION GATHERED BY CROOKED

A. Information you voluntarily provide Crooked.
Crooked collects and maintains information that you voluntarily submit to Crooked during your use of the Site and Services. For example:
When you register for the Site, certain provided information to Crooked will be required such as your name and email address;
When you post comments and/or content on the Site and/or Service information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, likes, status, profile information and/or picture. This information is always public, which means it is available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
If you sign up to enter a contest or sweepstakes or receive a newsletter, if any, you may provide Crooked contact information (e.g., email or physical address);
If you access or log-in to the Site and/or Services through a social media or other service or connect the Site and/or Services to a social media or other service, the information Crooked collects may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with Crooked, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Site and/or Services through social media services or when you connect the Site and/or Service to social media services, you are authorizing Crooked to collect, store, and use such information and in accordance with this Policy;
If you purchase a product or service, you may provide Crooked your credit card information; and

B. Information Crooked collects through your use of the Site.
As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies, Crooked may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example Crooked may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in Los Angeles and Crooked may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting Los Angeles-based businesses. This information allows Crooked to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements.
Information Crooked may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties (“Third Parties”) with the information Crooked has already collected from you via Crooked’s Site and/or Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including verifying other information about you and to enhance the content and advertising Crooked provides to you.
Crooked and Third Parties may customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide Crooked; (ii) data Crooked receives from third parties; or (iii) your visits on the Site or use of Services and other websites or services (commonly referred to as “Behavioral Advertising”).
