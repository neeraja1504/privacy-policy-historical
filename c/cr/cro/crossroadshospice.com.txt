Crossroads
Hospice
and
its

are
required
by
law
to
maintain
the
privacy
of
“protected

“Protected
health
information”
includes
any
identifiable
information
we
obtain
from
you
or
others
that
relates
to
your
physical
or
mental
health,
the
health
care
you
have
received,
or
payment
for
your
health
care.
As
required
by
law,
this
notice
provides
you
with
information
about
your
rights
and
our
legal
duties
and
privacy
practices
with
respect
to
the
privacy
of
protected
health
information.
This
notice
also
discusses
the
uses
and
disclosures
we
will
make
of
your
protected
health
information.
We
must
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
notice,
although
we
reserve
the
right
to
change
the
terms
of
this
notice
from
time
to
time
and
to
make
the
revised
notice
effective
for
all
protected
health
information
we
maintain.
You
can
always
request
a
copy
of
the
most
current
privacy
notice
from
our
Privacy
Officer.
Instructions
on
how
to
make
such
requests
and
the
contact
information
for
the
Privacy
Officer
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
document.
The
laws
governing
this
notice
and
Crossroads
Hospice
obligations
there
under
include:
1.1         The
Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
of
1996
(HIPAA).
To
improve
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
health
care
system,
the
Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
of
1996
(HIPAA),
Public
Law
104-­‐191,
included
Administrative
Simplification
provisions
that
required
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
to
adopt
national
standards
for
electronic
health
care
transactions
and
code
sets,
unique
health
identifiers,
and
security.
At
the
same
time,
Congress
recognized
that
advances
in
electronic
technology
could
erode
the
privacy
of
health
information.
Consequently,
Congress
incorporated
into
HIPAA
provisions
that
mandated
the
adoption
of
Federal
privacy
protections
for
individually
identifiable
health
information.
1.2         The
Health
Information
Technology
for
Economic
and
Clinical
Health
Act
(HITECH)
enacted
as
part
of
the
American
Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009
(ARRA).
Subtitle
D
of
the
HITECH
Act
addresses
the
privacy
and
security
concerns
associated
with
the
electronic
transmission
of
health
information,
in
part,
through
several
provisions
that
strengthen
the
civil
and
criminal
enforcement
of
the
HIPAA
rules.
1.3         The
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act
of
2010
(ACA).
The
ACA
builds
upon
HIPAA
with
new
and
expanded
provisions,
including
requirement
to
adopt
operating
rules
for
each
of
the
HIPAA
covered
transactions;
a
unique,
standard
Health
Plan
Identifier;
and
a
standard
for
electronic
funds
transfer.
ACA
requires
that
health
plans
certify
their
compliance
with
the
standards
and
operating
rules,
and
increases
penalties
for
noncompliance.

3.             USES
AND
DISCLOSURES
OF
PROTECTED
HEALTH

Your
protected
health
information
may
be
used
and
disclosed
by
your
physician,
our
office
staff
and
others
outside
of
our
office
who
is
involved
in
your
care
and
treatment
for
the
purpose
of
providing
health
care
services
to

Your
protected
health

may
also
be
used
and
disclosed
to
pay
your
health
care
bills
and
to
support
the
operation
of
your
physician’s
practice.
Following
are
examples
of
the
types
of
uses
and
disclosures
of
your
protected
health
information
that
your
physician’s
office
is
permitted
to
make.
These
examples
are
not
meant
to
be
exhaustive,
but
to
describe
the
types
of
uses
and
disclosures
that
may
be
made
by
our
office.
3.1          Treatment:
We
will
use
and
disclose
your
protected
health
information
to
provide,
coordinate,
or
manage
your
health
care
and
any
related
services.
This
includes
the
coordination

of
your
health

with
another

For

we
would
disclose
your

a
home
health
agency
that
provides
care
to
you.
We
will
also
disclose
protected
health

to
other
physicians
who
may
be
treating
you.
For
example,
your
protected
health
information
may
be
provided
to
a
physician
to
whom
you
have
been
referred
to
ensure
that
the
physician
has
the
necessary
information
to
diagnose
or
treat
you.
In
addition,
we
may
disclose
your
protected
health

from

provided

health

these
rights.
6.1            You

This

of
protected
health

You

records
and
any
other

that
your
physician
and

uses
for

law,
we
may
charge

for
a

a

administrative
action
or
proceeding;
and
laboratory
results
that
are
subject
to
law
that
prohibits
access
to
protected

Depending
on
the
circumstances,
a
decision
to
deny
access
may
be
reviewable.
In
some
circumstances,
you
may
have
a
right
to
have
this
decision
reviewed.
Please
contact
our
Privacy

if
you
have
