Privacy Policy | Crate and Barrel
By sharing the Privacy Policy for Crate and Barrel and CB2 (collectively, “we” or “us”), we hope to help you understand how information can create new opportunities for you, our customer, as well as to reassure you that we respect and honor customer requests to restrict and protect personal information.
Information We Collect
Information you provide to us:
When you use our services:
When you make a purchase in one of our stores or on crateandbarrel.com, cb2.com, or our mobile apps (collectively, “Websites”) or otherwise, create an account, join our Gift Registry, participate in a sweepstakes or contest or any other promotion, post a product review, engage with us on our various social media platforms, apply for our credit card, participate in one of our surveys, send us any feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or interact with us in any way, you provide us with personal information, such as: your name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, phone number and credit card numbers. This allows us to provide you with our services, to process your transactions more efficiently and, ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. If you choose not to provide the requested information we may not be able to provide you with the services, or certain features of those services may not be functional.
When you apply for a job:
Our Website includes a Careers feature that allows you to submit an online job application, if you reside in the US or in Canada. When you submit an online application, you will be required to provide personal information, including but not limited to your name, contact information, job interests, educational and job history, and references. This information will be used by us to assess and process your application.
You will also be asked to provide equal opportunities information. This is not mandatory – if you don’t provide it, it won’t affect your application. We won’t make the information available to any staff outside our recruitment team, including hiring managers, in a way that can identify you. Any information you provide will be used to produce and monitor equal opportunities statistics.
The online application process is hosted and supported by a third-party service provider, iCIMS. iCIMS receives and stores the information you provide. iCIMS does not disclose the personal information it receives and maintains for us to anyone else. [Click here to see the icims privacy policy]
If we decide to interview you, we may print your application and use it during the interview process. If you are hired, your application becomes part of your employee file. If you are not immediately hired, your printed application is kept for two years and then typically will be destroyed. We may ask you to provide additional information during the interview or hiring process. We may also use the information you provide to contact you about your application; for example, to ask you to agree to a background check or to send you an offer letter.
We do not share the information you provide in the online application to anyone outside of Crate and Barrel/CB2 and iCIMS, except as we believe is required by law.
Information about you we receive from third parties:
Other companies we do business with may forward to us additional personal information (such as, for example, names, mailing addresses and email addresses, as well as demographic and other usage information), when we have news or product offerings that may be of interest to those individuals.This does not apply to you if you reside in the EU.

This data is used to improve store layout and enhance customer shopping experience in our stores.

How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect about you to facilitate your purchases, to communicate with you, to offer better customer service, and to improve our services and customer relations.
To facilitate your purchases: This includes processing your order and payment, shipping the order (including those initiated through our International Quote Form), providing you with technical support and assistance, and communicating with you about the purchase by email. For example, we will contact you by phone, postal mail or email to update you of the arrival of the package, to address any issues with the order or to answer any questions you may have about your order. If you are located in the EU, we will contact you using the contact information you provide (e.g. email, phone, mailing address). The legal basis for this processing of your information is the performance of our contract with you.
To send you promotional communications: If you sign up, we will contact you by email or send you our catalogs to inform you about products, services, and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. You can opt out of email communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email as or as explained here. You can opt out of receiving our catalogs using this catalog opt-out form. Participation in our catalog mailing list is not open to users from EU locations.

Facilitating International Purchases: If you are shipping internationally, your purchase of our products on the Websites is facilitated through our service provider Borderfree. Our privacy policy governs our use of information you provide to us and information collected from you before you get to the checkout section on our Websites. The use of information after you get to the checkout section is governed by the Borderfree terms of use and privacy policy. Borderfree gets access to the items that you place in the cart before hitting checkout and your chosen international shipping location, as well as any contact information you choose to provide in checkout. The legal basis for this processing of your information is our legitimate interest in facilitating international purchases efficiently.
Marketing: We share your customer information with other select companies whose products and services you may find useful. This information includes your name, postal address and email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our Website or offline. These companies may contact you in order to provide you with information about their products and services. To learn how to opt out of this sharing of your information please click here. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address and phone number. After we process your request, your personal information will no longer be shared for marketing purposes. We do not share information of users of our websites who provide an EU mailing address or are identified as being from EU locations.
Online Advertising: We contract with Service Providers to place our banner advertising on other websites. These Service Providers collect information from us about your visits to our Websites and stores, and your interaction with our products and services. They also use this information to tailor banner advertisements for goods and services when you visit certain websites. We may track this information across the different devices you use to access the Websites. Our Service Providers are required to keep this data anonymous and not to share any personal information with any other third parties, except as required to provide this service. Our Service Providers do not collect EU IP addresses for the purpose of advertising and we do not place banner advertising on other websites for customers identified as being from EU locations.
Sharing among our entities: We share and combine information about you among our brands in order to provide greater security. We also share your information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control as necessary for specific purposes in the operation of our business. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in the security and efficient operation of our services.
We share and combine information about our US based customers of products and services that may interest them. You can learn how to opt out of promotional emails from our entities as explained here.
Sharing with service providers: In order to serve you better, we may, at times, contract with other companies (“Service Providers”) to help us process information and to provide us with other services. Their assistance can help us fulfill customer orders, manage, store and enhance customer data, send marketing, run promotions, and provide other services. For instance, when you order a large furniture item, we may send your name, address, email address and phone number to our shipping vendor, allowing you to access their online delivery scheduling system. Our vendors use your information strictly to coordinate and complete your shipment. The legal basis for this sharing of your information is our legitimate interest in providing our services efficiently. For users of our website from the EU, our Service Provider Borderfree facilitates the purchase. [see "Facilitating International Purchases"
In connection with a business reorganization: We would share your information if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, consolidation, change of control or sale of all or a portion of our assets or if we undergo bankruptcy or liquidation. The legal basis for this sharing is our legitimate interest in carrying out our business operations.
In order to comply with our legal obligations, protect our rights and those of others: We share your information in order to prevent fraud or abuse to our services, to protect your rights, to comply with our legal obligations and to protect our rights. The legal basis for this sharing is compliance with the law and our legitimate interest in the prevention of fraud, compliance with legal obligation and the protection of the rights of others.
Prevent fraud and abuse of the services: We review transactions internally on a regular basis to identify potential concerns, and we partner with select outside companies to further enhance our ability to ensure that fraudulent orders and/or potentially damaging worms, viruses and other types of malware do not interfere with our ability to provide the best possible products, value and services to you and to our other valued customers.
Protect your rights: We will share information in an emergency or to protect the safety of any person and if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person.
Protect our rights and comply with our legal obligations: We cooperate with government and law-enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and any other information about you to government or law-enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas); to protect our safety, property or rights or those of any third party; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity; or to comply with the law.
When relying on legitimate interest as our legal basis we implement appropriate safeguards including as described in information sharing choices, your rights under EU data protection laws and information security

Marketing: If you do not want us to share your personal information for marketing purposes, please contact us and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address and phone number. After we process your request, your personal information will no longer be shared for marketing purposes. Opting out of sharing your information for marketing purposes will not prevent your relevant information from being provided to our Service Providers such as shippers when you order products for delivery or from other sharing for non-marketing purposes. Similarly, this will not prevent us from sharing information as and to the extent it is combined or aggregated (in a non-personally identified manner) or otherwise analyzed by us or our Service Providers.

If you choose to opt out, we will place an "opt-out cookie" on your computer. The "opt-out cookie" is browser specific and device specific and only lasts until cookies are cleared from your browser or device. The opt-out cookie will not work for some cookies that are important to how our websites and mobile apps work ("essential cookies"). If the cookie is removed or deleted, if you upgrade your browser or if you visit us from a different computer, you will need to return to the links above to re-select your preferences.
Mobile app communications: You can deactivate push notifications in our mobile apps at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.
Email promotional communications: To delete your name from our email contact lists, please follow these email opt-out instructions. Please note that, to provide you with more control of your experience with us, opting out of one brand does not automatically opt you out of our other brands. For example, if you click through to opt out of emails from CB2, you will not be opted out of emails from Crate and Barrel.
Catalog: To request to have your name removed from the catalog mailing list, please complete this catalog opt-out form. We appreciate your patience while we process your request. When you make subsequent purchases at Crate and Barrel or CB2, you may provide contact information for customer service only, and request that your name not be forwarded to either mailing list. If you have already opted out, you do not need to opt out again; your information will not be used for purposes other than the customer service you have requested, unless you affirmatively ask to opt in again, in which case you will be opted in and will receive emails from us until you again request to be opted out again.
Email tracking: To opt out of our use of cookies to track your interaction with our email communications, you can click the "unsubscribe" link found in each email you receive or remove yourself from the relevant mailing list or lists as described here.
Website Analytics: You can opt out of our Website analysis tool by clicking here. See above for information on opting out of Google and Adobe Analytics.

Dispute resolution, Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights
We are committed to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. Please direct your inquiries or complaints to privacy@crateandbarrel.com.
Notwithstanding the below, if you reside in the EU, in the event your concerns in connection with how we process your information are not addressed you can file a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in the country of your residence.
You and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us relating to this Privacy Policy or the Websites (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or us from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Privacy Policy, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Privacy Policy.
Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Privacy Policy will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Privacy Policy. This Section of the Privacy Policy will survive the termination of your relationship with us.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
