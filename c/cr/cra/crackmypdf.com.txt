Definitions
‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.
‘Personal data’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data,
an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the
same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers
more data.
A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “member” is someone who has
registered with us to use or buy our services and products. The term “user” is a collective
identifier that refers to either a visitor or a member.

You may have to provide a credit card to buy products and services from our website. We use
third-party billing services and have no control over these services. We use our commercially
reasonable efforts to make sure your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using

are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.
Transferring PD From the European Union
(PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the
countries in which we operate. The European Union has not found the United States and some
other countries to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our
company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For
European Union customers and users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside
the European Union to the United States and or other countries. We will use your PD to provide
the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or
to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your
freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable
steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our
privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD
described within this section.
