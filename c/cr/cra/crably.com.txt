Crably
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This policy covers how Crably IVS ("Crably," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on http://crably.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the sole purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.
This policy applies where we are acting as a Data Controller with respect to the Personal Data of our website visitors and service users; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that Personal Data to be compliant with the GDPR.
Data Controller ” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data.
GDPR ” means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
Personal Data ” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual where such information is contained within Customer Data and is protected similarly as personal data or personally identifiable information under applicable Data Protection Law
Data Protection Law ” means all applicable legislation relating to data protection and privacy including without limitation the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and all local laws and regulations which amend or replace any of them, including the GDPR, together with any national implementing laws in any Member State of the European Union or, to the extent applicable, in any other country, as amended, repealed, consolidated or replaced from time to time. The terms “process”, “processes” and “processed” will be construed accordingly.
Crably processes personal information and we have therefore adopted this privacy policy under the General Data Pretection Regulation (GDPR), which is the new European Personal Organization, which aims to protect you and your personal information.
We are, of course, living up to all the requirements for the protection of your personal information according to the GDPR.
As we process personal information, we have adopted this Privacy Policy, which tells you how we treat your data.
If you can’t be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised) then this notice doesn’t apply.
Who are ‘we’?
When we refer to “we” (or "Crably, "us," or "our"), that means Crably and all its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our company is located in Denmark. Address details for all Crably offices are available on our Contact us page.
We provide an easy-to-use global online platform for any businesses and their private people.At the core of our platform is our cloud Software as a Service software. If you want to find out more about what we do, see the  About Crably page.
