CrazyFree - Privacy Policy
About Crazy Free
Crazy Free (Cohort Australia Pty Ltd ABN: 54600161386 and its UK subsidiary Cohort Global Limited CN: 07305185 & ICO: ZA059079) provides permission based marketing services to major high street and online brands. We provide a service designed to deliver sales leads from consumers who have consented to be contacted.
Crazy Free has wealth of lifestyle and demographic data that we collect directly and openly from consumers. We do this by publishing a variety of online consumer surveys and conducting a range of permission based direct mail and telemarketing activity on a range of different websites. Crazy Free allows consumers to engage with specific brands or categories of products and services they have indicated they wish to hear from. Crazy Free provides a range of other services to companies using our database.
One of Crazy Free’s key business objectives is commitment to open and transparent information practices – informing individuals about how we collect and use personal information and protect the information privacy of those individuals. Personal information is information about an identified individual or one who is reasonably identifiable.
Crazy Free complies with the AU Privacy Act 1988 including the AU Privacy Principles and other AU regulations such as the AU Do Not Call Register Act 2006, the AU Spam Act 2003, UK Data Protection Act 1998, General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) and the (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 which govern how it must handle personal information (Privacy Act). Our Privacy Policy explains how we do this. For UK residents to find out more information about your rights around the data protection act and GDPR please visit https://ico.org.uk.
Crazy Free may change the Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and privacy regulation. Any changes will come into effect when an updated Privacy Policy is posted to our website.
