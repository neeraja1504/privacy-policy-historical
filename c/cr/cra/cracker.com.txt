Cracker Privacy Policy
Last Revised: Aug 25, 2015
Cracker.com and its affiliates (collectively, the “Site”) respect your privacy. Here is our Privacy Policy for this Site:
Acceptance of Privacy Policy
Each time you access, use, post, submit a post or reply, or browse the Site, you signify your acceptance of the then-current Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site and must discontinue use of the Site immediately.
Liability for content
The content of our sites is delivered with utmost diligence and care possible. However, the Site cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, integrity and actuality of the content. In cases of declaration of violation of rights, the Site will delete the concerned content at the soonest possible time.
Liability for links
Our site contains links to external websites over which we have no control. Thus, the Site cannot be held accountable for the content of those third party websites and the consequences that may arise from the existence of such links on the Site. The operator or provider of the mentioned content is the one responsible for their respective site content. The linked-to websites were reviewed concerning possible violation of rights at the point of publication. However, some illegal content may not be recognizable at the point of publication. A constant and permanent monitoring of the links included on the Site without concrete indication and necessity is deemed unreasonable and infeasible. But in cases of declaration of violation of rights, the Site will delete the concerned link(s) at the soonest possible time.
Collection and processing of personal data
Ads on the Site are obviously made available to the public. Our servers are located in the European Union. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you are consenting to the transfer and storage of that information to and on our servers in the European Union.
We collect and store the following personal information:
• Email address, physical location/contact information and financial information (depending on the service used)
• Computer sign-in data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site as well as ad data (Through cookies which you can disable on your browser. However, this is likely to affect your ability to use the site in terms of functionality).
• Other information including your IP address and standard web log information.
We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication via e-mail) can lead to security issues. A complete protection of data against access of third parties is not possible.
Transfer of personal data
Transfer or provision of personal data to a third party occurs only if the Site is lawfully obligated to provide information to authorities in relation to an ad that a user has posted, or if the user has given prior consent to the release of personal data. Otherwise, personal data will not be released, shared or sold to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes without prior permission from the user.
Collection of Non-Personal Information Using Cookies
We automatically receive and record non-personal information on our server logs from your browser as well as through other analysis of the Sites.

“Cookies” are small text files that allow Web sites to store and retrieve information about you from your computer system. The Site does serve cookies to track individual site usage for later aggregation.

We have no control over whether and how our advertisers use cookies that originate from their website.
Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
We may disclose your personal information to agents and operators under confidentiality or similar agreements, including shippers, vendors, payment processors, and advertisers, who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information: (i) to provide products or services to you; (ii) to administer our business or the Site, including fulfilling and shipping orders; (iii) to provide customer service; (iv) to update account information; (v) to forward updates, announcements, and newsletters; (vi) to respond to your communications, and communicate with you about the Site and other activities related to the Site; (vii) in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or disposition of all or any portion of the Site’s business or operations (including without limitation in connection with bankruptcy or any similar proceedings); or (viii) as otherwise authorized by you.

We may also provide information about you if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
