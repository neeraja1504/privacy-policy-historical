While we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our website, and you do so at your own risk. As a result, to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, we urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone, log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
