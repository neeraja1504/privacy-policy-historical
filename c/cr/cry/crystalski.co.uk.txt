Privacy policy
TUI UK Limited's Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it. Our Privacy Policy applies to you and is available on our website and through other channels. In all your dealings with us you must ensure that others you represent are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf.
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
Your Information
This refers to a combination of information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including your social preferences, interests and activities and any information about other persons you represent (such as those on your booking). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa), make a booking, use our website(s)/apps, link to or from our website(s)/apps, connect with us via social media and any other engagement we or our business partners have with you.
We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.
Our Use of Your Information
For the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday, security, incident/accident management or insurance, etc., we may disclose and process your information outside the UK/EEA. In order for you to travel abroad, it may be mandatory (as required by government authorities at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your information for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. Some countries will only permit travel if you provide your advance passenger data (for example Caricom API and US secure flight data). These requirements may differ depending on your destination and you are advised to check. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.
We may collect and process your information for the purposes set out below and in our registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our group companies for business purposes and also to companies and our service providers who act as "data processors" on our behalf, or to credit and fraud agencies (some of whom are located outside the UK/EEA). These purposes include administration, service, quality and improvement-related activities, customer care, product innovation and choice, business management, operation and efficiencies, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or group companies), risk assessment/management, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, social media, reviews, advertising and marketing, loyalty programmes, profiling customer purchasing preferences, activities and trends, dispute resolution/litigation, credit checking and debt collection.
Information (such as health or religion) may be considered "sensitive personal data" under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to provide you with our services, cater to your needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal data on the condition that we have your positive consent. By booking with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to exchange relevant information and sensitive personal data with us in circumstances where we/they need to act on your behalf or in the interest of passengers or in an emergency.
If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Information above, we cannot engage/do business with you or accept your booking.
Marketing Material
Using your information, we may from time to time contact you with or make available to you (directly or indirectly) information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our group companies. We will tailor the information you receive or see; this will enable us to make available to you more personalised and relevant communications. We may use innovative technologies and work with business partners to achieve this.
We will assume you agree to email when you make an e-booking or provide us with your email in other situations such as in-store, competitions, promotions, prize draws and social media.
If you do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point 2 of "Your Rights" below.
Your Rights
On completing our Data Subject Access Request form, you are entitled to a copy of the information we hold about you (for a Â£10 fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.
You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material from us. If available, you can amend your previous preference on our website(s), use our "unsubscribe email", opt-out of personalised emails or refer to our literature containing instructions. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.
For a list of relevant brands, please send us your request.
Please write to TUI UK Limited, Legal Department, TUI Travel House, Crawley Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 9QL.

What is a cookie?
Cookies are small files that are sent to your browser, for example Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox. They are stored on your computer's hard disk and only identify your computer, and not you personally.
The default location for these files is:
Windows : c:\Documents and Settings\{your_username}\Cookies
Mac : Users\{your_username}\Library\Cookies
There are two main purposes to cookies. The first is to add functionality like shopping carts, logging in as a particular user, remembering preferences and sharing links via social media. Secondly, cookies are used by website owners to collect usage data and provide personalised suggestions and information.
How do we use cookies?
Cookies help to speed up the booking process so that you do not need to re-type the same information again and again. If you are making a purchase we will also use cookies to keep track of the transaction from one page to the next. We do not store any personal information in the cookie.
We also collect information relating to customer use and patterns. We use cookies and software tools to capture, measure and analyse site usage and related information.
When you are on our website, we use cookies to provide you with a more personal experience. In other words we use it to do things like remember what you've searched for (rather than typing it again when a new page loads) and to remember saved/recently searched accommodation. If you come back to the site at a later date then you'll be able to see any properties you have been researching recently.
When you are online but not using our website, to help us deliver advertising effectively and avoid repeating adverts, we work with carefully selected third parties who we allow to employ cookies on our site, on our behalf. These cookies allow us to provide advertising on other websites that are more relevant to a user's interests. The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain a user's name, address, telephone number or email address.
If you receive our emails, we tailor the information we send you based on the data our cookies have collected from your recent visits to our website. You can opt out of this in any marketing email we send.
