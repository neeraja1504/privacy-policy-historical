2. How and what information does pch.com gather or track?
We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial registration process for sweepstakes entry and order processing. Although some of the personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these services (e.g., an address is required to buy goods and services from pch.com), in some cases some of the information is optional. Users can determine to some extent what information they wish to submit. In addition to the initial registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer optional questions about products and services. We gather this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to any personal information.
Through the use of “cookies”, “pixel tags” and "flash cookies" and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on, among other things, the following information:
Demographic: age, gender, income level
Technical: IP address, domain name, e-mail address, site traffic
Reference: name, land address, telephone number, password
The website that referred you to us
The web pages you viewed on our site
The advertisements you viewed and clicked on at our site
Coupon activity including the types of coupons that you choose.
When you access PCH offered applications at social media sites like Facebook you allow us to access certain information from your profile at those sites. For example, when you access a game or application using the Facebook Platform, Facebook will usually provide the application your User ID, as well your friends' User IDs (or your friend list). The information you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you have established at the social media site. You can control and find out more about these settings at Facebook at facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy.
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Additionally, if you download and install the coupon printing software we collect information about that device that helps us manage our products and services and detect and prevent coupon fraud. Instructions on uninstalling our coupon printer software are available at couponsinc.com/corp/source/u_uninstall.asp

What are Cookies?
“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on most major web sites, pch.com may place and store Internet cookies on a user's hard drive. Cookies can save any of the types of information noted above. Cookies enable us to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on the pch.com site. For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to pch.com, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services that we think may interest you, and estimate our audience size. We also use cookies to store user names and information that are supplied at registration. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas on the site will not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.
“Pixel tracking“, a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that their advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personal information about you is not collected by the third party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web site activity to us.
We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.
Some of our business partners (e.g., tracking utility company) use cookies and tracking pixels on our site. We have no access to or control over our partners' use of these technologies.
What does pch.com do to keep their site secure?
We have implemented a number of security features throughout the pch.com site that are intended to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to the user information we collect online. For example, database information is firewall protected. Also, only authorized pch.com personnel have access to any stored personal information we collect from our users. Moreover, password and credit card information you submit to pch.com is always encrypted during transmission. Users should be aware that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.
While we strive to create a secure and reliable site for our users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted over the Internet cannot be 100% guaranteed. Users should keep in mind that any information submitted through an Internet transaction is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without their consent. pch.com is not responsible or liable for illegal interception of personal data via any Internet transaction. When we collect and transmit sensitive data such as your credit card number, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Does pch.com disclose user information to third parties?
Except as otherwise noted in this policy, pch.com only discloses user information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might tell a marketing partner how many users visited pch.com over a period of time, but we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer, unless that user has given us permission to do so.
We share our users Android ID with application tracking companies so that we can track whether a user has downloaded one of our Customer’s applications. We will share our unique ID for the user with our customer’s so that we are able to provide users with their prizes.
pch.com believes that consumers should be able to control the use of their data. Users always have the option whether to engage in offers presented on pch.com. In addition, the personal information our users provide to us may be combined with other personal information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. We use a third party to verify your address, in order to process your order prior to shipping. This allows us and, with permission, to present our users with offers and information geared towards their interests. pch.com is not and cannot be responsible for the activities or privacy policies of these third parties.
We do not rent, license, or sell personal data to third parties. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of pch.com, customer data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information as required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users.
You should also know that when you order a magazine subscription from pch.com, we need to provide your name and address to the magazine publisher so they can start your service. Publishers may exchange or rent their subscriber names, typically to third party companies that match reader interests. If you do not wish to receive such offers, we suggest that you notify the publisher directly (the contact information is usually found in each magazine issue).
We use other third parties such as credit card processors and e-mail service providers to provide order fulfillment and e-mail delivery services on our site. When you register on our site, we will share your personal information as necessary for these third parties to provide these services.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.

To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.
Targeted or Behavioral Advertising
Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual’s web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which pch.com advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than pch.com. For example, if you have shown a preference for cooking while visiting pch.com, you may be served an advertisement from pch.com for cooking related products when you visit a site other than pch.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from pch.com or through third party website publishers. We may use your personal data to serve you relevant ads based upon your interests through our own and select third party ad partners. In such cases, PCH will provide your personal data such as encrypted email address and mobile advertising identifier to such third party service providers so that we may serve you with ads that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out from being shown targeted advertising by our 3rd party providers, including Google, please click here: Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from pch.com and any other participating advertisers.

As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data helps us create a more personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service for our users.
