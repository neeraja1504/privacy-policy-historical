This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect and use personal and other information through our home security device, mobile applications, and web applications (our "Products" or "Services") and from visitors to our website https://canary.is (the "Site"). This Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information, how we share your information, and how you can access and update your information.
If you are a resident of the US or Canada, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Connect, Inc. Otherwise, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Technology Europe, Limited.

To fulfill orders and process payments for the sale of Products or Services from our Site.
Administer your account and back-up your data.
Record log entries for your information and troubleshooting issues with your device.
Send you notifications through the Canary app. You can manage your

Respond to your questions and concerns and provide customer support.
4. Choices You Have to Limit Information Collection
Location Services
Some features of our app use location-based data. If you allow these services, we will use information about the Wi-Fi routers and cell IDs of the towers closest to you. We use this information to facilitate the device’s automatic mode switching, for customer support related to our Products, and to provide you with local emergency service contact information. You may disable location services within your phone’s settings menu.
Video & Audio
You may configure your Canary device from within the mobile application to capture video and audio of your location within the camera’s range and provide you with notifications. You can set your Canary device to different modes from within the mobile app menu. Each mode determines when Canary records audio and video and when you receive notifications and can be customized depending on your settings. You should inform guests of any recording if the camera is on while others are in your home.
You may enable privacy mode or disable recording from within the app menu to prevent the recording of video and audio through the device. In privacy mode, the watch live video feature and event notifications are disabled and the camera and microphone are turned off. Your device will continue to monitor environmental activity in privacy mode so we may provide you with aggregated HomeHealth information. LED lights on the bottom of the device will be turned off to indicate the device is in privacy mode.
