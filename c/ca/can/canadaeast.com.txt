Welcome to our site. CanadaEast Interactive has created this Privacy Policy in order to document and communicate our commitment to doing business with the highest ethical standards and appropriate internal controls.
Our Privacy Policy is designed to give you, the user, more information on how information is collected, used and disclosed through this site. This document, together with our Terms of Use and Copyright Information govern our affiliates, partners, advertisers and CanadaEast Interactive's relationship with you in relation to this website. Please read them carefully.
The term "CanadaEast" or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the web site, CanadaEast Interactive, whose registered office is 939 Main Street, Moncton, New Brunswick E1C 8P3. CanadaEast is a division of Brunswick News Inc. of the same address.
The term "CE Network" refers collectively to sites owned by or managed by CanadaEast Interactive. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of our website or any persons with accessibility to this web site.
A. Defining Personal Information
CE Network is committed to providing our web site visitors with the advantages of online technology. Part of this commitment may include providing an interactive and personalized experience. CE Network may collect information including your name, email address, civic and postal address, telephone number, recorded communications, subscription information, product preferences, related billing records and other user supplied demographic data (hereinafter referred to as "Personally Identifiable Information") subjected to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
Please note this policy applies only to information collected by CE Network online and does not impact information collected or used by CE Network or its affiliates through other means.
B. Information Collection
CE Network will only ask for information about you that we need and will only ask for it when we need it. When we ask you for the information, we will explain to you why we need it and what we are going to do with it.
We will seek your prior consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the information as required by applicable privacy legislation. Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you can refuse to consent to our collection, use or disclosure of information about you. You may also withdraw your consent to any further collection, use or disclosure of information about you at any time by giving us reasonable notice. Please note that some features and functions of this site that require personal information may become unavailable should you withdrawl consent. If our intended disclosures or uses of information change, we will notify you accordingly on this policy page.
CE Network collects and stores various information depending on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. CE Network collects and uses your personal information primarily for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested from us, including daily delivery of news, premium access and related content.
You may visit many pages on our site without providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is collected by the CE Network only when you specifically and knowingly choose to provide it to us.
You may optionally choose to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, subscribe to premium services, request certain features, sign up for a newspaper subscription or make a purchase. You may also choose to provide Personally Identifiable Information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, comments, discussions, message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most web sites, CE Network also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. As an example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology. This information can not be used to identify you and is referred to as "Aggregated Information".
Information that has been disclosed through CE Network as provided by another user, for example email addresses utilized when using our "Share" feature, are not collected or stored by CE Network. CE Network does not maintain databases of these email addresses. If you wish to not receive share email notices from CE Network visitors, you may be blocked by contacting CE Network.
C. Use of Your Information
We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners.
Collected Personally Identifiable Information may be used to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on CE Network to communicate with you regarding your account, subscription and premium services, our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, products and services offered by CE Network and other CanadaEast affiliates, advertisers and partners, administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce transactions and execution of other site operations included in our services or requested by you. We reserve the right to share this information with other CanadaEast Interactive business units and affiliates, including for example our affiliated newspapers and entities in which CanadaEast has an ownership interest.
Unless you specifically authorize us to release your personal information, or release is required or permitted by law, the CE Network will not sell, lease, trade or otherwise permit access to your personal information to other third parties.
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose than those permitted in this Privacy Policy without your consent.
