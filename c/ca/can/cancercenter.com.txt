We may de-identify or aggregate your information with other that of users of the Services. This de-identified or Aggregate Information may be used by us for any lawful purpose, including for data mining and analytics.
Data collection technologies
We use Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies to provide you with a better experience when you use the Services. Data Collection Technologies help you log on to the Services, remember your settings and preferences, help us keep your information safe and secure, and enable our partners to serve ads for our products or Services, including those targeted to your interests.
For example, we partner with Google Analytics, who uses Cookies to track your interactions with our Services. Google then collects that information and reports it back to us. This information helps us improve our Services so that we can better serve users like you. For more information on Google Analytics, visit https://support.google.com/analytics.
Although most browsers and devices accept Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline Cookies. If you disable Cookies, some of the features of our Services may not function properly.
Interest Based Advertising : We may use vendors to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These advertising vendors may collect (through the use of Data Collection Technologies) information about your visits to and interactions with our Services. In addition, our vendors may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for any products and services available from us. If you would like more information about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/. To learn more about how to opt out of our interest-based advertising, please visit the “Your Choices” section below. CTCA will not serve targeted advertisements related specifically to cancer. For example, if you read an article on our Services about breast cancer, we will not serve you advertisements related to breast cancer. Our targeted advertisements are meant to target your general health- and wellness-related interests, such as health, exercise, and nutritional information. We also may serve general advertisements about CTCA and our treatment programs.
Third Party Advertising : We may use third-party features (e.g., social media sharing tools) or otherwise allow third parties to collect information about your use of the Services. We do not control how such third parties process information. To learn more about how to opt out of interest-based advertising that may be supported by third-party activities, please visit the “Your Choices” section below.
Use of Dynamic Phone Numbers : We may use dynamic number insertion (“DNI”) technology to assess the effectiveness of our Services and to optimize the content and customer service you receive. DNI technology involves randomly assigning a unique and dynamic phone number to your browser when you visit the Services. If you call that phone number, we and our DNI vendor will be able to link that phone number to: (1) the phone number you use to call us; and (2) certain Usage Information about your use of the Services. When you call a dynamic phone number, the information that we may link to it will become Protected Health Information and treated in accordance with our Notices of Privacy Practices.
Please note : Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature (“DNT”) that signals to the websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Our Services do not currently respond to web browser DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, please visit http://allaboutdnt.com.
When we share your information
We may share your information for the reason(s) disclosed to you at the time we collect it, with your consent as required, at your direction, as well as in the following ways:
With our vendors. We may share your Personal Information with our vendors as necessary to enable them to provide services to us. Vendors are third parties (other companies and individuals) that support the operation and maintenance of our Services and that have agreed to keep the Personal Information we share with them confidential.
With our commonly owned entities. We may share your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership and control of CTCA, as described in the definition of CTCA below. We do this in order to provide you better service, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience.

During a corporate transaction. If CTCA is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale, liquidation, or transfer of business or assets, information collected from and about users may be transferred to one or more third parties involved in such transaction and, upon such transfer, the relevant third party privacy policy or policies may govern further use of the information.
We reserve the right to share or sell Aggregate Information and other de-identified information (including metadata) to third parties for their own internal purposes, and publicly disclose such Aggregate Information and de-identified information, for example, in our marketing materials and research reports.

How we protect your information
The security of Personal Information is important to us. We use reasonable safeguards aimed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the Personal Information we collect and maintain. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Services.
Children's privacy rights
Neither CTCA nor any of its Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children under the age of thirteen.
