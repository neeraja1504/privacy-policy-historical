Privacy Policy
Cancercompass® respects the privacy of its users.
Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, and resources and services which are most relevant and helpful to you. To succeed in this aim, information is sometimes collected during your website visits to understand what differentiates you from each of our other users.
To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this statement disclosing the privacy practices for the entire Cancercompass.com website. Additional terms and conditions regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided on Cancercompass® from time to time. This information may change without notice.
This document provides the following information: what information is collected and how it might be used, including personally identifiable data; how we protect the data we collect and who will have access to it; and how you can correct inaccurate information.
What Information do we Collect?
Cancercompass® collects certain information from and about its users in two ways – directly from the User and from our Web server logs. None of the information that Cancercompass® collects is considered to be “protected health information” under HIPAA and its regulations, as this information is provided by you and is not gleaned from any medical records that are owned by any of our affiliates.
Shared Data
Some of the information that Users provide about themselves may be shared with the Cancercompass® community, Partners, and others (“Shared Data”). Examples of Shared Data that users may submit on thewebsite, including through their health profile (“My Profile”), may include:
Biographical information, e.g. photograph, biography, gender, age, location (city, state and country), general notes;
Condition/disease information that you have self-reported, e.g. diagnosis date, first symptom, family history;
Treatment information that you have self-reported, e.g. treatment start dates, stop dates, dosages, side effects, treatment evaluations;
Symptom information that you have self-reported, e.g. severity, duration;
Individual and aggregated survey responses;
Information shared via free text fields, e.g. the forum, treatment evaluations, surveys, annotations, journals, feeds, adverse event reports; and
Connections to other people on the Site
In the course of using this site, Users may share information that could be used to reasonably identify themselves (“Personal Information”), including name, photograph, and email address. When a User voluntarily chooses to share Personal Information via a free text field (e.g. forum, treatment evaluations, annotations, journals, feeds and adverse event reports) and photos or images, the information will be treated as Shared Data.
Links to other Website
Please note that if you use a link from our site to one of our partner's sites, our partner's use of any personal information collected from you during your use of that site, whether collected explicitly or automatically, will be governed by our partner's privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read our partner's online privacy policy, if available, or to contact the company directly about their privacy policy, before providing them with any personally-identifying information.
Restricted Data
Some information that Users enter into certain fields when registering for or using this website will not be shared (“Restricted Data”). The type of Restricted Data that Users may submit could include:
Name, as collected as part of registration or in a Member’s Account Information;
Email address, as collected and verified as part of registration or in a Member’s Account Information;
Password, as collected as part of registration or in a Member’s Account Information;
Mailing address, as collected via email, forms, or private message
Date of birth, as collected in My Profile; and
Private messages.
When a User enters Personal Information, including name and email address, as part of registering to use Cancercompass®, that Personal Information is treated as Restricted Data.
How Cancercompass.com uses your shared and restricted data
Users should expect that every piece of information they submit (even if it is not currently displayed), except for Restricted Data, might be shared with the community, other patients, and our Partners. Users are encouraged to share details of their health, but should consider that the more information entered, the more likely it is that a User could be located or identified.
There are instances where both Shared Data and Restricted Data, including Personal Information, may be used and disclosed. These include, but not limited to:
Cancercompass® uses both Shared Data and Restricted Data internally, as needed, for research, for maintenance and operation of the Site, and to create the best possible tools and functionality for patients.
In case of an emergency, Cancercompass® may use a User’s data to allow a member of the management team to directly contact the User.
Cancercompass® may share or disclose a User’s data where required by law or to comply with the legal process.

Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, even after you leave the webiste. Persistent Cookies also do not store any Personal Information either. Instead, they store preferences that should persist from visit to visit; for example, “Remember Me,” and a unique token to enable us to understand how our Users utilize our website.
Security Information:
When you visit an Internet website, you disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet [Protocol] (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a Cancercompass® page).

How We Protect Your Information
Your personal data and its privacy and protection is crucial to us. Therefore, Cancercompass® does not pass on personal information to any third parties without your permission. This may or may not change in the future without notification. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding your Cancercompass® usage are provided in aggregate form, which does not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.
Your access to some services and content is password protected. It is never a good idea to reveal your password to anyone. Cancercompass® will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you are contacted for your user name or password, please do not share it.
Additionally, when applicable, you should always sign out of your Cancercompass® account or service at the end of each session. It is also good practice to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This ensures that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you are using a shared computer with someone else, or are working from a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no one can completely guarantee the security of data transmitted over the Internet. So, despite our efforts to protect personal data by using the latest security technology, Cancercompass® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. All such information is submitted at your own risk. However, once a transmission is received, ensuring its safety and confidentiality on our systems are is of the highest priority.
