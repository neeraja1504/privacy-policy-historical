PRIVACY POLICY
Effective: July 27 th 2012
Welcome to AnalytixInsight Inc. (“AnalytixInsight”) owner of  www.capitalcube.com (the “Site”). Protecting your privacy is important to us. We collect and keep as little information as possible about you.
AnalytixInsight wants you to know what information we learn about you when you visit the Site, what we do with that information, and what choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
In no event shall you be entitled to any compensation for the use of any of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy applies to any information we collect on the Site, in e-mail or any other electronic messages between you and AnalytixInsight, and through mobile or desktop applications you download from this Site or any app store or third party provider, which allow for dedicated and non-browser based interactions between you and AnalytixInsight. Any information we collect offline, or any information collected by any third party accessible from or through the Site is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Security.  When you send confidential personal account data or sensitive data (such as credit card number) to us on our Site, we require that a “secure session” first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL is a security protocol for commercial transactions on the Internet. SSL uses public-key cryptography to authenticate Internet servers, to encrypt data, and to maintain the accuracy of transmitted data.
The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission an once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Information Collection.  When you visit our Site, we recognize only your apparent network address (IP address). Apart from when you register for an account with us, the only way we will see your personal information, such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address, is if you provide it to us by filling out a form or sending us an e-mail message . We use the information that you provide to us when you register on a page on this Site, fill out a survey, or otherwise voluntarily tell us about yourself or your activities for our own use to improve our products and services and the content of this site. You may also receive mailings or other communications from AnalytixInsight. We currently do not and intend to not sell or pass on any of your information to third parties. We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in our e-mails or by sending an e-mail message to us at notices@AnalytixInsight.com  telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from AnalytixInsight.
Our Site does, however, use “cookies” to collect information about how our site is used. See “ABOUT COOKIES” below. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer or Firefox), and whether you responded to a banner ad on our Site or e-mail, as well as any stored preferences of our registered users that may be stored in “cookies,” is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for purposes of measuring response rates to banner ads and e-mail offers, as well as for measuring and improving our Site and for providing Site analytics that may be useful for us to sell or develop our products, services or advertising to third parties.
Registration for Online Products and Services.  In order to provide you with a particular product or service online, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your e-mail address and credit card information, for purposes such as correspondence, Site registration, checking your account status online, making a purchase or participating in online surveys, and enabling us to provide an online product or service to you in an efficient manner. If you are known to us as a registered AnalytixInsight online customer, we may combine information about your use of our Site and the online product or service you utilize with certain other online and offline information we have about you as an AnalytixInsight customer and information you have provided to us as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data, in order to customize your online experience and present you with relevant online and offline offers and updates.
We also use a “cookie” to enable our server to recognize you as a registered AnalytixInsight online customer when you re-enter our Site, your email and password will be saved. You may turn off our cookies either in your browser settings or in your account settings without impeding the site’s functionality. If you turn off cookies entirely, the site will not recognize you as a registered AnalytixInsight online customer, and you may have to re-enter certain information.
Information Use.  We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, allow you to screen and research stocks, set up alerts, allow you to create or import portfolios, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various services and inform you about products and services. If you have provided your e-mail address to us or to a company we have partnered with to make their products and services available to you, we may send you e-mail offers. We may also send you e-mail offers if you have provided your e-mail address to a third party and have actively chosen or requested, on an opt-in basis, to receive e-mail offers from other parties. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. These e-mail offers come directly from AnalytixInsight. You can always opt out from receiving e-mail offers from AnalytixInsight as described below in the section, “DECLINING E-MAIL OFFERS.”
When we send e-mails to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich html e-mails. If your e-mail address is html-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich html e-mails.
Please note that we do not provide your e-mail address to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from an AnalytixInsight business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future offers from them.
Our goal is to deliver offers to people who we believe will find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information.
Declining E-mail, Direct Mail or Telemarketing Offers.  AnalytixInsight provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving e-mail, direct mail or telemarketing offers. Although some customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by changing your preferences in your account, or by following the link provided in any promotional email we send you or by emailing us at notices@AnalytixInsight.com. All e-mail, direct mail or telemarketing offers that you receive from AnalytixInsight will inform you of how to decline receiving further such offers.
Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider .  You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.    ****
