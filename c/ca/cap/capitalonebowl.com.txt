Download the Notice of Privacy Practices (pdf)
The privacy of your information is important and Harvard Pilgrim takes the protection of your information seriously.  We may collect, use, and disclose financial and medical information about you when doing business with you or with others.  We do this in accordance with Harvard Pilgrim’s privacy policies and applicable state and federal laws.  Harvard Pilgrim also requires its business partners who administer health care coverage to you on our behalf to protect your information in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.
Harvard Pilgrim must follow the duties and privacy practices described in this notice and give you a copy of it. We may make changes to this notice and our privacy practices at any time, as long as the changes are consistent with our current privacy policies and state and federal law. If we make an important change to our policies, we will notify you by mail or electronically as permitted by applicable law. We will also post the revised notice on our web site, www.harvardpilgrim.org. For members enrolled in a student health plan offered by HPHC Insurance Company and administered by UnitedHealthcare Student Resources, you may also access the revised notice at www.uhcsr.com. ** **
WHAT IS PERSONAL AND HEALTH INFORMATION?
Personal and health information (referred to as “information” elsewhere in this notice) includes protected health information (PHI) and individually identifiable information like your name and Social Security number. PHI is health information related to your physical or behavioral health condition used in providing health care to you or for payment for health care services.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We are required by law to maintain the privacy and security of all forms of information including electronic, written and verbal information.  We have procedures in place to ensure this, using physical and electronic safeguards, including storing information in restricted access electronic files and access-controlled workspaces. Harvard Pilgrim computers are protected through passwords and ongoing monitoring of security threats. All staff must complete annual privacy and security training, and access to information is limited to employees who require it to do their job.
TO WHOM WILL HARVARD PILGRIM DISCLOSE MY INFORMATION?
Harvard Pilgrim may disclose information to:
You, your family and others:
When you are unavailable to communicate, such as during an emergency.
When you are present prior to the disclosure and you agree to it.
When you have previously indicated an individual is your designated representative.
When the information is clearly relevant to their authorized involvement with your health care or payment for health care. For example, we may confirm a claim has been received or paid if an individual has prior knowledge of the claim.
When sharing copayment, coinsurance, and deductible information with subscribers for dependents in order to facilitate management of health costs and Internal Revenue Service verification.
When sharing a minor’s information with parents or guardians who have custodial rights, so long as that information is not further restricted by applicable state or federal laws. Information related to any care a minor may receive without parental consent remains confidential unless the minor authorizes disclosure.
Your providers and others involved in your care:
For quality initiatives, safety concerns and coordination of care. Examples include state-mandated quality improvement initiatives, results of laboratory tests not otherwise restricted by law, and clinical reminders sent to your primary care provider.
Your employer-sponsored health benefit plan administrator.
Your plan sponsor, when sharing data used for enrollment and plan renewal. This is your employer or their representatives, if you are enrolled through an employer.
When providing detailed claims and other health plan information to your plan sponsor, after receiving appropriate certifications that the plan sponsor agrees to protect your privacy and the information will not be used for employment decisions. For example, supporting an employer’s efforts to design and develop a wellness program for employees by sharing results of screening tests offered for evaluating common medical conditions and responses to health status questionnaires employees may elect to complete and submit.
Our business associates and business partners:
Harvard Pilgrim may contract with other organizations to provide services on our behalf. In these cases, Harvard Pilgrim will enter into an agreement with the organization explicitly outlining the requirements associated with the protection, use and disclosure of your information.
HOW WILL HARVARD PILGRIM USE AND DISCLOSE MY INFORMATION?
In order to provide coverage for treatment and to pay for those services, we need to use and disclose your information in several different ways. Harvard Pilgrim maintains and enforces company policies governing the use and disclosure of information. Our staff is trained to handle your information appropriately and to only use information required for their roles. The following are examples of the types of uses and disclosures we are permitted to make without your authorization:
For payment
Harvard Pilgrim will use and disclose your information to administer your health benefits. This may involve the determination of eligibility, claims payment, utilization review activities, medical necessity review, coordination of benefits, appeals, and external review requests. Examples include:
Paying claims that were submitted to us by physicians and hospitals.
Transmitting information to a third party to facilitate administration of a Flexible Spending Account, a Health Savings Account, a Health Reimbursement Account, or a dental benefits plan.
For health care operations
Harvard Pilgrim may use and disclose your information for operational purposes, such as care management, customer service, coordination of care or quality improvement. Examples include:
Assessing the quality of “service, care and outcomes” for our members
Learning how to improve our services through the use of internal and external surveys
Reviewing and credentialing our affiliated physicians and institutions
Evaluating the performance of our staff, such as reviewing our customer service representatives’ phone conversations with you
Seeking accreditation by independent organizations, such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance
Engaging in wellness programs, preventive health, early detection, disease management, health risk assessment participation initiatives, case management, and coordination of care programs, including sending preventive health service reminders
Using information for underwriting, establishing premium rates and determining cost sharing amounts, as well as administration of reinsurance (Harvard Pilgrim will not use or disclose any genetic information it might otherwise receive for underwriting purposes.)
Facilitating transition of care from and to other insurers, health plans or third party administrators
Other general administrative activities, including data and information systems management, risk management, auditing, and detection of fraud and other unlawful conduct
For treatment
Harvard Pilgrim may disclose your information to health care providers (doctors, dentists, pharmacies, hospitals and other caregivers) in connection with your treatment. Examples include:
Quality improvement and cost containment wellness programs, preventive health initiatives, early detection programs, safety initiatives, and disease management programs. This may include disclosing a list of medications you’ve received using your Harvard Pilgrim coverage to alert your treating physicians about any medications prescribed to you by other providers and help minimize potential adverse drug interactions.
To administer quality-based cost-effective care models. For example, if you receive your treatment through an “Accountable Care Organization” or a “Medical Home”, a setting in which team-based care is led by your physician, Harvard Pilgrim may share information with the Accountable Care Organization or Medical Home providers about the services you receive elsewhere to assure coordination of effective and high quality care.
Harvard Pilgrim may receive your test results from labs you use, from your providers, or directly from you. These results may be used to develop tools to improve your overall health, and may be shared with providers involved in your care.
For other permitted or required purposes
The following are examples of the additional types of uses and disclosures Harvard Pilgrim is permitted or required by law to make without your authorization:
To provide information for health services research to improve the health of our members and the Harvard Pilgrim may use your information for research purposes when our Human Subjects Committee has reviewed the research proposal and approved the research based on established protocols to ensure your privacy.
To comply with laws and regulations, such as those related to Workers’ Compensation.
For public health and safety activities, such as assisting public health authorities with disease prevention or disease control or for notification purposes during disaster relief efforts. This can include data collection by state government-mandated or -sponsored consortiums or public health authorities.
For health oversight activities , such as submitting information to a government agency authorized to oversee the health care system or government programs, or to its contractors. Examples include the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a state insurance department or the U.S. Department of Labor for activities authorized by law, such as audits, examinations, investigations, inspections, and licensure activity.
For judicial or administrative proceedings , including responses to court orders, subpoenas , discovery requests or other lawful process.
To funeral directors or coroners so they can carry out their lawful duties. Harvard Pilgrim may also disclose information about a decedent to the executor, administrator, or other person with authority to act on behalf of the decedent’s estate.

To report information related to victims of abuse or neglect.
To prevent a serious threat to your health or safety, or that of another person
For specialized government functions , such as for national security and intelligence activities. In addition, under certain conditions, we may disclose your information if you are or were a member of the Armed Forces, for those activities deemed necessary by appropriate military.
For inmates, to a correctional institution or a law enforcement official having lawful custody, if the provision of such information is necessary to provide you with health care, protect your health and safety, and that of others, or maintain the safety and security of the correctional institution.

Fraud, waste and abuse
You can help us to detect and prevent health care fraud and abuse.  It is important that you review activity statements, explanation of benefits and claim summaries to ensure that you actually received the services that are billed to Harvard Pilgrim.  Here are some examples of potential fraud and abuse:
Bills for health care services that were never provided
Bills for a higher level of service than you actually received
Bills for services or laboratory testing that you feel were not medically necessary
Providers who agree to routinely waive large cost-sharing obligations without requesting financial documentation
Providers who bill you for cost-sharing amounts that are greater than the obligations listed on your explanation of benefits forms
A request to loan your member ID card to others for the purpose of getting health care services or prescription drugs
Receiving medications, cream, or durable medical equipment through the mail as a result of a phone solicitation
For more information about fraud and abuse, review Harvard Pilgrim’s  Fraud, waste and abuse policy (pdf) .
To report potential health care fraud and abuse, or if you have questions, please call our confidential hotline number at (877) 548-6712.  You are not required to provide your name or member information; anonymous reporting is accepted.  You can also send an anonymous letter to us at:
