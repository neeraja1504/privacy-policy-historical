Sharing of your Personal Data
1. With other entities of the group
** ** Capgemini is a global organisation. Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g., country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and infrastructure are international in scope and nature and generally cross-country borders. Accordingly, you should be aware that we may share your personal data with other entities of Capgemini and transfer it to countries in the world where we have data centres or otherwise do business, including those located outside the European Union (EU). Such data transfers will be covered by our Binding Corporate Rules (Capgemini BCR) which were approved by European Data Protection Authorities in 2016.

Whenever we rely on such third parties, we make sure that they provide an adequate level of protection to the personal data they process on our behalf and when such third parties are located out of the European Union, we make sure that we enter into European Model Clauses as adopted by the European Commission. You can obtain a copy of the said EU Model Clauses by contacting us at dpocapgemini.global@capgemini.com.

Business Reorganisations
Like many organisations, Capgemini may reorganise its business operations around the world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging existing businesses.
