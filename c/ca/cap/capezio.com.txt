If we learn that we have received information from an individual under the age of 18, we will use that information only to respond to that individual that he or she cannot use Capezio.com site and we will delete that information from our servers.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Our visitors - Automatic Data Collection
Like most websites, Capezio.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Capezio's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use this website. From time to time, Capezio may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this website.
Capezio also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Capezio does not use such information to identify visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that Capezio uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Our customers - Information You Provide to Us
Certain actions on the Capezio.com website do require us to collect personally-indentifying information. Purchasers are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, Capezio collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with the Capezio company. We will never disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Aggregated Statistics
Capezio may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Capezio may monitor the most popular sections or products on the site. Capezio may display this non-personally-identifying information publicly or provide it to others. However, Capezio does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Capezio discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Capezio's behalf or to provide services requested by the customer, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Capezio.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Capezio will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Capezio discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Capezio believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Capezio, third parties or the public at large. Capezio takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
