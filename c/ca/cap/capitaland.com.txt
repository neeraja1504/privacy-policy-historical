CapitaLand Group's Personal Data Protection Policy
Personal Data Protection is important to us
Protection of your Personal Data is important to us. This CapitaLand Personal Data Protection Policy (“ Policy ”) outlines how we manage the Personal Data we hold. The Policy applies to all departments and business units across the CapitaLand Group. CapitaLand Limited (Reg. No. 198900036N), and/or its related corporations and affiliates (referred to hereunder as “CapitaLand”, the “CapitaLand Group”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collectively or singularly as the context requires, recognise the importance of protecting Personal Data.
We respect the confidentiality of Personal Data and privacy of individuals and are committed to complying with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (Act 26 of 2012) (“ PDPA ”) and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union (“ EU ”) General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”) where applicable. Please read this Policy so that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Data.
We adopt a pragmatic “Data- light , Data- tight ” approach in our business conduct.
“Data- light ” means that we collect Personal Data only for what is required in business or in activities conducted by our organisation and will properly destroy the Personal Data once there is no business or legal purpose. We do not collect Personal Data randomly or indiscriminately without purpose.
“Data- tight ” means that we do not disclose your Personal Data unless prior consent has been obtained and we have administrative, physical and Information Technology (IT) security measures to protect your Personal Data.
This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights which any member of the CapitaLand Group may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data. This Policy does not affect any rights which we may have at law in connection with the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, nothing in this Policy establishes any joint and several liability on the part of the CapitaLand Group members.
1.             Your Personal Data
1.1.         “ Personal Data ” refers to any data or information about you from which you can be identified either (a) from that data alone; or (b) from that data combined with other information.

a)            your name, national registration identification number, passport number or other identification number, telephone number(s), mailing address, email address, facial image in a photograph or video recording, fingerprint and any other information relating to you which you have provided us in any form you may have submitted to us, or in other forms of interaction with you;

In addition, as described above, in carrying out our business, it may be necessary to share information about you with and between our related corporations and affiliates, and third party service providers, some of which may be located in countries outside your country of residence. Such countries may not afford a standard of protection similar to those in your country of residence. However, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data transmitted outside of your country of residence is adequately protected. In addition, we will ensure that such transfers comply with the requirements of the applicable data protection laws.
4.2        In respect of our activities in EU, where your Personal Data is transferred to locations outside the European Economic Area, we have entered into a special type of contract (called European Commission Model Contractual Clauses) with the recipients of your Personal Data to ensure that they will provide adequate levels of protection for your Personal Data.

c)            where the processing of your Personal Data is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to demand transmission to another controller;
d)            in certain circumstances, you can request to have your Personal Data deleted or restrict the processing of it;
e)                  if we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is necessary for legal reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing purposes, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or by contacting us at the details provided in paragraph 12.1 below;
f)             prevent any processing of Personal Data that is causing or is likely to cause unwarranted and substantial damage or distress to you or another individual;

If you are located in the EU, you can contact the supervisory authority in the EU member state of your habitual residence or place of work or where the relevant member of the CapitaLand Group which has used your Personal Data is located.
6.2       Where we rely on your consent to use your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This withdrawal will however not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.
If you withdraw your consent to any or all purposes and depending on the nature of your request, we may not be in a position to continue to provide our products or services to you. Please note, however, that if you have provided us consent in respect of the use of your Singapore telephone number(s) for receiving marketing or promotional information, any such consent provided will not be affected by your withdrawal of your other consent in accordance with the terms set out in this Policy.  If you do not wish for your Singapore telephone number(s) to be used for receiving marketing or promotional information, please contact the relevant Data Protection Officer and specify that you wish to withdraw your consent for such purpose.
6.3 **        Where we process your Personal Data based on the legitimate interests referred to in paragraph 3.3 above, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is necessary for legal reasons. **
6.4       Where mandated under the applicable data protection laws, your exercise of the rights described or referred to above shall be free of charge. In all other situations, we may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying the request and locating, retrieving and copying any material requested.
