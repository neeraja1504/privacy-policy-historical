Particular pages of this Site may contain notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages. Certain portions of this Site may contain notices advising you that different policies and practices apply to the information collected through those particular portions of this Site, in which case those different policies and practices will supersede this Policy. These additional notices are referred to as "Privacy Notices" in this Policy.
If you are a learner (or are applying to become a learner) at Capella, your personal information may also be protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). The provisions of FERPA supercede and govern over any contrary provisions in this Policy. Learn more about FERPA and Capella's FERPA Compliance Program.
This Policy does not cover any employees, faculty, contractors, consultants, or agents of Capella.

What Information Is Collected on this Site and How Is It Used?
When you access and use this Site, there are three ways we may collect information about you:
1. ** Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily Provide.**
Capella collects the information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Site, for example, the information you provide when you request information or a University Guide, complete a survey, or e-mail us with questions or feedback. In many cases, this information will identify you personally.
Capella uses the personal information you volunteer through this Site to provide the information, services and products you request. For example, we use the information you provide when you request a University Guide to deliver the University Guide to you, and we use your e-mail address to respond to your comments or questions.
We may also use your contact information to follow up with you after you have expressed an interest in our programs. For example, after we send you our University Guide, we may telephone you to see if you have questions. We respect your privacy, however. If your telephone number is on a "Do Not Call" list, we will send you an e-mail requesting permission to call you and will only do so with your consent.
Unless you have "opted-out," we will add your contact information to our mailing lists and from time to time we will send you newsletters or updates, special offers, or other information about programs, services and products we believe would be of interest to you. You may "opt out" of receiving this information from us at any time by calling us at 1-888-CAPELLA (1-888-227-3552) option 3. If you are receiving e-mail from us and wish to unsubscribe, please click on the unsubscribe link provided in the e-mail you receive from us.
If we provide promotional information or materials to you by e-mail, we will include a link to our "opt-out" page in every e-mail.
Finally, we may study the personal information collected through this Site to improve our programs and services, to improve the content, functionality, navigation, and usability of this Site; to better understand the needs and interests of learners, alumni, and the other constituencies we serve; and to better market our programs, services, and products. We may also remove all the personally identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical, or scientific purposes.
2. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser
Capella collects information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or Macintosh®), and the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your Web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. Unless you access this Site through an e-mail we have sent you or have created a "user identity" by creating an account during one of your visits, this information will not be linked to information that identifies you personally. We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors.
3. Information Collected By Placing a "Cookie" On Your Computer
Capella may obtain information about you by installing a cookie on your computer's hard drive. A cookie is a piece of Web code that is used primarily for one or more of the following: analysis of Web site traffic and user behavior, application functionality, and data storage. We use two types of cookies: "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."
We use "session cookies" to assign a randomly-generated unique identification number to your computer. A session cookie does not identify you personally, and expires (i.e., is automatically deleted from your computer) after you close your browser. We use session cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our site — which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "clickstream data") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of our sites. We do not link this information with any information that identifies you personally.
We use "persistent cookies" (cookies that do not expire when you close your browser) for several purposes. Like session cookies, they are used to assign a unique identifier to your computer, but because they are persistent, they permit us to recognize your computer each time you use it to access the Site. By using persistent cookies, we can collect and analyze clickstream data from more than one visit to the Site. Cookies are also used to store information you have previously provided such as your user ID or shipping address that can be displayed back to you automatically each time you visit the Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or until they expire. Expiration durations vary and are set by Capella.
Finally, both types of cookies (persistent and session) are occasionally used to facilitate the proper functioning of our applications and features of the Site.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the Site if your browser rejects our cookies.
Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies by Our Third-Party Ad Servers
Capella uses reputable third-party advertising companies to present ("serve") ads on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to help present and better target our advertisements, to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements, or to customize the content of the advertisements presented to you. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's browser that can be used to help recognize you as someone who may be interested in online learning. Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other things, to deliver a cookie to the browser of a computer accessing that page. More information about our third-party ad servers, the technologies they use, and how you can disable or "opt-out" from receiving their cookies.
Sometimes Capella uses third party advertising companies to help us with our e-mail marketing campaigns. These third-party advertising companies may include cookies in the e-mails they send on our behalf. These cookies do not identify you personally. They do not track your use of the Internet or cause pop-up ads to appear. They are used to help the Web sites you visit recognize you as someone with an interest in online education and to customize the content of the ads presented to you. Your browser can not screen out cookies that are sent by e-mail, but you can easily disable these cookies by visiting the ad server's Web site and following the instructions posted there. View links to our ad server's Web sites.
The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these third party advertising companies is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy policy.
Does Capella Share My Personal Data?
Capella may share personal information collected through this Site with companies and organizations who perform certain functions on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services (such as third-party advertising companies and colleges with whom we have referral relationships). These third parties are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. To learn which third-party service providers we use, please contact us at 612-977-5662 . Learn more about the ways our third-party advertising companies use cookies and other technologies to increase the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
There are other limited circumstances in which Capella may share or transfer the personal information in our databases to unrelated third parties. For example, we may provide personal information to a third party when we believe it is necessary to comply with U.S. Department of Education reporting requirements or the reporting requirements of accrediting bodies; to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to comply with a court order or subpoena; to comply with a legal requirement; to enforce a contract; to protect the rights, property, or safety of Capella, our users or others; to protect your vital interests; or in connection with a corporate sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar event. In particular, we exchange personal information in our databases with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes. When we disclose information under these or similar circumstances, we will take appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.
How Does Capella Protect Personal Information?
Although Capella cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal information, we take measures to prevent such occurrences. Our servers and databases are protected by firewalls and passwords. In addition, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt data as it travels between your computer and our servers. When you see a solid key or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, this indicates that your transmission will be protected by SSL technology.
Does Capella Collect Personal Information From Children Through This Site?
Capella does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen through this Site. If you are under thirteen, please do not give us any information that identifies you personally. If you have reason to believe that your child has provided personal information to Capella through this Site, please contact us, and we will use reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.
What About Other Sites That May Be Linked To This Site?
This Site contains links to other Web sites operated by Capella. This Site also contains links to Web sites that are owned and operated by unrelated third parties. For example, this Site contains links to a wide spectrum of resources that may be useful to Learners. In addition, this Site contains links to Web sites operated by third parties who provide services to Capella. For example, Capella uses a third-party service provider to process credit card transactions. If you wish to make a payment by credit card, we will ask you to click on a link that will take you to our service provider's Web sites.
This Privacy Statement applies only to personal information collected through this Site. It does not apply to personal information collected on any other Web sites operated by Capella, nor to personal information collected on our service providers' or other third-party Web sites. When you access other Web sites through a link on this Site, please take a few minutes to review the terms of use and privacy statement posted on each Web site you visit.
