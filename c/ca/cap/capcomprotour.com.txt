1. #### Data You Provide to Us
We collect and store the personal information you provide us when purchasing, registering, or using the CMV Apps, when you inquire about CMV Tournaments, products and services, and when you sign up for our events (including via Tournament Servicers), promotions, and mailing lists.

2. #### Data We Collect Automatically
CMV automatically collects and stores certain technical, app-related, and customer purchase information. Most of this information is non-personal, which means that this information by itself cannot be used to identify you; but this data may be used to identify you when combined with other information. This information includes:

* Additional information about your device, such as device name, operating system, browser type and language;
* Platform data, including purchase history and other information related to the Google Play Store or iOS App Store; and
* Location data (based on your IP address and telecommunications provider).
3. #### Data We Collect From our Partners
* Data from a third-party tool or SNS, if you link it with the Service (e.g., Facebook or Google);

* Data we use to investigate and prevent fraud such as click-fraud or fraudulent refunds or rebates; and
* Data related to analytics and advertising, in order to provide you with access to better apps and Services.
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Generally, we use your information to provide you with an efficient and customized experience. For example, we may use information in the following ways to provide you the Services:

* To send “push” notifications to your mobile device regarding CMV Apps that you have been using (for example, suggesting that you open the CMV Apps to take certain actions);
* To provide in-app information regarding upcoming CMV Tournaments, other events or achievements;
* To identify and suggest connections with other CMV users or users of an SNS that you use in connection with a CMV App;
* To enable communications between you and other CMV users or users of an SNS that you use in connection with a CMV App;
* To allow us to enable you to reset your password if you have forgotten it;
* To provide technical support and respond to inquiries from you;
* To prevent fraud and potentially illegal activities and enforce our Terms of Service;
* To monitor the performance of our third-party vendors and distributors; and

To exercise this right, you may do so by contacting us as provided in the “Contact” link below.
If we send e-mail or SMS messages to you for the purpose of promoting CMV events, products or services, or those of a third-party partner, we will generally provide you with choices about receiving further such promotional messages. Preferences for “push” notifications may in most cases be adjusted through the applicable CMV App or your mobile device.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW LONG WE KEEP IT

By registering with your SNS login information, you allow CMV to access certain information from your profile for that SNS.
