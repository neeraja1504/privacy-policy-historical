• Q1. What information does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on or through the Services offered to you by Capcom USA, and to information shared with Capcom USA by certain third parties (as further described in this Privacy Policy). It does not apply to any other information collected by Capcom USA through any other means.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected via the Internet, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Capcom via offline means. Further, this Privacy Policy applies only to the Services offered and maintained by Capcom USA, and not to any websites, services, games and/or applications offered and/or maintained by our international affiliates (e.g., Capcom Media Ventures, Capcom Asia, Capcom Europe, and Capcom Japan), or, unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, any other companies or organizations to which we link. Capcom USA is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those websites, except as expressly provided in this Privacy Policy.
Third-Party Websites
Once you have clicked on an advertisement or a third-party link on our site and have left our websites or other Services, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser/third party to see how your information will be collected and processed on its website.
Please note that the Capcom merchandise and apparel store (accessible at http://shop.capcom.com/) is a third-party website operating under license from Capcom USA, and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Specifically, all personal information, including purchase information, collected through the Capcom store is collected and used by Scalefast, Inc. pursuant to the privacy policy that governs that store (the “Scalefast Privacy Policy,” available at https://store.capcom.com/us/docs/privacy), which we encourage you to review carefully. You may reach out to Scalefast directly with any questions you have regarding their privacy practices by visiting https://www.scalefast.com/#contact-modal.Pursuant to the Scalefast Privacy Policy, Scalefast shares all information collected from consumers of the Capcom store with Capcom USA.

All information shared with Capcom USA originating from the Capcom store is handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

• Q2. What types of information do we collect about you?
Capcom respects your privacy, and, accordingly, we strive to minimize our collection of your personal information. Personal information is information that can be used to directly or indirectly with other collected information identify and contact you. If required by applicable law, Capcom will request your specific consent prior to collecting any of your personal information. If you prefer, however, not to disclose your personal information to Capcom, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Services.
Our Services and European Economic Area Users
Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and processing personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:
Specific Affirmative Consent: As stated above, Capcom will request your specific affirmative consent, if required by applicable law, in a clear, concise, and specific manner prior to collecting and processing your personal information.
Performance of Contract: In some instances, we will need to collect your personal information to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services to you (e.g., pursuant to our End User License Agreement for a Service), such as by collecting your IP address to facilitate matchmaking in an online multiplayer video game, or collecting your telemetry data to display your player statistics and rankings to you.
Legal Compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and process your personal information. For example, a court may order us to process your data for a particular purpose other than for which it was initially collected.
Legitimate Interests: On occasion, we may collect and process your personal information when we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. In other words, we may collect and process your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
Our Services and Children
We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from users under in the United States, and under the applicable age of consent in other countries ("Child" or "Children") other than as permitted by law, for example, in support of our internal operations (in the U.S.) and legitimate interests or contractual or legal obligations (in the EU). We take Children's privacy seriously and encourage parents to play an active role in their Children's online experience at all times.
If Capcom learns that a Child's personal information has been collected, we will delete the account. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their Child's personal information, they should contact us to request the deletion of the information.

Information Collected Through Third Party Services
i. Information Collected Through Social Networking Services
YYou can engage with our Services on or through third party social networking websites, such as Facebook, Twitch and Twitter, or other third party social media plug-ins and applications which may be hosted on separate websites or embedded within or integrated with our Services. Where practicable, we will provide clear notice before you are directed to a third party social networking website, plug-in, or application. When you engage with our Services on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may authorize us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the "likes" you make) to deliver content or as part of the operation of the Service. We may also obtain non-personal information from your interaction with our Services (e.g., content viewed, game performance and scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on).
By engaging with our Services on and through social networking websites, you consent to the sharing of such personal information with Capcom in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that when you provide personal information to us through social networking websites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of those social networking websites, and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties. Further, any use of third party social networking websites, plug-ins, or applications will be subject to such third party social network’s respective terms of service and privacy policy, and may result in the collection of information about your use of our Services by those third parties.
ii. Information Collected Through First Party Platforms
You can also engage with certain portions of our Services through certain first-party and/or mobile platforms (the “First Party Platform(s)”). For instance, if you desire to use features of our Services by signing in through or otherwise linking with, for example, your PSN account or Steam account to authenticate yourself, some information from those First Party Platforms (e.g., your account ID, date of birth/age, username, language preference, entitlement information, achievement/trophy information, and/or geographic information), and/or information regarding your usage of our Services (e.g., web analytics data or game telemetry data) (collectively, the “Platform Information”), which may have been collected by the First Party Platform may be transmitted to Capcom. Further, some First Party Platforms, such as mobile platform providers, may provide to us additional information such as your precise location or contact list information. We will collect this information only if you provide your affirmative consent.
Where required by applicable law, Capcom will request your specific affirmative consent prior to collecting and processing any Platform Information. Otherwise, by signing in and/or linking with a First Party Platform in connection with your use of the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Platform Information may be transmitted to us and that all Platform Information transmitted to us may be used by Capcom in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any applicable terms of consent required by a First Party Platform provider. Further, your use of the First Party Platform will be subject to such First Party Platforms’ respective terms of service and privacy policy.
Information Collected Through Cookies and Other Web-Based Technologies
We collect information through web-based technologies, such as “cookies”, to make our Services more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you use one of our Services, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. At times, we use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites. At other times, we collect your IP address to facilitate location-based matchmaking in our online multiplayer Services.
i. Cookies
Our web-based Services use cookies. A cookie is a small file consisting of letters and numbers that is downloaded to and stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Each cookie is unique to your web browser or device. There are several different types of cookies:
Session cookies, which only last as long as your visit to the website. Session cookies are used for things such as remembering what you put into your shopping cart as you browse a website, or to ensure that your bank account information cannot be accessed after you leave the bank’s website.
Persistent cookies, which last for a longer period of time, including in between sessions. Persistent cookies are used for things like remembering your preferences and choices when you re-visit a website, or for keeping you logged in to a website.
First- and third-party cookies, which refer to who is placing the cookie on your computer or device. First-party cookies are placed by the website that you are visiting; third-party cookies are placed by a third-party, such as an advertising company that is posting ads on the website that you are visiting.
We use the cookies for the following purposes:
Strictly necessary functionality: We use several persistent cookies that are strictly necessary to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, we would not be able to provide certain functions of our sites, such as automatic sign-in to Capcom-Unity.
To provide additional functionality: To remember the setting you’ve chosen to use when viewing our site, and to tailor our site to you. For example, if you set your location to France, we know to translate the site into the French language for you.
Analytical or Performance purposes: To measure visitor behavior, such as how many times a visitor visits the site, so that we can improve our site and provide you a better experience.
Depending on your choice of browser (e.g., Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), you may be able to modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it. Alternatively, you can refuse to accept cookies altogether, and you can also delete cookies that have already been set. You can do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your settings. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.
To support our web pages, we sometimes also embed content from third-party websites, such as video content from YouTube. As a result, when you visit a page containing such content, you will be presented with third-party cookies from these third-party websites. Similarly, you will also see embedded ‘share’ buttons on Capcom web pages that enable users to easily share content with their friends through a number of popular social networks. When you click on one of these buttons, a cookie will be set by the service through which you have chosen to share content (such as Facebook or Twitter). Capcom does not control the placement of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party's website for more information on how to restrict the placement of these cookies. When visiting Capcom's websites, the third-party cookies that may be present include, but are not limited to those listed in the chart below.

Enable online matchmaking and provide online statistic tracking;
Help you find your friends or tell your friends about a Service;
Facilitate sharing on social networks;
Serve and measure the effectiveness of advertising;
Measure the health of our Services;

To provide you support, including to:
Help identify and troubleshoot problems with your use of our Services;
To survey your opinions through surveys or questionnaires;
Communicate with you and respond to your specific requests or questions; and
Manage and send you confirmations and important information about your account, products, purchases, subscriptions, and warranties.
To personalize our communications with you, including to:
Present offers and/or information relating to Services you might like;
Make recommendations to you; and
Personalize advertising for you and deliver targeted marketing newsletters, service updates and promotional offers.
Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect and process your information to the extent you have provided to us your affirmative consent, or, alternatively, as reasonably necessary to fulfill our contracts with you, perform our legitimate business objectives, or as otherwise required under applicable law. More importantly, we will not collect and use your personal information for any purposes other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy without your affirmative consent.
Capcom USA Activities and Updates
Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like newsletter subscriptions, updates on special events, game news, and e-mail announcements of interest to our users, as well as providing our users with exclusive content, awards, prizes and/or access to special promotions. You may opt out of such services by following the process set forth in Q8 below.
Forums, Blogs, and Message Boards
If you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. You should understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community. So whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.
Should you wish to remove content or information after you have posted it, you may do so by logging into your Capcom account and clicking either the "garbage can" or "x" icon located on your post. Alternatively, you may contact us at privacy@capcom.com with your request. In addition, Capcom provides all registered users the ability permanently delete their account information including all comments, blogs, and forum posts. To delete your Capcom-Unity account, please log in and visit this link: http://www.capcom-unity.com/help/remove_user.one. Please note that deleting your profile cannot be reversed.
Please also note that removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers if we have a legal basis for doing so. For example, we are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are ordered by a court to retain it. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have copied or reposted this information.
Operational Uses
We may also use your personal information for other purposes, such as operational uses necessary to conduct our business or provide the Services. For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Services.
Aggregated and Anonymous Information
Finally, we may take your personal information and make it anonymous. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name or other identifying information) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your personal information. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.
Employment-Related Information
For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in an employment context different from information we receive in other contexts. Personal information submitted to us in an employment context (e.g., employment applications and resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.
Purchase or Sale of Businesses
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personal information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personal information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, to the maximum extent possible. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personal information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.
Third Party Processing
Capcom engages third parties, located both within and outside of the United States, to collect and/or process your personal information on our behalf in connection with our offering and maintenance of the Services, such as for providing back-end server/matchmaking services, customer support services, analytics services, conducting market surveys, or sending newsletters, or otherwise in accordance with the purpose(s) for which your personal information was originally collected. When these third party service providers collect or receive your personal information, we require that they use your personal information only on our behalf, not sell your personal information to third parties, not disclose your personal information except as may be required by law, or as permitted by us or as stated in this Privacy Policy.
To the extent that your personal information may be transferred to countries outside of the United States, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your personal information remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy.
No Third Party Marketing
Our company does not share and has not reserved the right to rent or sell your personal or demographic information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Automated Decision Making
Capcom does not use your personal information in any form of automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you, or similarly significantly affects you.
Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Services and Others
We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or to help:
enforce our Terms of Service, or contest, sweepstakes, eSports tournaments, promotions, or game rules;
protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or
protect the safety and security of our Services or third parties.

• Q5. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have technical, administrative and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. But, despite our best efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. Specific security measures we currently implement to prevent unauthorized physical or electronic access to users' personal and demographic information:
User data is stored behind a firewall to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration
Data is stored in a secure physical environment (e.g. behind locked doors)
Data is stored in a database accessible to authorized employees on a need-to-know basis only
Users or employees must have a unique password before gaining access to user data
We use industry standard encryption technology when transferring or receiving sensitive personal information
We maintain written security policies to which all employees must adhere.

For personal information transferred from a European Union or European Economic Area member country or Switzerland to the United States, Capcom complies with the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Capcom certifies that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Capcom commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European Union, European Economic Area and/or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy should contact us at privacy@capcom.com, or regular mail at:

Attn.: Privacy Policy Administrator
185 Berry Street, Suite 1200

If a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss individual’s complaint cannot be resolved through our internal process, we will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules, available on the JAMS website. Mediation shall be conducted in English and shall take place in the City and County of San Francisco in the State of California before one mediator selected in accordance with such rules and procedures. All documents submitted to such mediation shall be in English. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the relevant JAMS rules, and at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss individual may also pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. Arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures set forth in Privacy Shield Annex I. Any arbitration not before the Privacy Shield Panel shall be conducted in English and shall take place in the City and County of San Francisco in the State of California before one arbitrator. All documents submitted to such arbitration shall be in English.
Additionally, at any time, a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss individual may submit a complaint directly to his or her local European Union data protection authority or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable. Moreover, Capcom is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. For more information about filing a complaint, click here.
Capcom may be liable for the onward transfer of EU, EEA or Swiss individual’s personal data to third parties that process personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Capcom proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
