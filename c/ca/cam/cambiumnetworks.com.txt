Effective Date: May 25, 2018
Overview
Cambium Networks, Ltd. and our subsidiaries (collectively “Cambium Networks”) respect the privacy of individuals who provide us with their personal information, including our customers, resellers, distributors, service providers and visitors to our website, as well as information derived from applications, devices, software, tools and other services provided by us.  This Privacy Policy (the “ Policy ”) explains how we collect, use and disclose personal information and other information of users, with respect to access to and use of:
The web site or web pages located at www.cambiumnetworks.com/ or any other web site or web pages owned or operated by Cambium Networks, including our community forum located at http://community.cambiumnetworks.com/, our partner portals located at https://channel.cambiumnetworks.com/, and our support site located at http://support.cambiumnetworks.com (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”).
Our network life cycle management services provided through our cnMaestro™ product at https://cloud.cambiumnetworks.com as well as our LinkPlanner™ and Wireless Manager™ network planning products; and
Any other solutions or services provided by us or in connection with access to or through use of our products, network, devices, software or Sites (collectively, with our life cycle management and planning services, the “Services”).
If you choose to use our products or Services, you acknowledge this Policy. Before you access any Sites, purchase or use Cambium Networks products or Services, or provide any non-public information to us, you should review this Privacy Policy to understand our information collection and use practices.  The terms “you”, “your,” and “user” refer to a user visiting the Site or accessing or using the Services, including any personnel or other user that accesses or uses our products or Services on behalf of a business customer, reseller, or distributor.  Other capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meanings given to them in Cambium Networks’ Terms of Use.  This Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Sites or Services.
If you are in the European Economic Area, the data controller for the purposes of European data protection law is Cambium Networks, Ltd., Unit B2, Linhay Business Park, Eastern Road, Ashburton, Devon, United Kingdom TQ13 7UP.  For some Services, we also act as a service provider (or data processor) on behalf of our customers when they incorporate our Services and products into their own solutions; where we act as a service provider, our customer’s privacy policy will govern, not this Policy.  This Policy does not govern websites of other parties to which we may provide links.
Information We Collect
We may collect information directly from you, as well as automatically through your use of our Sites or Services.  For example, when you contact us or when a device connects to one of our products or when you use one of our Services, we automatically collect information, including in connection with use of our Services and, in some cases, information about the devices connected to or by our products.
Registration Information _.  _You can browse many areas of our Sites and use many of our Services without registering with us or providing us your name or contact info.  However, to access certain Services or content on the Sites, we may ask you to register or provide certain information to us, including name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, promotional preferences, and passphrases and passcodes to facilitate the log-on functionality.  We collect this type of personal information, as follows:
When you register on one of our Sites, including setting up an account for support, training, or software downloads, or access certain Services from us (including our life cycle management services provided by  cn Maestro™ and network planning services through LinkPlanner™ or Wireless Manager™), we collect information including the user’s name, job title, company, email address, telephone number and location.
When you download software updates, we may collect information including your name, job title, company, email address, telephone number and location.
When you download or access our white papers or marketing materials, we may collect your name, contact information, location and other information.
We may also collect your name, contact and other information when you participate in promotions and contests; access product demonstrations; participate in seminars, training courses or product-related events; apply for a job; complete a survey; register products; or seek technical support, or customer or consulting services.
Device and Network Information.  When you download a software or a software license key or apply for an unlock code, we will collect information about you and your device, including location information.  This information includes personal information about you and your location and the serial number of the device.  In addition, if you use any of our network planning and management services, such as LinkPlanner™ or cnMaestro™ or Wireless Manager™, and establish an account with us, we will collect information about your network and the devices attached to it, including the following:  (i) MAC address, (ii) device type, (iii) operating system, (iv) geo-location information, and (v) network traffic information (e.g. hostnames, protocols, port numbers and IP addresses).  When you use location-enabled Services, we may collect, process, use and share information about your actual real-time geographic location, such as signals sent by a mobile device.  We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may provide information on and to nearby Wi-Fi access points.
Use of our Network Life Cycle Management Services.  If you use our cnMaestro™ Services to manage your network, we will collect information about your use of such Services.  We may also collect additional information from or about you and your network customers, including, without limitation, information about the nature of the devices connected to the network.  However, we will only use such information when necessary or appropriate to provide our services to our customers (or when legally authorized or required to ensure compliance with the law or this Privacy Policy or to respond to lawful requests).  For Cambium Networks devices that use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, we may transmit certain geo-location information about those devices (and the network(s) on which they are running) to Google and other third party geo-location services, which in turn provides us with related geo-location information that we store.

Any non-personal information that we collect from your use of our Sites or Services, whether through cookies or otherwise, may be used in combination with other information for analytical purposes, to track the number of visitors to our Site or to each page of our Site, the domain names of the internet service provider of visitors to our Sites, and how users interact with and use the Site.  We will take all steps that are reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy as well as applicable data protection laws, including, where relevant, by entering into EU standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures).
Community Forum and Chatrooms
If you participate in a discussion forum or chatroom on one of our Sites, we will collect registration information from you when you register on our Community Forum; in addition, any information that you post may be available to other users or the general public.  As a result, other third parties will potentially be able to read, collect or use your information, including to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the information that you publish on our discussion forums, including our Community Forum, or chatrooms.  Also, if you post any content to our Sites – such as a comment to a blog – we collect information about what you have posted, as well as your name and contact information if you submit it.
Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites and Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf). Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies). For additional information about cookies directed to EU users, please see our Cookie Policy.
Cookies.  A cookie is a small piece of computer code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, which enables our web servers to identify users and collect certain usage Sites information from users. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites and Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can delete cookie files from your hard drive, or avoid cookies by configuring your browser to reject them or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your hard drive.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to manage how your computer accepts cookies. Visitors to our Sites who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies .   Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of Sites visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Sites usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.  We may also collect usage information via java script, log files and other sources.
Third-party Analytics .  We use third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Sites and Services to our visitors’ needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.
Widgets.  Our Sites may include widgets.  Widgets are mini-programs that provide specific services from another company (e.g. news, opinions, music, etc.) on our Sites. Widgets may collect information and cookies may also be set by the widget. Information collected by widgets is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
Third Party Ad Network
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. If you are in the EU, you may opt-out of certain third party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeting through http://www.youronlinechoices.eu or www.aboutads.info.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org.
User Generated Content
We may invite you to post content on our Sites or Services, including your comments, reviews, pictures, and any other information. If you post such content, all of the information that you post will be available to other users of our Sites and Services.  Your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.
Access to Your Personal Information
If you would like to update your registration information you may do so by contacting your Cambium Networks representative or emailing us at privacy@cambiumnetworks.com.  In addition, you may have the ability to view or edit your personal information in other areas of the Sites or through registration-required portals for customers, distributors or resellers. We will make good faith efforts to honor reasonable requests to correct inaccurate personal information we are not required by law to retain, and to delete your personal information and account, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
If you are a resident of the European Union, please see the Information for EU Individuals section below for additional information on accessing your information and other legal rights available to you under European Union law.

Securing Personal Information
We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Other Websites Linked to the Sites
From time to time we may include links to other parties’ websites and services that you are free to visit.  We do not control these third-party Sites or services and you visit them at your own risk.  The use of these Sites and the treatment of any personal information you provide to these Sites are not covered by this Policy. If you follow any links you should review the privacy statements of those websites.
California Privacy Rights
California residents may request a list of certain third parties to which we have disclosed personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response.
