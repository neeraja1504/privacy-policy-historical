We use Cookies on different sites in order to make our website more attractive to visitors and to enable the use of certain functions. The matter in this case concerns small text data files, which will be filed on your computer.

Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") from the social network  facebook.com  which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").

The Plugins can be viewed here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/
If you call up one of our internet website pages which has a plugin of this kind, your browser sets up a direct link to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and integrated by it into the website.
Through the integration of plugins, Facebook obtains the information that you have called up the relevant page on our website. If you are logged on your Facebook-Account, Facebook can assign your visit to your Facebook-Account. If you interact with the plugins, for example, if you activate the "Like" button or enter a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook and saved there.
