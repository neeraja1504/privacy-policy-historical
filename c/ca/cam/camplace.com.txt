However, you may choose to share with a Model/Channel other information about you for example: connect your camera in private chat in order to visually communicate with the Model or just turn on your microphone. The Model/Channel is not allowed to record the visuals you provide.
What else do we show about you to the Models?
As the Models/Channels are appearing on several sites at the same time (all our sites and affiliated sites), we show them from which site you are visiting from
We show them a special icon, if you are a regular Member on a site and already purchased a certain number of tokens, so that they know that you deserve extra attention and a good service.
With other users of the site and with the public
When you initiate a private chat with a Model, only our organization and the Model/Channel can access the communications and/or images (in case you turn on your webcam) you share. Be assured that other Guests or Members of Camplace will not access any information about you from the moment you enter into a private chat.
We use carefully selected and trusted third parties, who act as service providers to our site.
We ensure that they are bound by contractually binding obligations to process information we share with them in accordance with our instructions, this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws.
As we constantly work on the development and enhancement of the technology to support our site, our third party service providers use may regularly change. Such entities mainly belong to the following areas: (a) business intelligence and analytics; (b) customer care; (c) marketing and sales.
Payment providers and financial institutions
When you purchase tokens your payment may be processed by a third party bank or payment processor and you may share with this party certain details, as well as payment information for the purpose of completing a transaction.
You may receive transactional emails from this party confirming the order, including dispatch, possible refunds, and follow-up invitations to leave feedback for this party.
If you share information with third parties directly, this Privacy Policy does not govern the processing of your personal information by these third parties.

Upon verification of your identity, your request will be sent to our Support Team.

In certain cases, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
Rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data

We process your data for a variety of reason. Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes.
In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.
Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop sending you marketing emails.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved.
Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:
· If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.
· You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.
· You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.
· We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
· Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR). You may contact our data privacy officer via dpo@camplace.com.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our services and the way we handle your personal information or changes in the applicable laws.
If we make changes we consider important, we will let you know by placing a notice on the relevant site and/or contact you using other methods such as email.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, such changes will be applicable from the time they are published on our site, unless we specify a date of entry into force. Your continued use of our site from that day on will be subject to the new Privacy Policy.
