About CampInTouch and the Information We Collect  Profile Information submitted by Members to CampInTouch
CampInTouch is an online social networking community that connects people through networks of camps by communicating, sharing, making new friends, and finding old friends. To accomplish this, each CampInTouch Member creates his or her own profile within their camp network, which contains the personal information that the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:
A. First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member),
B. Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information,
C. Occupation,
D. Schools attended or companies with whom the Member is associated,
F. Location (e.g., city and state), and
G. Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.
Other Information submitted by Members to CampInTouch
CampInTouch also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address, to identify Members and send notifications related to the use of the CampInTouch service. You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the CampInTouch website, such as while sharing memories, stories, questions of the week, etc.  This information, in turn, may be viewed by other members of your specific camp network.  No visitors or members of other camp networks can access your information.
Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to CampInTouch
Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the CampInTouch website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.

Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:
A. When the Member invites a friend via email to become a CampInTouch Member,
B. When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the CampInTouch service or CampInTouch website, and
C. When we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the CampInTouch service or the CampInTouch website.
Except when inviting friends, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their bunkmates, and other Members within their camp networks communicate on CampInTouch with each other through the CampInTouch service, without disclosing email addresses.

However, CampInTouch may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the CampInTouch website more targeted advertising, products and services.

Changes in Our Privacy Policy

Invite a Friend
If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the CampInTouch service, we ask them for the friend's email address. CampInTouch will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. CampInTouch stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the Member sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. CampInTouch will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may contact  CampInTouch to request the removal of this information from our database.
