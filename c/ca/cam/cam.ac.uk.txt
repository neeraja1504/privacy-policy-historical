The information published here applies to the use of your personal information (also known as ‘personal data’) by the University of Cambridge through the viewing or use of its core website (www.cam.ac.uk) or any website within the University of Cambridge domain which has pointed you to this page. Each of the 31 Colleges of the University is a separate legal entity for these purposes and each College website will supply you with its own information. The information published here is limited to the use of personal information by University websites; various other notices are published in relation to our use of the personal information of applicants, students, staff, alumni, research participants, and others.
When you visit www.cam.ac.uk we use a third-party service, Qualtrics to gather answers to survey questions if you participate. We collect your IP address as part of this process.

The use of your personal information in the above ways is necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its websites, analysing their use and ensuring their security.
