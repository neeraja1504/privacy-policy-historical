Compliance and Security
Security
Campus Labs treats the security of our Clients’ data and Constituent data with utmost importance. We take many precautions at the infrastructure and software layers to deliver the highest level of protection for your Personal Information and other additional Constituent data provided by you or our Clients. Campus Labs owns and operates the database and web servers that host Clients' websites and, stores Client and Constituent data, including your Personal Information. These servers are protected by securely configured firewalls that prevent data from being accessed via the Internet. Each of our Client's data, Personal Information, and other additional Constituent data are stored in a dedicated database; this prevents the intrusion or corruption of data. In addition, our Clients' data catalogs cannot see or access each other's data.
SSL
Measures have been taken to make transactions secure for Members on our Sites and transaction pages. Login, and administrative activity are transmitted over an industry standard Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”). All transactions encrypt your Personal Information to prevent unauthorized access as the information travels over the Internet.
Logins and Passwords
Strong passwords are required for each login, and they are stored in a format that cannot be read by administrators or employees. Multiple failed logins or lost login requests are challenged by reCaptcha. An administrative rights system restricts authenticated but unauthorized access to Constituent data.
Federated Authentication
Campus Labs connects to Clients’ authentication systems in order to identify and credential users. This means that the client logs in using their campus username and password. The centerpiece of each method is a secure transmission of a unique identifier for a user upon a successful granting of credentials. Some of the supported protocols also allow for the passing of additional attributes from a directory or other campus system.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Campus Labs does not encourage the collection, storage, or display of sensitive personal information or personally identifiable information in our System or use of our Services. We define “Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII” as information which includes: (i) Non-Public Directory information as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA); (ii) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); or (iii) government issued identifications, including, but not limited to, Social Security Numbers, Driver License Numbers, and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers.

Our security standards and data protection cover the data entered and maintained within the system. Client’s authorized administrators are also required to follow proper guidelines and standards in the use of the data and our Services to prevent unintended access of all data we maintain within our System.
