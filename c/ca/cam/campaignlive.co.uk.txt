Collection of your personal data
Personal data you provide directly to us
We collect personal data from you when you enquire about or request a product or service directly from us. For example you will provide personal data to us when you;
register on one of our websites
join online forums
subscribe to a magazine
apply for a job
sign up for a digital product or service
register to attend a conference, an award or forum event
request a newsletter/bulletin

The information we routinely collect will include your contact details (e.g. name, email address, phone number and postal address). We will also collect specific information where relevant for a particular service. For example, you would provide your car registration number if requesting a vehicle valuation or you may choose to upload your CV when using one of our job sites.
When you register to attend one of our events, we may also collect details about your dietary and accessibility requirements. We only collect this information with your explicit consent and will only use it for the purposes of your attendance at the event.
To learn more please see How we use your personal data.
When you visit our websites
When you visit one of our websites for the first time, you will receive a “pop-up” notice informing you that we use Cookies. Some personal data (for example a unique identifier, your IP address and geographical location) will be collected through our and our technology partners’ use of cookies and similar technologies. To learn more please see our Cookie Notice.
From other organisations or publicly available sources
We sometimes combine information we have collected from our websites or other sources, with information received from other organisations. This is used to:
verify the personal data we hold for you (e.g. to check your postal address is correct)
enhance the content and relevance of the advertising we provide to you. To learn more please see Personalisation of marketing & website content and our Cookie Notice.
We may also research publicly available sources (e.g. websites and LinkedIn) and use external suppliers, to identify business contacts who are likely to be interested in the products and services we have to offer. We will only collect the minimal amount of information required for this purpose (e.g. name, job title, company and contact details) and when we contact you we will always provide you with an easy way to object to us continuing to retain your personal data.
The lawful bases we rely on
Under the GDPR there are six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data. We have identified four which we rely upon for our business activities: Consent, Contractual, Legitimate Interests and Legal Obligation.
Contractual – in many circumstances we rely on the lawful basis of “performance of a contract”, this enables us to respond to you when you express an interest in our products and services and to fulfil any requests. To learn more please see Fulfilment of a service.
Consent – in some circumstances we rely on your specific consent, whereby you actively agree and “opt-in”. We will always make it clear how you can withdraw you consent at any time. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.
Legal Obligation – there will be circumstances under which we are legally obliged to hold your personal data or required to disclose it to a third party by law.
Legitimate Interests – for some of our activities we rely on our legitimate business interests to collect and use your personal data. In such cases, we have balanced our interests with yours and do not believe these activities will have a negative impact on your privacy rights and freedoms. We specifically rely on Legitimate Interests to:
manage specific aspects of our events. To learn more please see Conference events, Award events and Forum events
send you marketing communications about our products and services. To learn more please see Marketing communications
send you marketing communications related to other companies’ products and services (in a business-to-business context). To learn more please see Marketing communications
personalise the marketing content we provide you. To learn more please see Personalisation of marketing & website content
share your contact details with a named sponsor, when you access specific sponsored content. To learn more please see Sponsored content
undertake business sales and advertising activities
share your CV with recruitment agencies (at your request) when you sign up for our job seeking services
research publicly available business contact details. To learn more please see Collection of your personal data and From other organisations or publicly available sources
customise the content you see on our websites. To learn more please see Personalisation of marketing & website content
You can always object to our marketing messages, please see How to stop receiving marketing communications.
If you wish to object to our reliance on Legitimate Interests for any other purpose please use Our contact details.
How we use your personal data
Magazine subscriptions
If you subscribe to receive one of our magazines, we will use the details you provide us to send you the magazine, to process your payment details, to provide you access to any digital content that’s part of your subscription, to respond to any queries you may have and to contact you with information relating to your subscription (e.g. to confirm your subscription has started, to confirm if your subscription is due to expire, to send you password reminder emails, or to notify you of any changes to the service).
Online accounts
Creating an online account with one of our websites gives you access to further functionality, features and content. Online accounts can be created directly by you when you register or subscribe. The personal details we collect to create online accounts will include your name, email address, username and password. We also collect the IP address you are using to access our website so we can provide IP-based subscriptions and to detect and prevent any account misuse.
Corporate subscriptions can rely on providing access to our website based on the domain name of the email address used to create a user account, or based on monitoring the IP address being used to access our website. This information would have been shared with us by the organisation who requested the corporate subscription.
During your registration, you may provide us with further details about you, such as your job title and the industry sector you work in. We use these details combined and other information we know about you to help tailor the service to be more relevant, to help with our own analysis of how the service is used, and to provide summarised context to our research. This information will include the different pieces of content you have viewed on our websites.
Live events
Some of our brands will organise live events aimed at delivering the latest information, insight and opinions from a wide range of industry sectors.
We will use the personal details you provide us when you register to attend an event so we know who’s attending and to allow access. If you are making a group booking or booking on someone’s behalf, please ensure you have their permission to share their name and contact details with us.
Photographs and video footage may be taken at our events and used in post-event publicity or future promotional material. If you don’t want to be captured in any photos or video footage, please let the photographer know on the day of the event. You can also email us if you believe you have been included in a photograph or video footage and object to it being used for post-event publicity or future promotional material.
For some of our events, you may be asked for your badge to be scanned by our seminar hosts, sponsors and exhibitors. This allows us to confirm who attended a seminar and provides a way for our sponsors and exhibitors to send you further information about the event, using the details you provided us when you registered. Privacy notices will be displayed on the day of the event to inform you of this activity. If you do not wish for your details to be shared in this way, then please feel free to object to your badge from being scanned.
We will sometimes provide a formal meal with a set menu and table service at some of our events. You are given the opportunity to inform us of any dietary requirements during the registration process. We only use this information for the purpose of your attendance at the event. To ensure we’re able to meet these requirements, we have to share this information with venues so you receive your dietary choice.
For some of our events, the content is spread out over a few days and some delegates are provided with accommodation at venues hosting the event. To ensure a seamless professional service, we share personal details with venues to ensure rooms are booked under their name, and to enable easy check-in.
You may voluntarily inform us of specific accessibility requirements that help us ensure the service we provide you is specific to your needs. We only use this information for the purpose of your attendance at the event, and share it with venues hosting the event to help meet these requirements (e.g. table plans, specific accommodation).
We will also share the delegate list with the venue for fire regulation and safety purposes.
Please find below further information about how your personal details will be used when you register to attend one of our conferences, awards or forum events.
Conference events
These events are a chance for delegates and other visitors to meet, learn and discuss the latest topics and trends with other attendees and industry service suppliers.
We will share your details (name, job title and company name ONLY) with event sponsors and speakers, to help them prepare for networking opportunities and to ensure that any content and activity on the day is tailored specifically to the audience attending. This information is not used for sales and marketing communications. Please email us if you would prefer us not to share your details in this way.
Award events
These events are a chance to celebrate the achievements of both our clients and customers, which will involve the disclosure of some limited personal details into the public. When entering an award, we will send you a few service emails to communicate important information relating to the awards. This may include a confirmation once you completed your entry, or a reminder if we notice you haven’t completed your entry and the last entry date is approaching.
Your details (name, job title and company name ONLY) will be shared with other attendees within an award brochure, event guide, table plan and screen presentation. Please email us if you would prefer your name not to appear.
Forum events
These events are specifically designed to invite delegates to tailored supplier meetings and to network with like-minded people. We believe it is in everyone’s interests for business contact details to be shared between delegates and suppliers. We will inform you about who the service suppliers are during the registration stage and when organising tailored supplier meetings.
If you have any queries or concerns please email us.
Sponsored content
Our Haymarket Business Media brands often provide sponsored content, such as webinars, expert reports, whitepapers, surveys or events. Before being able to access any content, we ask that you create an free online account first. We collect basic work contact details and other information about your company and job role.
When accessing specific content that has been sponsored by another organisation, we will also ask you to complete a short form requesting your permission to share your details with the sponsor. We will share basic work contact details and some of the other information you provided when you created your account, or collected subsequently when accessing the specific content. We will always provide a link to the sponsor’s full privacy notice so you are fully aware of how they will process your personal data.
Sharing your details with the content sponsor is always your choice and you will always be provided with a clear opportunity to indicate if you would prefer us not to share this information.
Job seeking service
Some of our Haymarket Business Media brands provide job seeking services that allow you to apply for jobs, receive job alerts and other job related emails, upload your CV, and share your details with recruiters via our searchable CV database. Your CV will only be included in our CV database with your permission. We ask for your permission when you upload your CV while applying for a specific job or creating an online account. You can subsequently choose to be removed from our CV database at anytime by changing your permission settings in your account area, or by emailing us directly.
If you apply for a job, your details will be shared with the recruiter promoting the specific role. At your request we will share your CV with Top CV so they contact you about receiving a free CV review.
Marketing communications
When we collect your personal data we will include a specific notice to inform you and give you choices about future direct marketing communications from us.
We will only send you direct marketing communications when you have either:
provided your consent (e.g. ticked a box or clicked a “button” to submit a form)
where we believe we can demonstrate a legitimate business interest and have balanced this with your interests and privacy.
It is always your choice and you can stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time. We will provide a clear and easy way to do this on any communication you receive. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.
For electronic marketing communications (via email, sms and phone) we adhere to the rules of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).
When you provide us with your personal details for a particular service, we may also share some of these details with a 3rd party for their sales and marketing activities. We will only do this if you have given us your permission to share your details for this purpose. For example, we may ask for your permission to share your details with a 3rd party when you enter a prize draw, when you download sponsored content, or when you register to attend an event.
Personalised marketing & website content
We want to ensure our marketing communications are of interest to you. We therefore use the information we know about you to tailor our messages to be more relevant. We will use details such as your job title, industry sector, geographical location, previous transactional history, website usage, and your interactions with our marketing content to try and do this. Please also see our Cookie Notice. You have the right to object, but this will mean we will be unable to send your marketing communications in future, as we do not wish to send irrelevant messages to you. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.
We believe website content is more interesting to you when it is relevant. We provide tailored recommendations and advertisements to customise the content that you see on our websites. To do this, we use cookies and similar technologies through various technology partners to help us understand how you interact with our websites (e.g. the content you viewed on a previous visit or aggregated website performance analytics). To learn more please see our Cookie Notice.
Research
When you use our website, you may be asked for your feedback and opinions. Your answers will help us improve our products and services, develop new ones, and provide information for our editorial articles. If you’re a subscriber then we may use some of the information you have provided before to help summarise the answers and give our analysis further context. For example, a question that simply asks if you listen to industry podcasts, can be combined with the job title you previously provided us to report that 80% of Marketing Managers listen to industry podcasts.
Prize draws and prize competitions
We will use the personal details you provide us to administer any prize draw or prize competition you decide to enter. The personal details we collect may include your name, email address, phone number, and postal address. These details will be used to notify you if you’ve been shortlisted or if you’re the winner. We will only share the details you provide us with a third party if they need this information to deliver or to fulfil the prize.
If you’re the winner of a prize draw or prize competition, your details may be used for publicity or promotional purposes. If you don’t want your details used in this way, please notify us when we inform you that you’ve won. For more information, please visit our competition terms and conditions.
How to stop receiving marketing communications
We don’t want to send you marketing communications if you do not want to receive them. You can stop receiving these messages from us at anytime.
We have a diverse range of brands in our Haymarket Automotive, and Haymarket Business Media divisions, which you may not realise are all published by Haymarket Media Group. You may therefore wish to be selective and just stop receiving marketing communications from one brand rather than from them all.
Emails : There will always be an unsubscribe link on any marketing email you receive from us. Some of our brands (where relevant) provide a level of granularity to the types of emails you can unsubscribe from.
Post : We will inform you in any postal communication how you can stop receiving direct mail in future.
Phone : If you receive a marketing call from us, please let the call operator know if you don’t want to receive calls again.
SMS : Please text “STOP” to any message received.

Protecting children
All of our brands are aimed at adults and are not designed for use by children. However, we accept that on occasion children may visit our websites. Where we believe any of our brands may attract children under the age of 16, we will clearly provide information notices to try and deter children from providing their personal data.
We clearly stipulate that entry into any of our competitions is only available to over 18s. In exceptional circumstances we may lower this, but never lower than 16 and this will always be clearly stipulated in the terms and conditions for the specific competition.
We do not knowingly intend to send marketing communications to children.
We actively encourage all our staff, whenever they are implementing new promotions, offers or events to assess whether these might be attractive to children and if so, will ensure clear information is provided to try and deter children from providing their personal data.
If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that we may be processing personal data related to your child, please use Our contact details.
Your rights
Under data protection law you have a number of rights. These are aimed at giving you control about how your personal data is used by us.

If you are unhappy with the manner in which we have collected and are using your personal data please do not hesitate to contact us.
If you are concerned with the manner in which we have handled your personal data, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority. In the UK this is the Information Commissioner’s Office.
Access your personal data
You can request a copy of the personal data we may hold relating to you, and the purposes for which we are using it. This is known as a Subject Access Request.

Keeping your data secure
Where we store and process your personal data
Ensuring your personal data is kept and transferred securely is of the highest importance to us.
We hold your personal data on our secure systems, mainly based within the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Please also see How we keep your personal data secure. Where we employ service providers, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure your personal data is protected.
Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may be required for the purposes of our staff based outside the EEA or where a supplier of a service is based outside the EEA. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure your personal data is treated securely. This includes Model Contractual Arrangements as approved by the European Commission, and the EU-US Privacy Shield.
How we keep your personal data secure
We are committed to protecting the security of the personal data we hold. We deploy appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure your personal data is kept securely and to prevent any unauthorised access. We have robust procedures and features in place to prevent such unauthorised access.
We also require any parties to whom we transfer personal data to ensure they have appropriate security measures in place. Please also see Fulfilment of a service.
How long do we keep your personal data
We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your information for will vary depending on the products and services we are providing to you. We will only keep your personal data for a reasonable period of time and we base this on the purpose for which we are using it.
There will be circumstances in which we keep a strictly minimal amount of information about you, for example to ensure we can honour an objection to receiving direct marketing. We will also, in specific circumstances, be required to retain personal data for a longer period of time for contractual or legal reasons.
We have a detailed internal schedule for ensuring we do not hold your personal data for longer than we justifiably need it. To learn more please use Our contact details.
Reporting security vulnerabilities
We are committed to the privacy, safety and security of our customers. If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we would ask you to please report it just to us in a responsible manner. Please email us at data.protection@haymarket.com and we will respond to you as soon as possible. This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue. Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability could put the wider community at risk, and therefore we encourage you to come to us first. We’ll keep you informed as we move forward with our investigations.
Cookie Notice
The aim of our Cookie Notice is to provide you with a summary of the tracking technologies we use and how you can control what is set and when. We keep our Cookie Notice under regular review to best reflect the technology we use on our sites.
Cookies and tracking technologies we use
Where Haymarket Media Group Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites (please see Our brands) we refer to the following:
Flash Cookies
A local shared object, sometimes called a “Flash cookie,” is a data file that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit. They are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience. Adobe’s website provides details regarding Flash Cookies
Web Beacons
To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our subscribers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Pixels
A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer in order to trigger a cookie. We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you e.g. to understand how you interact with our email marketing.
Log Files
We use log files to record events that occur on our websites. This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content or time of transaction made via your device. These audit trails allow us to analyse activities on our websites.
How and why we use cookies and tracking technologies
Types of Cookies and how they are set
There are two types of cookies:
“Session Cookies” – Stored temporarily in your computer’s memory while you are visiting a website and are deleted when you close your browser.
“Persistent Cookies” – Stored for a set period on your computer and used to determine whether there has been any contact between us and your computer in the past.
There are two ways cookies set can be on our websites:
“1st Party Cookies” – cookies that are set by the website domain (or belonging to a sub domain) of the website.
“3rd Party Cookies” – cookies that are set by another website domain. (e.g. by one of our main technology partners or by an external web services)
Cookies Classification
We are categorising cookies set on the site by ourselves and our main technology partners into the following categories:
Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies
These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you’ve asked for (such as access to secure areas) can’t be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you that can be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet.
Category 2: Performance cookies
These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works. These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can’t learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.
Category 3: Functionality cookies
These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you’re in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember log-in details, changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you’ve asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies may be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you’ve previously made or personalise your browsing experience.
Category 4: Targeting and advertising cookies
We use these to provide adverts on our sites that we believe are more relevant to you. Without these cookies, online adverts you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. We also enable some advertising partners to set cookies specifically to enable them to analyse advertising campaign performance.
