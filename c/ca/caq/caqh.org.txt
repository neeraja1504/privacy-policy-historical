(a)  Cookies.  Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your computer. CAQH may attempt to install cookies when a user arrives at any of our Sites or uses our Services. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the Sites and Services. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to any of our Sites, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our Sites or Services.
(b) User Analytics.   We may collect general statistics to track user trends on our Sites and Services. These statistics may include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Sites, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any Personal Information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. We may use this statistical information for research and commercial purposes and to develop improvements to our Sites and Services.
(c)  Information Users Provide to CAQH.  We collect and store User Submitted Data when you register to use our Sites or Services, utilize the Services on our Sites, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email.

If you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Sites and we may not be able to provide you with our Services. For administrative and security purposes, such as to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the CAQH site, we may collect and retain information, such as IP addresses.
We may use your User Submitted Data internally, among other things, to communicate with you, to provide information or Services to you, to contact you directly about Services that you have purchased, and for our research or business purposes.

3.  WHAT SECURITY PROCEDURES DOES CAQH USE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
CAQH uses physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using User Submitted Data.
