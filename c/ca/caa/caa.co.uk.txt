Publication Subscription Service – this service allows users to set-up an account on the CAA website so that an email can be sent to them when a new or amended publication has been added to one or more subscription categories that are of interest. Users are able to manage their account at any time and the users’ password is not known to the CAA.  The user's details are not shared with any third party and will never be used for any other purpose.
CAA Forums – The CAA has a number of closed forums which are hosted on the CAA website.  Participation to use a forum is controlled by invitation by the CAA forum owner who will create a user account and send an invite to the users to participate in the forum.  Once established the forum member is able to manage their own account and password. The user's details are not shared with any third party and will never be used for any other purpose.
