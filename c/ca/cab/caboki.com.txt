How we gather information from users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you request free sample or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites, Caboki.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.
The Types of Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It
During registration you are required to give us your name, email address and a password. We use this information to create your account, send you monthly newsletters which you may opt-out of at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each communication or by logging into your account and deselecting the box, and contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest.
If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personal information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your account information and a newsletter sign up verification email. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used to enhance user experience. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
Who We May Share Your Information With

Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
