This data is treated as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. We only use this data in aggregate form to perform statistical analyses on user behavior and characteristics. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and the Service.
How My Information Is Shared:
Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties with your permission or as permitted in our TOS. The third parties may in turn publicly display or publish the Public Content in connection with their own website and media platforms.
We provide some of our services through affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties. We, and our service partners, may use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. These affiliates and third party service providers are not permitted to use personal information for any purposes other than to complete the order, assist you in participating in the particular service and communicating with you. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.
We may disclose information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationships with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.
In the future, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service. These companies may use information about your Public Content (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and activity related to your use of the Service to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
One of the primary reasons people use Carbon38 is to connect with other users and service providers. Information such as your name and photo, location, list of friends, and the comments you write is shared with the Carbon38 community. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service.
