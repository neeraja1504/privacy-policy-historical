Privacy Policy – Best Dress Up Games Online | Play Makeover, Make Up & Avatar Games for Free, Social Network For Girls - Cartoon Doll Emporium (CDE)
Cartoondollemporium.com (CDE) is a safe, carefully-moderated games website and social network. The entire CDE site is in full compliance with COPPA regulations, as outlined below. CDE is owned and operated by people who care about your children as if they were their own. CDE was born as a labor of love and continues to be one every day. We encourage parents to bring their questions, comments, and concerns to us.
CDE is located at:
Cartoon Doll Emporium 115 West 27th Street, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10001 and we can be reached at cdehelp@gmail.com.
Cartoon Doll Emporium and its sister sites are owned and operated by Driver Digital Inc.
The main areas of CDE are free to use, require no registration, collect no information, and do not store any personally identifiable information. These include our "Dolls and Games," "CDE TV," and "Blog" sections. The only section of our site that requires registration is our social network, MyCDE. Some games require registration with our social network in order to play, and are covered under the "MyCDE Social Network paragraph" below.
MyCDE Social Network
Registering for MyCDE involves inputting an e-mail address, birthday, and a handle, or username. We require an email address in order to protect our users. By verifying that a valid e-mail address is used, we can be certain the registrant is a person and not a robot who could cause harm to our social network or its participants. CDE does not view or use registrants' information for any purpose except to identify potential threats to the safety of our environment and serve relevant information. CDE does e-mail users on occasion, but never more than once per week, and only if they have opted to receive updates about our social network. Updates and announcements about MyCDE are the only kinds of e-mails users will ever receive from us. CDE occasionally uses cookies to track how our users landed on our site, but not to collect any personal information.
CDE never asks its users for personally identifiable information such as full name, telephone number, or home address. In addition, MyCDE is monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by live people, and electronic scripts are constantly running in order to prevent the transmission of personally identifiable information and generally protect the identities of MyCDE users.
CDE never discloses any of the information it collects to third parties for any reason whatsoever.
Users under the age of 13 must provide a parent or guardian’s email address so that s/he can give permission for their child to use MyCDE. A parents’ e-mail address will be used to deliver relevant safety updates and announcement about the site. They may also be used to log in to the MyCDE parents section in order to monitor their child’s online behavior.
At any time, a parent may request that their child’s account and information be deleted by contacting us at cdehelp@gmail.com. A representative from MyCDE may ask for clarification about the reasons for deletion for our own internal records, but will never refuse to delete an account except if there are grave safety concerns involved (for instance, if a user has been bullying another user, we may choose to retain the account of either party for a short amount of time in order to properly address the situation).
