We may have similar products and services we may be able to offer you.

In some areas of our website, we ask you to provide information as we may wish to reply to you after your visit. This would include where you subscribe to our newsletters or register to for alerts for an item we do not yet have in stock, or provide feedback to CarReg through an online contact form or when you complete any on line survey we may offer from time to time. When you do so, we ask you to give CarReg your name, email address and other personal information that will be needed to supply the services to you. In relation to any mailings you can ‘unsubscribe’ at any time. We may use your personal data for future email mailings, support, notification of new products available and releases, general correspondence regarding the products which may relate to your enquiry or order.

3. Trading/Website Security
Making sure you can buy safely and securely online is a priority for CarReg and we have made efforts to ensure that our security is one of our highest. We have devoted a great deal of effort to ensure that our online security measures help to safeguard your information. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Skypay are the payment gateway providers. We use industry-standard Thawte Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of:
Potentially sensitive information such as your name and address and telephone details
Critically-sensitive information like your payment card number
We hope that once you understand the measures we take to help ensure secure transactions and privacy, and the steps you can take yourself, you will be as happy about the safety of your online transaction and order information as we are. We have no desire to infringe your privacy while using our site and we will never provide your personal information to anyone else except if in future we sell our business in whole or in part.
