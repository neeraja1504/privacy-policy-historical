Privacy
The State of Victoria endorses fair information handling practices and uses of information in accordance with the privacy legislation.
Personal information will be used only for the purposes intended and where the intention includes confidentiality, information will be treated as such unless otherwise required by law.
This privacy statement explains how your personal information (being information capable of identifying you as an individual) will be treated as you access and interact with this website.
The practices outlined in this privacy statement are subject to any rights the State of Victoria may have to handle personal information in compliance with its obligations under the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic).
Security
We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal information that we have under our control. However, you should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the Internet. So while we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us online and individuals do so at their own risk.
Once any personal information comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. If you are concerned about conveying sensitive material to us over the Internet, you might prefer to contact us by telephone or mail.
We will remove personal information from our system where it is no longer required (except where archiving is required and in order to fulfill our obligations under the Public Records Act 1973 (Vic)).
We take additional steps to protect the security of your personal information, such as strong 128-bit SSL encryption. Before using these facilities, you should ensure that you are using a web browser that supports 128-bit encryption. In many web browsers, you can confirm that your session is encrypted by the appearance of a locked padlock symbol located in the browser status bar at the foot of the browser.
Feedback, information request form and email
We may preserve the content of any feedback form, information request form, email or other electronic message that we receive. Any personal information contained in that message will only be used or disclosed in ways set out in this Website Privacy Statement. We will not use that information to add you to a mailing list without your consent.
