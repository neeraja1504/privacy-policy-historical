This Privacy Notice explains the information collected and stored at CARTO and associated applications, web services, and other mechanisms associated with CARTO (collectively, the “Service”).

How you accept this Notice
By visiting the CARTO website (the “Site”) or using the Service, including by registering, or by otherwise providing us with personal information (“PI”) (such as an email address), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Notice.
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of text that websites you visit can place on the device you’re using to make the visit—generally a computer or mobile device. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you—they merely recognize your Web browser.
First-party cookies are cookies set by us on our Site or the Services. Third-party cookies are set by the external providers whose services are used by our Site; these external providers also set their own cookies. Third-party cookies’ terms of use are governed by the external provider’s specific terms and conditions, which we have no control over.
We use cookies to make interactions with the Site and Services easy and meaningful. When you use the Site and choose to accept analytics cookies, we use these to optimize the Site by collecting and reporting information on how you use it. When you use the Services and agree to our Terms, we employ analytics cookies for the same reason.
We use Google, HotJar, and Hubspot on the Site for analytics, and additionally use TrackJS on the Services for the same. HotJar and Hubspot both set Third-Party cookies when you use the Site and choose to accept analytics cookies, or when you use the Services and agree to our Terms; the remaining providers set only First-Party Cookies.
We use the following external providers’ services on the Site: Twitter, Vimeo, and YouTube. These external providers may change their terms of service, as well as purpose and use of cookies at any time. No third-party cookies will be installed on your device by these providers if you do not view the content they service.
We may update the external providers we use periodically.
Information we collect that is not PI
We collect information that is not PI in connection with use of the Site or the Service, such as login and device-related information (e.g., browser type, your IP address, and the date and time of day of your use). Such information may be considered PI in your jurisdiction.
How we use information that is not PI
We may use collected information to enhance the visitor experience of the Site or the Service, to operate and maintain the Service, to investigate and understand how our Service is used, to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Service, and to analyze our business.
We analyze traffic to the site in various ways, including using a service called Google Analytics. We use this information to generate statistics and to measure activity to improve the usefulness of the Site and the Service.
Google Analytics is subject to the privacy policy of Google. By visiting the Site or using the Service, you are agreeing to the terms of the Google Privacy Policy that apply to Google Analytics. These terms can be found at “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, located at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time.
We are not responsible for any changes made to the Google Privacy Policy or of advising you of such changes. We reserve the right to change analytical service providers at any time without notice.
What we collect that is PI
We collect the following PI from those who choose to purchase our paid plan: name, address, email address, phone number, credit card information and organization information.
For customers who use the free version of CARTO we collect the following information: name, email, password and some social media information (e.g. Twitter handle) that you may choose provide to us.
We may also collect other PI if you contact us or otherwise give it to us (e.g., in an email).
How we use and disclose PI
We use personal data to provide you with the Service per the Terms and Conditions, to enhance the visitor experience of the Service, to operate and maintain the Service, to investigate and understand how the Service is used, to communicate with you about using the Service, to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Service, and to analyze our business.
If you consent to marketing communications the Company may also use information you provide to send you information regarding CARTO.
We may disclose PI as required by law or in response to service of legal process, such as a court order, summons, subpoena, or the like.
We may share PI with our corporate affiliates and with business partners who provide services related to the Service (such as website hosting or technical support). These business partners do not have the right to use this PI for any purpose other than those related to the Service.
Information about our users, including PI, may be disclosed or transferred to entities now or in the future affiliated with CARTO or as part of any merger, acquisition, change of control, debt financing, insolvency, bankruptcy or sale of our assets. Such information may be used in the businesses of any entity so receiving it.
Except as provided above, we will not sell or transfer your PI to third parties.
Do not track
Currently, various browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Site, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. However, we will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
How you can access or change the PI that you have provided
Once you have registered with us, you can access your profile, review the information that is stored, and revise that information.
Customer data
Customer data is all the information including text, images, location data, other PI, or any other files that you provide, or are provided on their behalf, to us through your use of the Service. We inform you that you are responsible for the provision of any PI.
We will not collect customer data. CARTO only processes it for the provision of the Service, and it will not be processed for any other purposes.
Children
We do not target, market to, or knowingly collect PI from children under the age of thirteen.
Data retention
We retain your PI for up to 2 years, after which it is destroyed.
Data security
We use industry standard physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your PI. We cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit to the Service, and you do so at your own risk. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing or by emailing us at legal@carto.com.
