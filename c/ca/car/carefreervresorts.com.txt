Sun Communities encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Sun Communities so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information.

Sun Communities may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Sun Communities may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

Sun Communities Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Sun Communities or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Sun Communities; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Sun Communities, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The Sun Communities Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Sun Communities pages, or register with Sun Communities site or services, a cookie helps Sun Communities to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Sun Communities Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Sun Communities features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sun Communities services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Sun Communities secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Sun Communities secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
Sun Communities will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Sun Communities encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Sun Communities is protecting your information.
