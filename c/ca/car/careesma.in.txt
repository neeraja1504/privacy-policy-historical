1. Introduction
THIS IS A NEW PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS IN EFFECT AS OF December 13, 2018. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT THESE NEW TERMS.
Careesma ("Careesma") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our data and security practices and policies as you use Careesma's websites, apps and mobile services (the "Site" or "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data. The phrase "Personal Data" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms Of Use for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless separate terms are offered by you in writing and accepted in writing by Careesma.
Personal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that identifies you as a specific individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual. Please note that at all times Careesma will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and will indicate when it was most recently updated.

We also may collect aggregate demographic information. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Sites and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any Personal Data that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including our affiliated and parent companies, for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.
– When You Log In or Use Careesma from Some Third-Party Sites
You may also create an account or log in to your Careesma account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google. If you do not already have a Careesma account but log in to Careesma using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Careesma account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account. If you agree to provide this information to Careesma, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Careesma’s Site. Please note, when you log in to Careesma using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.

You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account. This information will be considered Careesma account information for purposes of your use of the Site.
You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Careesma account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account or from your Careesma account. Facebook may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Careesma, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.
PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.

Any Personal Data that Careesma may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by Careesma in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.
2.3 Storage of your Information

2.4 What Personal Data is Required
Careesma will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Careesma services or features to you. Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
2.5 The Basis on Which Careesma Collects Your Personal Data
Careesma collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved. More information is provided on this here.
- Performance of a Contract
Most of the Personal Data processed by Careesma is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.
- Legitimate Interest
A second ground relied upon by Careesma for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Careesma. Such legitimate interests will include where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention.
- Compliance with a Legal Obligation
A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Careesma comply with a legal obligation.
- Consent
Finally, in certain limited situations, Careesma relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data. Where Careesma requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
3. Limitation of Use or Disclosure of Personal Data
3.1 Where You Want to Close Your Account
When you close your account, you will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name. If you use the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to you again. Please also note that closing your account may result in you losing access to all Careesma products.
Careesma reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement). A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Careesma systems, although it will not be readily available under your original account name.
If you wish to access or delete your Personal Data held by Careesma, you should follow the steps listed in section 6 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.
3.2 Where You Want to Delete a Job Application

In the event that the electronic destination provided to Careesma by an Employer is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application. Careesma has no liability for such applications. If you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.
3.4 Children's Privacy
The Site is not for use by anyone under the age of 16. However if local laws require that you must be older in order for Careesma to lawfully provide the services in the Site to you then that older age shall apply as the applicable minimum age. In all jurisdictions outside the European Union, if you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must use Careesma under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian or responsible adult. Careesma adopts a range of measures to try to ensure that we do not accept individuals who do not meet the minimum age and any other applicable age requirements.

5. Information We Share
Careesma shares your Personal Data with Employers via a job application, and as detailed in section 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy. Employers agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules. Other than instances in which users opt to provide their Personal Data via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Data to anyone for any reason.
Where you use a third party integration to apply to a job from Careesma, your application will be processed in accordance with that third party’s terms.
Any resume or job application you sent to an Employer via a job application may be kept by the Employer, and you should check such Employer’s privacy policy to understand how they keep your Personal Data.
We also share your Personal Data with our service providers, including affiliated companies and our parent company, which are located in jurisdictions outside your own. This helps us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law. Any such sharing is performed in full compliance with applicable data protection rules and subject to appropriate safeguards, primarily through the use of extensive data protection agreements, in order to ensure adequate protection of users’ Personal Data. If you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use this Site. For example, where a user has uploaded a resume to the our Site or created one using Careesma’s products and has selected the “Share with Indeed” option, that resume may be shared with Indeed. For more information regarding Indeed’s privacy practices, please see itstheir Privacy Policy.
Careesma also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of Careesma or other users of the Sites. This means, for example, that Careesma may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.
Personal Data we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a bankruptcy or another corporate reorganization of Careesma. In addition, if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or in the event of any sale of assets or other transfer of ownership by Careesma to a third party (whether by merger, sale or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any of Careesma’s business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), the Personal Data we have collected may be transferred to such third party as well as such third party’s affiliates and subsidiaries, and may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Careesma is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction
9. How We Protect Personal Data
Careesma seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under Careesma’s control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. In addition, please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users, are not encrypted. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its security. Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies. Please see the section on International Data Transfers of this Privacy Policy for liabilities pertaining to the transfer of Personal Data of individuals in the EU and Switzerland.
