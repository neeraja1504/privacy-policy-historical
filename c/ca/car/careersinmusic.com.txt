What kinds of information do you collect from me?
The amount and type of information we gather depends upon your use of the website and, in some cases, what type of information you choose to disclose. We may collect the following information from you:
(a) Survey Information. We collect information from you when you voluntarily complete a CareersinMusic.com survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, we or a third party (a Third Party) may ask you to provide various information, which may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS/text messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS/text message), age, highest level of education, military status, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). We may also collect information concerning you from a third-party source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Website.
Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to us or a Third Party, but you may be offered or receive incentives from us in exchange for providing Survey Information.

When you use the Website, we automatically gather information made available by your web browser (such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome), Internet service provider (such as Comcast or Time Warner), and device (such as your computer, phone, or tablet), depending on your settings for each. For example, we may collect your IP address, information about the operating system or type of device you use, and the location of your device.

We may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”) when you complete certain surveys or place an order from CareersinMusic.com.
