Privacy Policy and Credit Card Security
CareerPlanner.com promises to keep all information about our clients totally private. We have been doing business on the Web since 1998, and we have never sold our Email lists, nor any other client information.
We hate SPAM as much as anyone and we value personal privacy. You can count on us to keep your information private.
This means that information about your education, your career, your test results, hobbies, phone numbers, Email address, postal address, and interests will be kept totally confidential.
The only exception is that if you are going through an independent career counselor or other organization to get your test results from us, they will of course have to have access to your test results.
We are here to help people plan, change or re-invent their careers. Our mission is to help people. It's that simple.
Information we collect while you are visiting our site
We collect normal "Web Statistics" as people visit our site. This is something almost all web sites do to improve the sites usability and reliability. Keeping a large web site running is a lot of work.
This means that while you are on our site we will record this information into what is called log files:
The pages you visit
The time you spend on each page
The time and date you visited a page
Your IP address
The URL of the site you were visiting before you came to us
The web browser you use

Why Do We Collect Age when you take tests and purchase reports?
As of 2009, CareerPlanner.com has developed new technology that allows us to provide better career advice based on one's age. This is pretty amazing stuff that will really help our clients who are approaching 40 years of age and those approaching 50 and over.
We stopped collecting date of birth a few years ago because it could be used in identity theft.
We do use cookies on CareerPlanner.com
We use cookies, which are tiny files that your web browser writes to your hard disk, when you visit certain pages on our site.
In these cookies we record things such as:
The date and time of your first visit to our site
Your personality type if you use our personality test
The reference id for any of our newsletters, emails or ads you clicked on
Other random computer codes our server uses
We do not collect the following type of information
We will not ask you for any of the following information which you might use elsewhere to protect your security on the web:
Social security number
Mother's maiden name
City you were born in
Name of favorite pet
Interest based advertising from Google and others
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_principles.pdf
Regarding Google Ads on our site:
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
Your credit card number is sent in encrypted form to our credit card processor.
This means humans can not read it. It also means that if someone is intercepting your internet traffic the card number is scrambled. No one can read it except our credit card processing company.
We use secure servers (SSL) and extra strong encryption.  On our site when you see the URL change from "http://" to "https:// "  all data transmission is encrypted so that other people snooping around the net can not read the data.
We also employ a special security service which attempts to hack into our web site. They do this several times each day. If they find a new weakness they warn us and we are required to improve our security within 48 hours.
Thus using your credit card on our site is very safe. In fact it is more safe than using your credit card at a restaurant or store where someone can easily write down all the information from your card.
We have been accepting credit cards over the internet for more than 10 years. The only time a customer thought there was a problem was when someone else in their family made the purchase without telling them.
As a final comfort, most credit card companies will drop a credit card charge if you tell them you never made the charge. They have to do this to stay in business.
