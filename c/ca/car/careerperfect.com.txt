CareerPerfectÂ® - Privacy Policy
CareerPerfect.com's Privacy Commitment - Overview
CareerPerfect.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.
The Following Reflects Our Commitment To You
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the CareerPerfect.com, Monster.CareerPerfect.com, and MonsterRes.CareerPerfect.com Websites.
Information About All CareerPerfect.com Visitors
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how CareerPerfect.com visitors use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.
Information About You Specifically
In some instances, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product or service, for example, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc. If you give us permission, we may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you or to contact you regarding site changes.
CareerPerfect.com also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration or ordering, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply send an e-mail to admin@CareerPerfect.com and type "remove" in the subject line.
During your visit to CareerPerfect.com, we may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.
General Information Disclosure
Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to CareerPerfect.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, personal references, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe it is required by law or to protect CareerPerfect.com, our users or others. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded order or registration page, such as that of a CareerPerfect.com and partner company-sponsored product, service, or contest, then your information becomes the property of both CareerPerfect.com and the partner co-sponsoring the product, service or contest. In that instance, the use of your personal information by our partner company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and CareerPerfect.com is not responsible for their use of your personal information.
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any third party.
Resumes
Your resume and all the information submitted for preparation of your resume is considered strictly private, and unless we believe we are required by law to do so, CareerPerfect.com will not disclose that information to anyone without your authorization, provided in accordance with your opt-out/opt-in elections at registration or upon ordering with us, or thereafter, consistent with your changes to such elections at any time.
Assessments
When you purchase a career planning software program and take the included assessments, all of your assessment results are strictly private, CareerPerfect.com will not disclose that information to anyone without your authorization. CareerPerfect will only provide to its career assessment publishing partners the information needed to score and provide you with your assessment results. CareerPerfect will never disclose your assessment results to any third party, unless we believe we are required by law to do so.
