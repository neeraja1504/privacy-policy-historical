Information Carsmart.com Collects
Carsmart.com collects e-mail addresses of consumers who communicate with us via e-mail. Information on web pages visited and other information volunteered by consumers such as survey information and/or site registrations are also collected. Information collected for purchase requests includes name, address, and phone numbers, e-mail address and specific vehicle information. Information collected for private ad listings includes name, zip code, phone number, email address, specific vehicle information, and credit card information.
Collected information is used to improve the content of our Web site, customize the content and/or layout of our Web site for individual users, notification of updates to our Web site and is also used to contact consumers for marketing purposes. Purchase request information is used to route requests to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners, and to contact consumers regarding vehicle purchases. This information may be shared with other reputable organizations only if the consumer gives permission. For private ad listings, only the vehicle information is made available to potential buyers. When a potential buyer wishes to contact the seller, the seller receives a notice and logs in to the CarSmart.com website to view potential buyer's name, phone number and email address. Credit card information collected for the private ad listings is used solely for charging the listing fee and is shared only with the third party credit card processing company, Verisign CFX Tag.
Who Owns Purchase Request Data?
Purchase Request information, including your name, e-mail address, home address and vehicle information, becomes the property of Carsmart.com once it is received in our database. This information is passed on to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners for completion of the sale pursuant to contractual rights granted by Carsmart.com. Once our accredited dealer receives this information, it becomes the property of the dealership in addition to Carsmart.com. Our accredited dealers use this information to process your purchase request and provide valuable services. Any request to opt out of future dealer communications must be made directly to the dealer.
