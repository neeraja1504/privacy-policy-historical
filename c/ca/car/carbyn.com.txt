Information Collection and Use on the Client Websites
Information Collected and How We Use It
We collect information (which may include login, password, or other personal information) via the Client Websites when you choose to provide it to us and/or from our Clients. In addition, you or our Client may provide demographic information (such as zip code, or age), or other information as part of registration, sign-in, completing surveys, or otherwise. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Client Websites. Please note that we do not control the data, we only act as a data processor of this data on behalf of our Clients. As a data processor, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any PII collected by us, unless you direct us to do so.
Synacor may work with third party service providers to augment some of the information you provide on the Client Websites. For example, if you have provided your email address via the Client Websites, we may work with a third party data company to determine your age and zip code, and add that information to our database.
Synacor uses the information provided to us in order to improve the quality of the Client Websites, provide you with customized content according to your preferences, and provide anonymous aggregate reporting for internal and external clients, including disclosing some aggregate information and user statistics to current and prospective clients, advertisers, and content partners in order to describe our services.
Synacor may also use e-mail addresses and other information to respond to users who communicate with us for support purposes or otherwise. If you choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and its responses.

This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Synacor uses Non-PII to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Client Websites.
Your IP address is not linked by Synacor to PII, but it is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve our Services. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of the Synacor Websites or Client Websites.
