This Privacy Policy is subject to the Carbonated.TV Terms & Conditions. Any issues or disagreements with this Privacy Policy or the Terms & Conditions are not to use the Carbonated.TV website and not upload or post any media, videos, comments, pictures, or any data whatsoever. The use of the Site after the Privacy Policy or Terms & Conditions has been modified, usage will signify acceptance of the changes that have been made and thus the new changes will govern usage and interaction with the Site.
This Privacy Policy explains how Carbonated.TV collects, uses, or otherwise processes information, including information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information when you use our website: https://www.carbonated.tv, including on a mobile device, mobile application and related services (the “Service” or the “Services”) or any other service to which this policy is linked.
Who is the Data Controller?
Carbonated.TV is the “data controller” of personal data collected by all of Carbonated.TV or its entities; and responsible for deciding how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed. Our advertisers or sponsors may also be data controllers of certain data you provide to them when you consume the content.
You should be aware that when you provide information to us using a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by the Carbonated.TV Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Site or Services. Please also keep in mind that our Site and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site or Services and to read the policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Although, we are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information.
