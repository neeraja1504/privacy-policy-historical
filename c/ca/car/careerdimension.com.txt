We work diligently to protect confidentiality, restrict transfer of personal data, incorporate technical safeguards and appropriate security policies, and identify privacy implications in new services. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you entrust to us.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
Our web site may log a user's IP address, browser type and version, dial-up domain, and computer operating system when he/she visits our site. We use the tracked information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses of our web site users are used to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic information that is not associated with any individual. Our web sites use an order form for customers to purchase our product and services. We collect customers' contact information (such as their address and email address) and financial information (such as credit card numbers). A valid certificate for conducting Internet commerce has been issued by Verisign, Inc to Career Dimensions, Inc. for this purpose. Contact information from the order form is used to send confirmation of orders to our customers. We may also provide future mailings regarding product information and releases. We may conduct surveys during which similar information will be collected and used for the same purposes listed above. Users may opt out of receiving any of these at any time. We reserve the right to aggregate or compile and use data obtained from the scoring of our assessments, and to utilize this data for research, product development, and statistical analysis. This data is only used in aggregate and never is associated with any individual's identity.

This information will be used to improve the user's online experience by delivering content specific information to the users. Users have the choice to accept, reject or be notified when a site sets a cookie by configuring their browser preferences.
SECURITY
When a user pays for an instrument or places an order online, the user's personal information and credit card information is processed and encrypted by offsite, secure servers using industry-standard SSL encryption.

DATABASE ACCESS
Institutional and corporate customers who purchase blocks of usage are provided with an institutional interface for managing their users and running reports.

Career Dimensions, Inc. assumes that individuals accessing this interface conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner.
