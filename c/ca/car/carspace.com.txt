Privacy Statement
Effective Date: December 23, 2019
California Residents: See California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights and Disclosure for additional disclosure about our use and collection of your personal information.
We gather certain types of information from and about the visitors to the Edmunds Automotive Network, and we believe our visitors should fully understand what information we gather from and about our visitors, and how we obtain, use, share and manage that information. The Edmunds Automotive Network consists of Edmunds.com and any other Web site that we identify as a part of the Edmunds Automotive Network; the mobile versions of our Web sites; any apps that we offer; and widgets, tools and content from our Web site that we offer for display on third-party web sites or apps.
This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather on the Edmunds Automotive Network and how we obtain, use, share and manage it. In addition, this Privacy Statement addresses our receipt and use of information that may be "Personal information" under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including Personal Information collected by us from sources other than the Edmunds Automotive Network.  With that exception, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to information that we obtain through any of our other business activities or from other sources.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, you should contact us through our Contact Us form.
Your Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
We collect information that you voluntarily submit to the Edmunds Automotive Network using one or more devices to receive products and services or related information that you request from either us or companies with which we do business. The information you submit may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number. We refer to such personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us in response to requests therefor on the Edmunds Automotive Network as your "PII."
Unless we have a street address (or equivalent) for you, we do not consider your city, state or ZIP code to be your PII.  We also collect information about the devices you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network as soon as you as you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network.  We do not consider this information to be your PII.  However, certain device information of California residents may be considered "Personal Information" under the CCPA.  California residents:  See "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights and Disclosures" below for more information.
Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Your PII will be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies, to fulfill your request and to provide other products and services to you.
In addition, if you provide your PII through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services or dealer communication services (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services"), your PII will be shared with vehicle dealers, and may also be shared with the vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and contractors, who may use that information to contact you. In addition, if the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service you use is "co-branded" ( i.e. , the page or screen on which it appears displays the name of both Edmunds and one of our partners), your PII may be shared with that partner. Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies or other entities, distributors, agents, contractors or partners use your PII.
If you use the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services to call, email, text or chat with a dealer, or if we otherwise act as an intermediary through which communications between a dealer and you are transmitted, a recording of your conversation, or the email, text or chat communications, between you and that dealer (as well as the phone number or email address from which you make such call or initiate such email, text or chat communications), will be made available both to us and that dealer (unless we choose to shield your email address or certain other information from that dealer), as well as any company requested by us or the dealer to facilitate those communications (including any social media website or application from which you initiate a communication). When we receive that phone number or email address, we may use it to obtain or associate additional information about you, and we may provide that additional information to the dealer and/or those other companies. In addition, that recording or email, text or chat communication, that phone number or email address, and that additional information, may be provided to vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and contractors.
We may use whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, to customize or enhance your experience on the Edmunds Automotive Network (including the display of advertisements) and to provide, or communicate with you concerning, our products or services or those of companies with which we do business. We may use this information to optimize the manner in which the products or services you requested are operated and managed or to optimize the operation and management of other product and services. We may also use this information for purposes of reporting and analytics, including demonstrating to the companies with which we do business the effectiveness of our products and services. We use city, state and ZIP code (which we assign based on your IP address) to display to you information customized for your region.
In addition, we may disclose whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, without first providing additional notification to you or obtaining your consent: (a) to third-party service providers that provide advice, products or services to us, or that assist us to improve our products, services or information, or to better understand their value to our visitors or to the companies with which we do business or are considering doing business; (b) in connection with any merger or acquisition of Edmunds or its parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by Edmunds to another entity; or (c) to other third parties if we determine that disclosure of such information (i) is or may be required by law or legal process, or is requested by a governmental agency, (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network Visitor Agreement, or to take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or its parent company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, our visitors or other third parties (including, when applicable, consumers, dealers and manufacturers).
From time to time, we may also receive information requests for, and disclose to third parties, portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used or other visitor information; that information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.
Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
In certain locations on the Edmunds Automotive Network where we obtain your PII, we may include a "check box" (or another process) for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive promotional and marketing communications and/or other information from other entities selected by us. By providing your consent (such as by "checking" the box, or leaving the box "checked"), you are agreeing to receive promotional and marketing communications from those other entities, and you are consenting to our providing your PII to those other entities.
If you no longer wish to receive promotional and marketing communications from us or our partners, you may do so (i) if you are an Edmunds Insider, by modifying your  profile, (ii) if you received a promotional or marketing email from us, by following the link for that purpose located at the bottom of the email, or (iii) by sending a request to us through our Contact Us form. However, withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that previously received your PII to continue to send communications to you and otherwise use your Personal Information.
If you are an Edmunds Insider, we may send you certain administrative and service messages in connection with the products and services available to you; you cannot opt out of receiving those communications, except as may be otherwise required under the CCPA or other United States law.
Updating Your Personal Information
If any of your PII submitted as a part of becoming an Edmunds Insider changes, you may update that information by logging into your profile. If you would like to modify any PII provided to the Edmunds Automotive Network through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services, or otherwise, please send a request to us through our Contact Us form.

In addition to use for our own internal business purposes described above, we may provide this information to, or share this information with, third parties, including third-party advertisers that display advertising on the Edmunds Automotive Network or third-party Web sites and online services with which we do business.  California residents: See "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights and Disclosures" below for more information.
Edmunds has not implemented a response to browser-based Do Not Track signals. Because of the current lack of consensus with respect to the Do Not Track standard from both a compliance perspective and a technical perspective, we have not yet determined if or how we would implement a response to Do Not Track signals. We will continue to evaluate this in the event a uniform standard is adopted.
Certain browsers may allow you to disable cookies. However, disabling cookies from the Edmunds Automotive Network may prevent you from using various features of the Edmunds Automotive Network.

The Edmunds Automotive Network may allow you to log into and associate your social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest, with the Edmunds Automotive Network. By using this functionality, you give the Edmunds Automotive Network permission to access all of the elements of your social media account information that you have made available to be shared, and to use it in accordance with the applicable social network's terms of use.
Your social media privacy settings may enable the Edmunds Automotive Network to retrieve information from your social media accounts, including your usernames, the date and time you sent messages using a social media application, and the contents of such messages.

Surveys
Occasionally we or another company on our behalf may conduct visitor surveys to better target our content to our audience, to improve our services and products, or for the benefit of third parties with which we do business. Accordingly, sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and other third parties. We never share any survey information about any identified individual with any third party unless that individual consents.
Our Community Services
The Edmunds Automotive Network provides a number of means by which you may communicate with other visitors and with us.  In certain instances, you must first become an Edmunds Insider and/or agree to our Visitor Agreement in order to add content to the Edmunds Automotive Network through certain services, such as our Forums (the Web's most established automotive message boards) and our Dealer Ratings & Reviews. The Visitor Agreement sets forth a number of information-sharing and disclosure practices for such services, and accordingly supplements this Privacy Statement.   All of your communications made to or through these services are referred to as "Visitor-Submitted Content." For information concerning our use of this and other Visitor-Submitted Content, please see our Visitor Agreement.
Links to Other Web Sites
The Edmunds Automotive Network contains links to many other Web sites and online services not operated by us, including sites where you can obtain automotive products and services. However, this Privacy Statement only applies to the Edmunds Automotive Network and the information we collect thereon, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any other Web sites or online services. For additional information about those links, please review our Visitor Agreement.
Third-Party Ad Servers and Advertisers
We use third party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements; to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement and site analytics; and to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time on the Edmunds Automotive Network and across other Web sites and online services. These advertising serving companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information) about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network in order to provide advertisements on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online services.
Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising
The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet. Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.
The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate Web sites, for the purpose of using such data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors. (The Program does not apply to a Web site's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a Web site.)
Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites and online services.
In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable Web site usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other Web sites and online services. To do this, we permit such third parties to place and use cookies on the browsers of our visitors, and use Web beacons and other tracking technologies on the Edmunds Automotive Network. These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across Web sites and online services.
Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one. To learn more about your choices and how to opt out from receiving the types of ads described above, please click here or paste http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ into your internet browser.
You may also opt out of tracking and receiving the types of ads described above on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and similar entities by modifying your device settings or downloading the App Choices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
Security
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your Personal Information, both during transmission to us and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. If you have any questions about security on the Edmunds Automotive Network, please use our Contact Us form.
