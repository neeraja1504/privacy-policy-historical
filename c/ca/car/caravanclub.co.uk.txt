We obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities, register with us, become a member or renew membership, send or receive email, make a donation of memorabilia to us, purchase products, ask a question or otherwise provide us with personal information.

Certain personal information is categorised by the Data Protection Act 1998 as ‘sensitive personal data’. In some circumstances, we provide you with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data, e.g. whether or not you are registered as disabled.

Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our digital services. For more information on this, please see our Use of Cookies policy.
