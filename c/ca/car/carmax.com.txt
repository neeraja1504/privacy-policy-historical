Thank you for visiting the CarMax website (including its mobile device-ready version) or using the CarMax mobile app. In this Privacy Notice, we refer to our websites and mobile app together as our “Online Services.” We hope that you find our Online Services to be a useful part of your car-buying experience. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect from consumers through our Online Services and in connection with our products and services, including when you visit our CarMax stores. This notice also describes how we use the information, with whom we may share it, the choices available to you regarding our use of the information, the measures we take to protect the security of the information, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
Please note that this Privacy Notice describes our overall privacy practices for our Online Services that link to this notice. The Privacy Notice does not apply to any website or mobile app operated by CarMax that has a separate privacy policy or notice. This Privacy Notice also applies to information about consumers collected in CarMax stores and in other ways.

We may obtain information from and about you in different ways. We obtain information from content you submit or provide to us through our Online Services (such as when you research a car) or in surveys, faxes, telephone calls, emails, and other correspondence; from information you provide when you register for a MyCarMax account; from information you provide to us when you test drive a car, buy a car from a CarMax store, have a car appraised, or sell a car to a CarMax store; from information you provide when you apply for financing; and from social media, such as social media handles, content and other data provided through third-party features (such as apps, tools, payment services, widgets, and plug-ins) or posted on social media pages (such as CarMax’s social media page or pages accessible to the public). The types of personal information we may obtain directly from you include:
Identifiers , such as name, username and password, phone number, fax number, email and postal address, Social Security Number, date of birth, driver’s license number, and social media handle;
Commercial information , such as information about the transactions you conduct with us (e.g., vehicle purchases, appraisals, and services), information about the vehicles that you have searched for or otherwise expressed or indicated an interest in, payment information you provide through our Online Services or in our CarMax stores, including billing address and payment card details (payment card number, expiration date and security code);

As a reminder, if you are a consumer who provides personal information to us in connection with our financing services, please read our Financial Privacy Policy.
Automated Collection of Data
When you visit or interact with our Online Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means. CarMax may use a variety of technologies to collect this information, such as browser cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. A browser “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with our Online Services and third-party digital services; (3) tailor our Online Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of our Online Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; (6) identify, diagnose and resolve technical issues; and (7) otherwise manage and enhance our Online Services, products and services.
The information we obtain in this manner may include:
Identifiers , such as your device IP address and identifiers associated with your devices and apps;
Online activities , such as dates and times of website visits and app use, content viewed, your search terms, and how you accessed the Online Services;
Geolocation data. When you use our Online Services, we may infer your location via your IP address or other information regarding your network connection. In addition, with your consent, our mobile device-ready website or mobile app (our “Mobile Services”) may collect precise information about the geographic location of your device. If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented using your device’s user interface, the geographic location of your device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that our mobile app is running (even if you are not actively using the app or it is minimized on your device). Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us (when it is open) until you set your device to no longer do so. You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing our app’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.

Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising
We collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and devices, including those websites and apps of third parties. We also work with third parties, such as ad networks and other service providers, that collect information about your online activities in this way. To do this, we (including the third parties) may use browser cookies, web beacons, flash cookies, unique identifiers associated with your devices and apps, and other technologies. The information collected via these technologies is described in the Automated Collection of Data section above.
We and certain third parties display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time and across devices and third-party websites, apps and platforms. Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on mobile apps. They might also be served in emails or other ways. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.
To decide what is relevant to you, we and certain third parties, such as our ad networks and other service providers, use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We and certain third parties gather this information using tracking tools, such as those described above. For example, we or the third parties may look at your browsing behaviors across devices. We and the third parties also may look at these activities on our apps and platforms and the platforms and apps of others.
We work with third parties who help gather this information and serve ads. These third parties might link your name, email address and other information to data they obtain. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.
Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to such “do not track” signals from browsers. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Options you select are browser and device specific.
To learn how to opt out of certain ad network interest-based advertising in the U.S., please YourAdChoices and Network Marketing Initiative websites. Choices you make may be browser and device-specific. In addition, your mobile device settings may allow you to limit your device from sharing certain information for advertising purposes. Learn more information on these types of settings by exploring Google Play Help - Advertising ID and limiting your Apple ad tracking.

California law requires that we describe certain disclosures of personal information where we receive valuable consideration.

In the course of supporting CarMax digital advertising activities, we “sell” information to digital marketing partners. They use this information to provide us with digital advertising services and may use the information to improve the services and offerings they provide to us and other businesses. The information we “sell” in this manner includes information collected when you engage with our website, mobile application, and other digital offerings.
