CarTalk.com may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.
Any information that you disclose when participating in the Car Talk Community (including creating a profile or submitting a comment to a story or blog or in a discussion thread or a recommendation posted to the Mechanics Files section), such as your full name and any nickname, is likely to become public. This information may be posted on the CarTalk.com Services. In addition, CarTalk.com may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the CarTalk.com Services, NPR and NPR-member-station web sites and services, other third party web sites and services, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms.

Excluding information provided by the user when participating in the Car Talk Community or sending User Materials to CarTalk.com, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by CarTalk.com is not provided to outside parties except, for limited purposes, NPR and NPR-member stations, CarTalk.com service vendors (such as the Shameless Commerce order fulfillment service, CarTalk.com's email list manager, and the provider of the tool that allows users to sign in using information from their account with a third party service), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email or otherwise share a story to that friend).
