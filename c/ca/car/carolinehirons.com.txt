Caroline Hirons: Legal/Privacy Policy
LEGAL STUFF
Advice
The views expressed on this site are the author's own and are provided for informational purposes only. The author makes no warranties about the suitability of any product or treatment referenced or reviewed here for any person other than herself and any reliance placed on these reviews or references by you is done so solely at your own risk. Nothing on this site shall be construed as providing dermatological, medical or other such advice and you are always advised to seek the advice of a suitable professional should you have any such concerns.
Affiliates
Some links may be affiliates. This is new to me so I'm monitoring how it goes. It doesn't affect my opinion at all, but then I think regular readers will know that. ;)
Any sponsored content prior to March 2016 is clearly labelled according to the ASA guidelines. As of March 2016 I am not accepting any sponsored posts.
Product Recommendations Disclaimer
I am always happy to recommend products and this has obviously become a key part of the blog and now YouTube. Any recommendation is based on my experience with something - or the trusted experience of a tester - but everyone's skin is different and something that works for me may not necessarily work for you in the same way.
The same with allergic reactions - it is impossible to anticipate allergies - it is pretty much possible for anyone to be allergic to anything.
Adverts
Adverts placed on here are done so by MODE Media and I have no affiliation with the companies featured.
