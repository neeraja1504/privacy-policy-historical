Collection of Personal Information
---|---|---
As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, screen name and email address.
When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see Who to Contact).
We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., a website might allow you to send an electronic "post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact the third party again unless and until the third party contacts us.

How We Use Your Information
---|---|---
When you supply us with your Personal Information we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample). It may also be used by the brand responsible for the website or promotion, as well as by our other brands, to contact you regarding other products and services which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). For more information about Unilever and its brands, see About Unilever. At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact. (See Who to Contact)
At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products and our web sites. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. Unilever does not sell Personal Information.
We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties. We do this for marketing purposes in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs.
We may also transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to any entity to which we divest all or a portion of our business (for example, in connection with our sale of a brand), to the extent that you provided such information to the specific portion of our business (or brand) that is being divested, or otherwise in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.
Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order.

Privacy of Children Online
---|---|---
Unilever is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and making the Internet safe for our users. The statements in this Policy generally about our collection and use of Personal Information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that follow. We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line.
Unilever does not collect personal information from children under 13, except from time to time at certain sites that are directed to children, such as popsicle.com. Unilever handles this information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):
If your child provides us with online contact information (e.g., an e-mail address) solely so that we may respond more than once to a specific request (e.g., sending an on-line newsletter) and for no other purpose, then we will notify you via e-mail that this information has been provided to us. You have the right, as will be outlined in our notification and as set forth below (see Who to Contact), to ask that we not use your child's online contact information for this purpose.
Before your child provides us with Personal Information beyond online contact information (e.g., a street address, phone number, etc.), or if we wish to use Personal Information for purposes other than responding more than once to a specific request, then we will contact you by e-mail and will require your signed permission, sent by real world mail, before we collect and use such information.
If the information provided by your child is online contact information only (e.g., an e-mail address), and it is to be used to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request (e.g., to answer a question about one of our products), and thereafter it is deleted from our records, then we will not notify you.

|
Security of Information
---|---|---
We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All personally identifiable information is subject to restricted access to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse.
|
|
Changes in Our Policy
---|---|---
Unilever reserves the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy at our discretion. We will post any new policy here and we encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed.
