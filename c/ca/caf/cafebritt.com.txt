Protecting Children
Cafe Britt takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our web site is a General Audience site. Don't forget, Cafe Britt is a great resource for all kinds of research projects on coffee. We'd love to hear from you and your children. Cafe Britt encourages children under 16 to get their parents’ permission before contacting us or submitting any information to us. Of course, there is nothing better than personal supervision of children while they surf the Internet.

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet.
