Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
CAIRO360 allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the CAIRO360Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the CAIRO360Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise the advertising content you see.
CAIRO360does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific programme or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks CAIRO360 to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men aged 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men aged 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the CAIRO360Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt out of certain practices. CAIRO360’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers, which is subsequently shared with CAIRO360, is maintained and handled by CAIRO360 in accordance with this privacy policy.
The current list of third-party ad servers or ad networks that CAIRO360 has a relationship with is available here:
