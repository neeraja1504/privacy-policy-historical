We recognize that privacy is important to you as visitor to and user of our website Calendarpedia.com. We also understand the concerns about the use of personal data. This page outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Calendarpedia.com, how we use it, and the steps we take to safeguard and protect this information. We hope this will enable you to make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us.

Personal Information
Calendarpedia.com collects personally identifiable information from visitors to this website only on a voluntary basis and only when a visitor contacts us via the contact form or by e-mail. The only personal information collected in the contact form is your name and e-mail address. Both of these pieces of information are voluntary, and you're not required to enter this information into the contact form in order to contact us (however, if you would like us to be able to reply to you, please give us your e-mail address). Calendarpedia.com will use personal information received from you for internal purposes only and will never sell, rent, distribute, provide or give your information to any third party, nor will it be used in any way other than to respond to your enquiry and/or notify you of updates to Calendarpedia.com relating to your enquiry. We also collect each visitor's IP address, which helps us combat spam and fraud. We do not use IP addresses for any other purpose.
Any personally identifiable information that we may collect from you is held securely to prevent any unauthorised access and/or disclosure to third parties.
If we make material changes in the collection of personally identifiable information, we will inform you by placing a notice on our site.
If you have provided us with personal information and would like to update or correct that information, or have the information we hold on you deleted from our records, please contact us.

We collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, such as web server data and your IP address.
