Through customer surveys, subscriptions, and newsletter registrations, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used, among other things, to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters. Contact information is also used to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the choice/opt-out section below. This site contains links to other sites. CallFerret.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or any website from which you may have linked to CallFerret.com.
CallFerret.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read this privacy policy to fully understand how we will make use of the personal information you share with us. CallFerret.com collects certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal information is gathered when you register to receive certain CallFerret.com products or services. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information contained in your registration data or related data, provided that, such information will NOT include personally identifying information, except as specifically authorized by you or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce the terms of service. CallFerret.com will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, and any service-related activities such as collecting subscription fees from you for those services, and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. In this regard, it may be necessary for CallFerret.com to disclose your personal information to one or more agents and contractors of CallFerret.com and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors, and subcontractors will be required to agree to use the information obtained from CallFerret.com only for these purposes. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. CallFerret.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your CallFerret.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, CallFerret.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. CallFerret.com reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the CallFerret.com web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of us.
Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.
