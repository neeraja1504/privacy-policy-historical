Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Privacy Policy or as specifically required by law, any communication or material you provide to us, whether received online, electronically, in person or otherwise collected by or submitted to us, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions or the like, is, and will be treated as, non-proprietary.

We comply with the US Federal CAN-SPAM Act, and make every effort to ensure that our messages are not considered Spam. Of course, you may unsubscribe from any messages we send at any time and you will not receive further electronic messages from us after following the instructions included within the message.
We may provide you with an “opt-in” or “opt-out” mechanism depending on where you are located when we collect your personal data. An “opt-in” mechanism will provide you the opportunity to positively indicate that you would like or do not object to our sending you such further communications and we will not send you any unless you have “opted-in." An “opt-out” mechanism will provide you the opportunity to indicate that you do not want us to send you such further communications, and if you “opt-out” we will not send you any. Either way, opting-in or opting-out will be up to you and, in addition, if you do not want us to use your personal data for a particular purpose or disclose it to a third party, you may “opt-out” at any time by contacting us as provided below.
Information transmitted over the Internet may find its way to recipients to whom it is not intended or persons you may not want to have such information.

Lennar builds homes and communities in the United States and we follow the information and consumer protection laws of the United States and its individual states. If you reside or are located in a different country, the data protection laws of that country may differ as to what, and how, personal information is protected. We want you to understand that when you provide your personal information to us, or we obtain your information through the Properties or other communications with us, you consent to our processing your information in the United States, subject to U.S. laws, and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
The personal data you submit to Lennar will be transferred to the United States for the purposes described above which involve (1) fulfilling a request you submit to us for information about our services, (2) implementing pre-contractual measures at your request (such as processing your request for information about home buying opportunities in communities that interest you or an application you submit for mortgage financing), (3) enabling the performance of a contract you enter into with Lennar; or (4) pursue our legitimate interests in a manner that does not override your privacy rights.
We retain personal information for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes. When we no longer have a legitimate business interest in keeping your personal information, we securely delete or destroy it. In determining data retention periods, Lennar takes into consideration applicable laws, contractual obligations, and what we reasonably believe are your expectations and requirements. For example, if you purchase a home, we will retain your information for as long as you own your home and as long as required by our contracts and by law. If you submit an information request, we will retain your contact and preferences information and consider our relationship to remain active for marketing purposes after fulfilling any request you submit and until we take note that you no longer show interest in our products or services. If you request information regarding the personal information that we hold about you, we will make a reasonable effort to fulfill your request. Note that if you submitted an "opt-in" to allow transfer of your personal information to a vendor or other non-affiliated third party, we will not be able to take any action with respect to personal information under the control of such third party and you will need to submit your request directly to that third party.
