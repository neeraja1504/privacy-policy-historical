Effective Date: December 1, 2016
Thank you for downloading our application ("App") or visiting our website, located at www.CallerSmart.com ("Site" or "Website"). This policy covers how the information you enter into our Site or App is handled by our Company. Both the Site and App are property of Caller Smart Inc. ("Company ," "We" or "Us").
We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices, specifically as it relates to your use of the Site or App. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage.
We understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy and have designed our Site and App with this in mind. That's why We do not rent, sell, share, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.
In general, We reserves the right to release current or past Site or App data: (a) in the event that we believe that the Site or App is being or has been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions, or to commit unlawful acts; (b) as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site or App; or (c) if Company is sold or acquired.
While Company strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Company is not responsible for the information practices of third-parties. The collection, use and disclosure of information by clients, partners, and any other third party is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.
Cookies

Thereafter, We may access our Cookies on your computer or mobile device. This helps enhance your experience with Us, and in many instances is necessary for the provision of the services offered on the Site or in the App.
We use Cookies to store your passwords, so that you do not have to enter it more than once and to enhance your experience on the Site and in our App. We do not link the information we store in Cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site or in our App.

Clear GIFs
In addition to Cookies, our third party tracking utility company may employ a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) and collects usage data.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. They help us better manage content on our Site or in our App by informing us what content is effective with our users.
