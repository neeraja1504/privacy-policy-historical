1. Information We Collect.
There are several ways we may obtain information about you, including through (A) information you provide to us directly; and (B) information that we automatically collect. This includes data that identifies you personally whether directly (e.g., your name) or indirectly (e.g., information about your online use).
Information You Provide
Outlook collects personal information from you when you choose to share it with us. This may include when you create an online account with us, talk to a psychic, enter contests, participate in surveys, subscribe to a service (like our horoscopes), take quizzes, post to message boards, participate in a chat room, request information from us, or otherwise contact us. The types of personal information that may be collected on these pages include name, address, age, date of birth, gender, e-mail address, telephone number, credit or debit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various services.
We do not ask for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile services.
Information Automatically Collected
As is true of most websites, we may use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, scripts, log files, or local shared objects (Flash cookies/HTML5), to automatically or passively collect certain information about visitors to our Sites and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to allow Outlook to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information which enables Outlook to improve its Sites and provide you with more relevant content and advertising on our Sites and other sites.

We partner with third party advertising networks to display advertising on our Sites and to manage our advertising on other sites. Some of our advertising partners, marketing affiliates, or analytics providers may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (Flash cookies/HTML5) when they advertise on our Sites, which may send these advertisers information including your non-personal information. We do not have access to, or control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

Combination of Information
We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including information you provide to us and information we automatically collect through our Sites, as well as information collected from other online sources or from third party sources (including social networks that you use to connect with Outlook) to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our Sites.
2. How We Use the Information.
Outlook may use the information we collect from and about you for a variety of business purposes, as discussed below. We are committed to protecting and maintaining the privacy of your information. Therefore, we will process your data only in accordance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.
We will have a lawful basis for processing your data if:
We need to process your information in order to provide you with the products or service you have requested or to enter into a contract;
You have consented to such processing;
We have a legitimate interest for processing your data – e.g., for fraud prevention; network and information systems security; data analytics; enhancing, modifying or improving our services; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns; and personalization of the service using data to make it easier and faster for you to place orders; and/or
We are required to do this by law (for example, where it is necessary to retain it in connection with potential litigation).
Outlook may use the information we collect from and about you for any of the following purposes:
To provide you with the services that you have requested. For example, if you sign up for horoscopes we will send you horoscopes, or if you have entered a contest and win, we will send you an email notification that you have won.
To respond to your inquiries, fulfill orders, and contact and communicate with you when necessary;
To develop new products or services and to conduct analysis to enhance current products and services;
To review the usage and operations of our Sites and improve the design and content of our Sites;
To personalize your experience on the Sites and provide you with customized content, targeted offers, and advertising on the Sites or via email;
To contact you with information, newsletters, and promotional or other marketing materials offering products or services from Outlook or on behalf of our partners, affiliates, or subsidiaries that we think you may be interested in;
To use your data in an aggregated non-specific format for analytical and demographic purposes (this processing may involve profiling – for example to create audiences based on demographic or location based information for marketing and customization purposes);
To address problems with the Sites or our business;
To manage our telecommunications networks;
To protect the security or integrity of the Sites and our business;
As otherwise described to you at the point of data collection; and
To use and disclose your credit/debit card or payment account information only to process payments and prevent fraud
Additionally, if you use the Sites to connect with third party services you authorize us to use information from and about you, on your behalf, to interact with these third party services based on your requests.
3. How We Share Your Information.
Sharing of Information by You
The Sites offer many ways to find, enjoy, and share content. Your activity in connection with the Sites may include filling out surveys, reviewing and rating products or services, inquiring about or using our services, participation in online communities, "liking" or "sharing" our content to your social media accounts or pages or otherwise interacting with the Sites. Any information you may disclose on our Sites, in blogs, on message boards, in chat rooms, or on other public areas on the Sites or other third-party websites, applications, or services that the Sites may link to, becomes public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas.
Sharing of Information by Us
We will share or disclose the information we collect from and about you with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to unaffiliated third parties. We will only share your information in the following ways:
(a) if it is for the purpose(s) for which you provided the information;
(b) with your consent;
(c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company, to protect others from injury, or on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request, when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another, or when we believe that someone has violated our Terms and Conditions;
(d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out business, professional or technical support functions for us (e.g., service providers - see below); and/or
(e) with our affiliated companies, subsidiaries, or divisions.
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, affiliates, assets, or other business units. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through the Sites in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Outlook may also share aggregate or anonymous non-personal information with third parties, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies, for their marketing or analytics uses.
Sharing with Service Providers
Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your information in the course of providing products or services to Outlook. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us various products and services, including, but not limited to, credit card processing, e-mail distribution technology, live operator services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Sites. Access to your information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for Outlook. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors (1) protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2) not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services, except as required by law.
Our Psychics/Your Privacy
Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed directly by Outlook. We contractually require that our psychics protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing you with the services you request through the Sites or by phone. You should also take care to protect your personal information and privacy. There is no reason that you should provide any of our psychics with personal contact information, specific financial information, including, but not limited to, account numbers or other confidential information related to your identity. It is a violation of our Terms and Conditions for you to be in direct contact with any of our psychics outside the service – if you do so, Outlook bears no liability for any resulting actions, and your ability to use our services may be revoked.
4. Your Rights and Choices.

Outlook collects various types of personal information about you, both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Outlook for information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this California Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our "family" of companies, such as those companies we own, that own us, or under common control with us. To make such a request, please send an email to Privacy@californiapsychics.com.
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing Privacy@californiapsychics.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
5. Retention of Your Data
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to address outstanding account balances, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
6. International Transfers
Outlook is a global business and it, or its service providers, may process, transfer, and store information about our users on servers located in a number of countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States. Since we are committed to protecting your information, we take steps to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in place when we transfer that data.
7. How We Secure Your Information
Outlook is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and generally accepted standards to guard your nonpublic personal information, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can contact us at Privacy@californiapsychics.com.
8. Testimonials
We display personal testimonials of customers on our Sites in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at Privacy@californiapsychics.com.
9. Third Party Content, Links, and Plug-ins
Our Sites include links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Outlook. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites, and encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
The Sites may offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, such as the Facebook Like and Share buttons, and other widgets and interactive mini-programs that run on our Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins, and are not responsible for the practices of such sites. In addition, we may receive certain information about you from a third party social network if you choose to link to us or use certain social media features, based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party services.
10. Send to a Friend
If you choose to use our referral function to tell a friend about our Sites, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Sites. Outlook stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at Privacy@californiapsychics.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
11. Children's Privacy
Protecting children's privacy is important to us. Our Sites are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. Outlook does not knowingly collect or store personal information from anyone under the age of 16. Premium services may not be used by anyone under the age of 18. If you have concerns about our Sites or the services offered on our Sites, or if you believe that your child under 16 has gained access to our Sites, you may contact us at Privacy@californiapsychics.com.
12. Revisions to this Privacy Policy
Outlook reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, remove, or otherwise revise portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post the change(s) on the Sites. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes. If we change the Privacy Statement in a material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you.
