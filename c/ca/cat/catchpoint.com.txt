• The information that is automatically provided by the visitor’s computer browser (“Browser Information”), such as the computer operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (from which we can infer a visitor’s location), time and day of access, browser type and language, and the website the consumer visited before visiting the Corporate Website;

How information about visitors is collected by the Corporate Website and Platform Interface
The Corporate Website and Platform Interface use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above.
Cookies
Cookies are used to respond, by way of example, to a visitor’s request for more information about the Catchpoint Services or for a free trial. Cookies also authenticate the username and password of a Catchpoint Services User entered by that Catchpoint Services User in the Platform Interface. Some cookies are set by the Corporate Website and the Platform Interface to permit our service providers to perform services on our behalf. Any information transferred to our service providers is governed by our agreements with those service providers.
Embedded are used to measure the pages and features of the Corporate Website used by visitors. Embedded scripts are also used by Catchpoint’s service provider to collect the name, email address and company affiliation of Catchpoint Services Users.
Web beacons (or tags or pixels) are used to transfer information between a visitor’s browser and the computers of Catchpoint’s service providers in order to power some features of the Corporate Website (for example, to automate requests for further information, and to enable web analytics) on Catchpoint’s behalf.
How Catchpoint uses the information it collects from the Corporate Website and Platform Interface
Catchpoint uses the information collected through the Corporate Website for the purposes for which such information was provided. For example, if you share your name and contact information with us when submitting a request for a free benchmark or an inquiry through our website, we will use this information to respond to you and provide you with the services or information requested. Where we seek and obtain your consent to engage in these processing activities, we will rely on such consent to process your personal data until you withdraw it. In other cases, we will process your personal data as necessary to perform our contractual obligations with you or to otherwise provide the requested services or information.
Catchpoint uses the information collected from the Corporate Website as necessary for its legitimate business purposes. Depending on the context, Catchpoint can use the information collected to respond to a visitor’s request, to communicate with visitors about Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services, or to otherwise operate, manage, secure and improve Catchpoint, the Corporate Website, and the Catchpoint Services.
Catchpoint’s use of the information collected from the Platform Interface is limited to providing the Catchpoint Services which its customers have engaged. For example, the information is used to allow Catchpoint Services Users to log into the Platform Interface, to provide support, training and other services related to the Catchpoint Services, to optimize the user experience on the Platform Interface, to understand how a Catchpoint Services User interacts with the pages and features of the Platform Interface, and otherwise to operate, manage, and improve Catchpoint, the Platform Interface, and the Catchpoint Services. We will process this information as necessary for our legitimate business interests or as necessary to perform our contractual obligations with our customers. With the exception of information collected in connection with Catchpoint Services Users’ registration or authentication into the Catchpoint Services, this Privacy Policy does not apply to Catchpoint’s security and privacy practices in connection with access to and use of the Catchpoint Services.

If you have given consent, you can reverse that consent at any time.
Catchpoint Services
Information collected by the Catchpoint Services about consumers
The Catchpoint Services measure the performance of our customers’ websites, web apps and web services (each, a “Web Property”) by testing speed, reliability and availability. With the exception of the following, the Catchpoint Services run tests that model a hypothetical consumer’s experience on a customer’s Web Property using equipment located worldwide that is managed by Catchpoint Systems. In addition, the Catchpoint Service known as “Real User Measurement” (the “RUM Service”) is used by Catchpoint’s customers to measure a consumer’s actual experience of a Web Property. The RUM Service measures how fast a web page and its components load on a consumer’s browser to provide web developers with information to improve speed and reliability, and to detect and fix errors. With the exception of the RUM Service, the Catchpoint Services do not measure or collect information about actual consumer visits or actual consumers.
In connection with providing the RUM Service to a customer, Catchpoint collects the following information about a consumer from a customer’s Web Property:
• Browser Information; and
• Information about a consumer’s usage of the Web Property that our customer asks Catchpoint to collect, which can include, for example, factors such as the number of visits, the number of page views per visit, whether the visit results in a purchase or other transaction, and whether the Web Property produced any errors during the visit.
How the RUM Service collects information about consumers
Catchpoint Services use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above. Cookies are used to associate a consumer’s web browser with the information our customers specify. Embedded scripts are used to measure how a consumer uses a Web Property. Web beacons are used to transfer information between the cookies and Catchpoint computers.
In addition, Catchpoint Services is authorized by our customers to set a Catchpoint cookie on our customers’ Web Properties in connection with providing the RUM Service. These cookies are used by the RUM Service to recognize a returning visitor, and to determine the number of unique visitors to a Web Property.
