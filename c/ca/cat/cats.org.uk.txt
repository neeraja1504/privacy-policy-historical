Why do we collect your information?
Cats Protection has a legal basis for processing your personal information in relation to the reasons you have submitted your details these include:
When we have your consent to process your information for a specific purpose, for instance:
to respond to your requests for specific services, products and information
to contact you in relation to all purposes where you have consented
When the processing is in relation to a contract we may have with you, for instance:
to process your donation, Gift Aid or membership – and any queries or issues that may arise in connection with this processing
to manage your purchase orders, delivery of products and communicate with you about those orders
to process the data of and communicate with Cats Protection staff and volunteers in relation to the roles they carry out for the charity
When the processing is necessary in order for us to comply with a legal obligation, such as data protection and any other applicable legislation, for instance;
to record any contact we have with you so that we can manage any queries or complaints
to provide an increased level of security for the benefit of those who work in or visit CP premises
to prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website
When we exercise our legitimate interest to raise the charity’s profile, awareness and funds to support the welfare of cats in our care, by:
keeping you up-to-date on CP’s news such as fundraising campaigns, challenges, achievements etc
enabling third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other legitimate functions on our behalf, or
conducting research on the demographics, interests and behaviour of our supporters to enable a better understanding of your requirements. This allows CP to identify areas for improvement in providing our services and make communications as relevant as possible. If this research is conducted by a third party CP will ensure that all personal information will be processed in accordance with data protection law
making a decision, on the basis of a supporter’s level of giving and postcode, whether to send different communications to people who might choose to give higher donations. Where a supporter is identified as being potentially able and willing to give more than they already do, we may try to build a better understanding of how they might want to support us. To do this we conduct in-house research and may use additional, publicly-available information from third party sources where it is available, such as Companies House and Land Registry records. This allows us to make sure we are spending your donations effectively, by using research and analysis to inform our decisions and ensure our conversations with you provide the best supporter experience possible
CP will never swap or sell your details. When dealing with your personal information we will always comply with the current UK data protection law and any other applicable legislation.
We will only use your personal information for direct marketing purposes if we are permitted to do so by law or if we have your consent. For more information on direct marketing go to Marketing communication. The law does permit us to send marketing mail (post) without prior consent until you opt-out of this service which you can do at any time.
