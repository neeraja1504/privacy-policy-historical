We can tell the type of computer and web service that you are using, as well as the date, time, and pages that you visit. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information (for example, the number of people who logged into the Website in a particular day).
We may use Aggregate Information for internal purposes, such as tracking demographic data and providing targeted content to make the Website more useful to our visitors. The gathering of this Aggregate Information may be accomplished by the use of cookies or web beacons by us and our third party service providers. In particular, we will collect an IP address from all visitors to the Website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We may share Aggregate Information with our content providers, service providers or other third parties without restriction. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Website, analyze trends, track users’ movement on the Website, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Website, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses, however, are not linked to Personal Information. We also may use a unique assigned number located with the Website’s URL to determine the website from which you navigated to get to the Website. While this number may not be apparent to you, it does not contain your Personal Information.
USE OF THIRD PARTIES SERVICE PROVIDERS
In certain cases, we may use third parties to fulfill orders, including shipping, name and address verification, process payments, monitor Website activity, conduct surveys, and administer emails, sweepstakes, and contests. We only share information needed in order for these companies to perform the services requested and they are contractually obligated to protect this information and use it for no other purpose. If you do not want your information collected by us or by third parties for these purposes, you can decide not to participate in these activities. We do not authorize third parties to make additional use of your information. Except as described above, we do not share, rent, or sell information that is collected online to any non-affiliated third party.

DATA SECURITY
We are committed to providing reasonable and appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against foreseeable hazards such as data loss, destruction, misuse and improper disclosure.

Online information such as your credit or debit card account number is transmitted through a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. You can check the security of your connection by looking at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. An unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) means the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also look at the URL address. If the first characters of the website address change from “http” to “https,” then you have accessed a secure server. Note, however, that absolute security can never be guaranteed. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures utilized in connection with the Website.

If you receive an email that appears to be a request from us for Personal Information, do not respond, as this may be a “phishing” scam designed to steal your information. Never include your credit or debit card number or other sensitive information in an email, as it is not a secure means of transmitting information. We will only request such information during secure transactions through our Website. It is your responsibility to safeguard any password you create to access “My Account” and to sign-out when your visit is complete.
