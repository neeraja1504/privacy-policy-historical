Catch News and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:
The information - name, sex, age, address, pin code, contact number, occupation, interests and email address etc. - that you submit to register for a Catch News Service, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes is called Registration Information.
These consist of comments or content that you post to Catch News. This may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public information and posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
We may collect additional information when you provide feedback, change your content or email preferences, respond to a survey, or communicate with us.
When you choose any subscription or paid service, we, or our payment gateway provider, may collect your purchase address or billing information, including your credit card number and expiration date, etc. However, when you order using an in-app purchase option, the same is handled by the platform providers. The subscriptions or paid Services may be on auto renewal mode, unless cancelled. If at any point you do not wish to auto-renew your subscription, you may cancel your subscription before the end of the subscription term.
We may receive information about you from other sources, add it to our account information and treat it in accordance with this policy. If you provide information to the platform provider or another partner, whom we provide services, your account information and order information may be passed on to us. We may obtain updated contact information from third parties in order to correct our records and provide Services or communicate with you.
We may refer to other sources of information to provide you with targeted communications and promotions. We use Google Analytics, among others, to track user behaviour on our Website. Google Analytics has been enabled to support display advertising and help us understand our users' demographics and interests.
The reports are anonymous and cannot be associated with any individual or personally-identifiable information that you may have shared with us. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings options provided by Google.
To enhance the responsiveness of the application and to enhance your experience on our Services, we may place 'cookies', or similar electronic tools on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a user identification (User ID), to understand the user's individual interests. Cookies do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information unless you voluntarily choose to give the information to us by registering on one of our services. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data from your hard drive.
Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but you can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser.
If a user opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique Double Click cookie ID on the user's browser is overwritten with the phrase 'OPT_OUT'. Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser.
We automatically collect information, though limited, about your computer's connection to the internet, mobile number, including your IP address, when you visit our Website, Application or Service. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet know where to send your data - such as the pages you view.

We may also collect log information from your device, including your location, IP address, your device's name, device's serial number or unique identification number (e.g. UDiD on your iOS device), your device operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection speed etc.
