Privacy Policy [Catholic-Hierarchy]
This site is owned and operated by David M. Cheney. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Catholic-Hierarchy.org, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
Information Catholic-Hierarchy.org Gathers and Tracks
This website gathers two types of information about users:
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to provide feedback on this website.
Information this website gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because this website derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does this website divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.
Usage tracking
This website tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. This website does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
This website sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
Cookies
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This website uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Third-party advertisers may use cookies to better track ad impressions and click rates.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.
