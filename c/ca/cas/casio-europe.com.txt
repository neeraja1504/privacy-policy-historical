Notes on lawfulness and period of storage
Lawfulness of the processing of personal data
If we obtain your consent for the processing operations of personal data, Article 6 (1) a) GDPR is the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
With regard to the processing of personal data which are required to perform a contract with you, Article 6 (1) b) GDPR is the relevant legal basis. This also applies to processing operations which already become relevant precontractually.
If processing of your personal data is required to fulfil one of our legal obligations , Article 6 (1) c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
In the event that vital interests on your part or in the case of another natural person are interfered with which make a processing of personal data necessary, Article 6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis for this processing.
If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party and your interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not override our legitimate interest, Article 6 (1) f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.
We do not exercise any automated decision-taking in relation with the processing of personal data through the CASIO website.
Storage period and erasure of data
The personal data collected, processed and stored by us will essentially only be stored for such time as demanded by the concrete purpose of storage. If the purpose of storage/processing ceases to apply, i.e., when we no longer need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or statutory obligations, your data will be erased or anonymized.
However, the situation may furthermore arise where European regulations, applicable national laws or other regulations (e.g. regulatory obligations) require that the data processed by us be retained for a longer period of time, e.g. statutory retention periods which can result from, e.g. Commercial Code, Tax Code and usually contain retention periods from 6 to 10 years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation, which is usually three years but can be up to thirty years. When these retention periods expire, we delete or anonymize your data.
Your rights
Insofar as we process your personal data, you are a "data subject" as contemplated by the GDPR. As a data subject, you may have the following rights in respect of CASIO. To exercise your rights please contact us as stated in Section 2.
Right of access regarding processing
You can within the framework of the statutory provision request from us information as to whether personal data are processed by us. If this is the case, you have the right to request information about the extent of the data processing. The access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right to obtain such copy.
The right of access is limited pursuant to Section 34 FDPA. The right of access does e.g. not apply if the data (a) were recorded only because they may not be erased due to legal or statutory provisions on retention, or (b) only serve the purposes of monitoring data protection or safeguarding data, and providing information would require a disproportionate effort, and appropriate technical and organizational measures make processing for other purposes impossible.
Right to rectification ("Right to be forgotten")
You may have a right to have your data corrected by CASIO if the processed personal data concerning you are incorrect. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
Right to restriction of processing
If the preconditions exist for this, you can request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. In this case, the respective data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
Right to erasure
Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain from us to erase of personal data concerning you and we may be obliged to erase such personal data. Such right to erasure does pursuant to Section 35 FDPA, for instance, not apply if in the case of a non-automated processing erasure would be impossible or would involve disproportionate effort due to the specific mode of storage and if your interest in erasure can be regarded as minimal. In such case, you may have the right to restriction of processing.
Right to data portability
Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to CASIO in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Furthermore, you have the right to communicate these data to another controller without hindrance from CASIO provided the preconditions exist for this.
Right of objection
You have the right for reasons arising from your particular situation at any time to lodge an objection against the processing of the personal data concerning you that occurs on the basis of Article 6 (1) e) or f) GDPR.
The consequence of your an objection is that CASIO will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
In the event that we undertake marketing in respect of yourself, you have the right at any time to lodge an objection against the processing of the personal data concerning you for such promotional purposes. You can notify us of your objection using the following contact details:

As soon as you permit your web browser to approve the website with an active click, the browser transmits data (degrees of longitude and latitude) to the Google location service to determine your approximate location. The browser then releases this information for the querying CASIO website so that CASIO can display the right specialist dealer for you.
