Please read on to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting castle.comâ€™s website at castle.com.com or any of our other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, or using any of our services (collectively, the â€œServicesâ€), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.
WHAT THIS IS SAYING

You are responsible for any Content (as that term is defined in our Terms of Service) you provide in connection with the Services.

WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
This Privacy Policy explains how castle.com collects and uses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of personally identifiable information (â€œPersonal Informationâ€). References to â€œPersonal Informationâ€ in this Privacy Policy shall apply to personal information of individual users of the Services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers castle.comâ€™s treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to castle.com through a third party website or service using a castle.com application. This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that we do not own or control.
WHAT THIS IS SAYING
Hereâ€™s what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while youâ€™re using castle.com. This policy doesnâ€™t cover 3rd party companies that we donâ€™t control but who help us operate our service. Keep reading, thereâ€™s more about this later!
HOW IS CHILDRENâ€™S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?
We have included some information below related to the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy and Protection Act (â€œCOPPAâ€). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (â€œunder age usersâ€). Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an underage userâ€™s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the castle.com Services, and we may collect the underage userâ€™s parentâ€™s (or legal guardianâ€™s) email address in order to provide notice to parents that we may contact their underage user for the purpose of providing the Services. If castle.com does not receive the parentâ€™s email address within a reasonable time period, the underage user will not be able to receive any messages and his/her personally identifiable information will be deleted. If an underage userâ€™s castle.com account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), castle.comâ€™s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an underage user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an underage user has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that an underage user may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at report@castle.com. ****
WHAT THIS IS SAYING
castle.com collects limited personal information from users under 13, and notifies a parent or guardian when collecting personal information from users under 13 years old. We will delete their personal information if the childâ€™s account does not have an associated email address from a parent or guardian, or if the account has been inactive for at least 12 months. Any questions or concerns? Just email us! contact@castle.com
