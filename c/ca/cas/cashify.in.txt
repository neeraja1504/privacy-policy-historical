Cashify strives to give the best offers to sell your old gadget; then Cashify refers you to a buyer for your product. We will share your personal information with these carefully selected buyers only when you agree to submit for a quote. This means we do not take your credit card/debit card information and we do not take your money. Registration on Cashify is voluntary; if you do decide to register, we will not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote. Subject to your registration, you do get access to certain features, but membership is not necessary to find sale offers. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us.
