Why we need your Personal Information
The main reason we use your Personal Information is to provide you with the products or services you have requested, to deal with your queries, or consider or process any loan or other application you make and to collect any payments when due. If you apply to us for a loan, we will collect some necessary Personal Information about you from other people, such as credit reference agencies and your employer so we can check details you have provided to us and your credit worthiness.
How we use your Personal Information
We may share your details with group and external service providers who help us to provide agreed services to you, such as website hosting providers or companies hosting consolidated customer databases. We may also share your details where necessary with other members of our group of companies and its franchisees where needed for management authorisations or approvals, to administer our systems, investigations or where they are involved in the financing or securing of arrangements you have requested.
For certain products, we will make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, for use in the assessment of credit products and other information, as well as information from the Electoral Register, for the purpose of verifying your identity. The agencies will record details of the search type, credit or identification, whether or not this application proceeds. We may use credit-scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. We may also contact your employer to verify your employment status. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us and other companies if credit decisions are made about you, or other members of your household. Any of this information may also be used for identification purposes, debt tracing, debt recovery and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.
For certain products, we may make periodic searches of credit reference agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we may give details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on-time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt. Please see Part 2 of this privacy policy for further details.
We will retain information on unsuccessful or aborted applications for our products and services for up to six years following the application.

Will my personal information be transferred abroad?
The personal information you provide to us is processed in the UK. It may be transferred to other group companies and to franchisees as described in previous paragraphs. Some of the companies to whom your personal information will be disclosed are located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), in countries which do not provide the same level of protection to personal information (such as Australia and the United States).

PART 2: CREDIT REFERENCING
General Information
If you apply for a loan from us, we will perform searches with credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt.
We will ask for your consent before passing details about you to any credit reference agencies. If you no not give us your consent, we will not proceed with your application.
The information below tells you about how credit reference agencies, Cash Converters
and other lenders use your Personal Information.
What is a credit reference agency?
Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers’ and businesses’ credit behaviour, on behalf of lenders in the UK.
What is a fraud prevention agency?
Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.
Why do you use them when I have applied to you?
Although you have applied to us and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.
Where do they get information from?
Publicly available information sources such as
The Electoral Register at Local Authorities
County Court Judgments from Registry Trust
Bankruptcy information from the Insolvency Service
Fraud information from fraud prevention agencies
Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies and credit card companies
How will I know if my Personal Information is sent to a CRA or FPA?
You will be told when you apply for a loan if your data will be supplied. The next section tells you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time for the name of the CRAs and FPAs we use.
Why is my Personal Information used in this way?
We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.
Who controls what CRAs can do with my Personal Information?
All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the ICO. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.
Can just anyone see my Personal Information held at CRAs?
No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or if there is a legal requirement to do so.
Applying to us for a loan
We will search at credit reference agencies and at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and we will send the information you supply to us as part of the loan application to the credit reference agencies.
If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may also pass this information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect us, them and our respective customers from theft and fraud.
With the information we obtain from the credit reference agencies we will:
assess your application for credit
verify your identity
undertake checks for the prevention and detection of fraud and money laundering
undertake periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services
We may also use scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Any or all of these processes may be automated.
After you have a loan from us
Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give certain Personal Information about you to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies. We may make periodic searches of our records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your loan with us, to take decisions regarding your identity and also credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit.
If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover payment. To help us do this, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who assist us with tracing, debt collection and debt enforcement.
About Credit Reference Agencies
When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will place a search ‘footprint’ on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future.
The credit reference agencies will also supply us with:
credit information such as previous applications
public information such as County Court Judgments and bankruptcies
electoral register information
fraud prevention information
If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt. Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or defaulted.
How credit reference agencies use your Personal Information
The information which we, other organisations and fraud prevention agencies provide to the credit reference agencies about you may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:
make decisions on credit
trace your whereabouts and recover payment if you do not make payments you owe
conduct checks for the prevention and detection of crime including fraud and money laundering
undertake statistical analysis and system testing
Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. Your data may also be used to offer you other products.
Credit references agencies will NOT use your Personal Information to create a blacklist or to make a decision.

Fraud Prevention Agencies
We have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering.
We and other organisations may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.
Part 3 – Bank Statements
If you’re applying for a Personal Loan online, you will have the ability to share the required bank statements with us, via a 3rd party provider.
You are not required to provide us with viewing access to your bank account transaction information (Transaction History) or internet banking access details. You may still be allowed to apply for a loan with us if you do not provide us with this information. However, if you do it will help us make an informed decision about whether we can lend to you.
If you agree that we may access your Transaction History the following provisions shall apply.
Provide Accurate Information. You, agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your bank accounts (with us or third parties) and you agree to not misrepresent your identity or your account information. You agree to keep your bank account information up-to-date, accurate and complete.
Purposes. We will access your Transaction History using the services of a credit reference agency called Perfect Data Solutions Limited ( PDS ). We will use your Transaction History to assess your creditworthiness and whether the loan you seek is affordable.
Neither we nor PDS will store or have access to your internet banking credentials, PIN codes or passwords. That information is encrypted in transit and stored by a third party service provider upon their servers in a secure environment outside the EEA.
Third Party Accounts. By agreeing to allow us viewing access to your Transaction History, you authorise PDS and PDS’s service providers to access third party sites designated by you, on your behalf, to retrieve information requested by us, and to register to view bank statements over a period of up to 90 days. You agree that PDS and PDS’s service providers may, and are instructed by you as your agent and nominated representative, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to access third party internet sites, servers or documents, retrieve information, and use your information, all as described above, with the full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such activities, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person. This will include the following purposes: copying Transaction History over a 90 day period and transmitting the copied Transaction History via our servers.

You should also be aware that this service is not endorsed or sponsored by any third party bank account providers. We would recommend that you refer to the terms and conditions of your internet banking provider if you would like more information.

We cannot guarantee that allowing us to review your Transaction History will guarantee the success of your loan application or the rate at which the loan is available. The Lender shall include the following prescribed questions and answers within the Website:
1. Why do you ask for my internet-banking details?
By inputting your details we are able to view up to 90 days of bank account history. This helps us make our lending decisions, assessing whether and if so what amount of credit is affordable and sustainable for you. As a responsible lender, we work with credit reference agencies to review your creditworthiness. As part of that process it is important for us to verify your incomings and outgoings. Ultimately, this will help us ensure that you do not fall in difficulties in making the repayments due under a loan or incurring further costs and charges. We are only permitted a read­only access to your current account, so will only ever be able to view the recent transactions on your account -nothing more. Your bank details are encrypted in transit and stored securely by our credit reference agency and its services providers. We do not have the ability to change any of your banking details, set up standing orders/direct debits or to manage your account in any other way. All data is securely handled in accordance with data protection laws and our privacy policy.
2. Who sees my internet banking log-in details?
No person can access your internet banking details. When you enter your banking credentials on our website they are securely transmitted. The encrypted details are then passed by our credit reference agency, Perfect Data Solutions Limited and associated service providers. They are stored in a highly secure data centre which has a single use, which is to generate a read-only data-feed which we will use to assess the affordability of the loan.
3. What happens to my internet banking details after inputting them on your website?
As an organisation, security of data and prevention of fraud are fundamental to us. We are committed to using practices to ensure that our services are provided within a secure environment. Your internet banking details are encrypted and held securely by our professional service providers. Our credit reference agency partner, Perfect Data Solutions Limited and us, are permitted read-only access to your current account, so will only ever be able to view your account.
We do not have the ability to change any of your banking details or set up standing orders/direct debits. All data is securely handled in accordance with data protection laws and our privacy policy.
4. What happens to the bank statements you obtain?
They will be used by use to make lending decisions about you and stored by us as long as necessary to assist us in managing your account or underwriting loan to you.
5. What will my bank say about me inputting my log-in details into your website?

Your data is encrypted in transit;
We do not have any functionality over your bank account; and
We only have access to a read-only service.
Should PDS be directed specifically by Yodlee to ensure the following is actioned, The Lender shall within 60 days of having received written notice from PDS include the following prescribed data protection terms within Loan Agreements.
