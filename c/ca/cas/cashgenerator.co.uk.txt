Credit checks
If you apply for a loan from us, in order to process your application, we will need to perform something called a "credit search". This helps us to decide whether or not you are eligible to receive a loan from us. To help us to make this decision, we may need to obtain information from Credit Reference Agencies ("CRAs") and/or Fraud Prevention Agencies ("FPAs"). We may also have to pass on some of your information to the CRAs and/or FPAs that we use. This section of the Privacy Policy sets out in detail what we, CRAs and FPAs do with your information for credit check purposes and why.
By signing and submitting a loan application form, you will be agreeing to us, CRAs and FPAs sharing your information as described in this Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you read this document carefully and make sure that you understand it.
