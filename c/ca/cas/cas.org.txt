WHERE IS MY DATA STORED?
We (and many of our external third parties) are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;
by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has in the EEA;
where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
To keep this privacy policy as short and easy to understand as possible, we have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at privacy@cas.org for the details as to how we protect specific transfers of your data.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our third party data storage providers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share your password with anyone.
HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR DATA?
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or contractual requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for the personal information we hold, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the reasons why we handle your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Where we have used your personal information to contact you for marketing communications, if you have opted-in:
we will contact you periodically as we determine is reasonable and appropriate to ensure you would like to continue receiving electronic communications; or
If you tell us that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, we promise to stop sending them to you.
Where we have processed your data for any other reason (such as where you have contacted us with a question in connection with our products or services) we will retain your data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including to satisfy any legal, accounting or other similar requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research, product development, improvement or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
