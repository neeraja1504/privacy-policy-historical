When you contribute to Casetext, the content you post and metadata about that content (such as the time you posted the content) will be viewable by the public, along with your name. This information will be searchable online and may be reused or modified elsewhere. Please see our Terms—particularly the section on  Subscriber Content—for more information.
We may aggregate and display information about your publicly viewable activities on Casetext in your profile, which is also viewable by the public. For example, your profile may include a list of the tags, analysis, related materials, and other annotations that you have contributed.

When you register for an account, add profile information, or purchase any product or service from us, you give us personal information. For example, we may collect and store your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email, and postal address. If you use a social networking website (such as Google+, LinkedIn, or Facebook) to sign in, we will also collect and store your user ID for that social network.
Your name and the information you add to your profile will be viewable by the public. You can review or request changes to this information by logging into your account at www.casetext.com or by contacting us at support@casroombaetext.com.
