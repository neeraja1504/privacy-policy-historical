About Cagora
Cagora is an online service made up of a network of Local and Special Interest communities designed to make it easy to share information & network with friends, family, business and people around you. Cagora users are able to view other people's profiles, communicate and network with others, create and share information such as blogs, articles, photos, videos and reviews, and find products and services locally and around the world.
Cagora understands that our members may not want their information being readily available to other Cagora users, and we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that information.
