Privacy Policy | Center for Rural Affairs
The Center for Rural Affairs is committed to preserving your privacy and safeguarding sensitive information. The following statement describes the general information-gathering and usage practices of our site.
The Center for Rural Affairs does not sell the names or personal data that we collect on our website. Rarely, we may share names and addresses of people on our database for the exclusive, one-time, non-commercial use by another nonprofit organization whose mission is consistent with ours.
When you subscribe to the Center's newsletter, we will enter your personal information into our database in order to send you our newsletter and to keep you abreast of our future work and related issues that may be of interest to you. In September/OctoberÂ of each year we ask our donors to renew their interest in donating to us and to continue to receive the newsletter. If you do not want to receive materials from us, you can call 402.687.2100 or email us at info@cfra.org.
Basic data is gathered by our web hosting service that records date, time, IP address, and request details for all transactions that are processed by their web servers. This information is not directly linked to any specific user name or information that easily identifies the user. Data such as this is gathered by all web servers to track system performance, bandwidth utilization, and site statistics to determine the popularity of specific pages on each website. The analysis of this data helps our web hosting service anticipate growth and helps us to design our website to be more responsive to our visitors' interests.
