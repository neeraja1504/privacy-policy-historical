1. Collection of Personal Information **
Personal information is information or opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. The nature of personal information collected by CFA through our web site generally comprises an individual's name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail).

CFA collects information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information, contest entry information and/or site registrations, name and address, telephone number, fax number, payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address).
CFA also collects other types of personal information from time to time (eg. credit information), only for purposes of online catalog sales, registration fees, etc.
CFA does not collect personal information unless it is necessary for CFA to perform one or more of its functions and activities. CFA will destroy personal information when it is no longer required for such functions and activities.
CFA will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, CFA may collect personal information via telephone or letter, when you attend a function or event, request printed information or specific mailings, enter a competition, or provide a resume.

CFA may also use that personal information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes might include adding your name to a contact list, email notification or invitation list.
CFA will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent. CFA may however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is:

7. Access To Personal Information **
You may request access to the personal information CFA holds about you.

a. All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to the Executive Director.
b. You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will allow CFA to process your request faster.
c. CFA will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually be granted within 14 days, or if it is more complicated, 30 days. CFA will inform you if this timeframe is not achievable.
d. You will be asked to verify your identity.
e. A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.
f. Depending on the circumstances, you may be forwarded the information by mail or email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place.
g. You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is no longer accurate.
In some circumstances, CFA may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:

b. denying access is required or authorized by law;
c. the request is frivolous;
d. legal proceedings are underway;
e. negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or
f. access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision making process.
