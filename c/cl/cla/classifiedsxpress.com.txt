How do we use the information collected from Visitors?
The basic user information collected is used to help us analyze web traffic and to improve the content of our web site. Cookies may be used to facilitate your customer interaction with us.Â  Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes.
We may from time to time disclose to third parties aggregate information on our web site's traffic profile. For example, Internet advertising companies may require this data to help us better target our advertisements on our web site(s) and/or other web sites.
Note that our site may provide links to products and services offered by other companies; the company's web site that you link to will be able to determine that you linked from our web site.

How do we use the information collected from Customers ?
We use the contact information you provide us to establish our service for you. We use payment information for payment processing purposes only. We create and maintain other information such as customer account status, choice of services, and customer logs in the normal course of providing service.
Hagen Hosting may share customer information with selected partners/third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products which might be of interest to you or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. Hagen Hosting may also use customer information to provide customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.
We will not otherwise disclose customer personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Hagen Hosting, our customers, or others, or where Hagen Hosting has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.
Hagen Hosting also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Hagen Hosting stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which Hagen Hosting will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:
It is necessary in order to provide service to the customer;
It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Hagen Hosting and its customers;
It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that Hagen Hosting determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and
It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Hagen Hosting and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.
Hagen Hosting disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Hagen Hosting will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm Hagen Hosting, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which Hagen Hosting may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of Hagen Hosting's Terms of Service.
Customers may opt out of receiving newsletters and/or notices of new or upgraded products and services from Hagen Hosting by sending a request to privacy@hagenhosting.com. In this request, customers must identify their domain name and contact information.
Please note, however, that Hagen Hosting reserves the right to send bulletins and other important information regarding our services at our discretion.

What are the kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?
Other than authorized personnel of Hagen Hosting, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your account is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Hagen Hosting will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a communications session with our servers via FTP, Telnet, SSH, your Control Panel, or other means. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Hagen Hosting cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

How does Hagen Hosting protect children's privacy?
HagenHosting.com is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. Hagen Hosting does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, Hagen Hosting will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.
As a result of the new Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States, we are required to prohibit children under 13 who reside in the U.S. from using any of the features of our site that require them to submit information via forms. This is due to the onerous reporting and verification requirements that this new law places on web sites that allow children under 13 to submit information via forms. Since we do not have the large, dedicated staff that would be necessary to comply with these requirements, our only option in order to remain in compliance with the law is to prohibit all children under 13 who reside in the U.S. from posting any information via forms on our web site. Therefore, children under 13 who reside in the U.S. should not submit any information via forms on our web site, and if you submit such information, you warrant that you are either over the age of 13 or not located in the U.S. and thus not subject to COPPA.

What else should you know about your online privacy?

Can changes be made to this Policy?
