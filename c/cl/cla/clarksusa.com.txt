Privacy Policy Information - Clarks® Shoes Official Site
C & J Clark America, Inc. and our family of brands, which include, but are not limited to Clarks, Bostonian, Privo, and Indigo (collectively known as "Clarks"), value and respect your individual privacy. As part of our commitment to providing exceptional products and services, we collect personal information during our interactions with you. The following privacy policy outlines what information we collect, how it is handled, and the steps we take to ensure that it remains protected.
Information we collect and how we use it
Individuals using www.clarksusa.com and www.bostonianshoe.com (our "Sites") may choose to provide their personal information at various times. Providing your personal information is always voluntary. The following explains where you may provide such information and how it is used. Please note that in any instance where we use your information for email marketing purposes, you will only receive such communications if you elect to do so (see "Email Communications and Your Choices").
• | "My Account"
When you register on any of our Sites, we ask for your name, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code), phone number, and email address in order to set up your account. We also allow you the option of providing additional information, including, but not limited to, your date of birth and gender. The more we know about you, the more we are able to personalize your site experience and tailor our specific products and promotions to meet your interests.
The information we collect through the "My Account" feature is used to help improve our Sites, customize your site experience, deliver updates or notices about our organization, and to send you direct and/or email marketing communications about our products and promotions.

• | Purchases
When you make a purchase through one of our Sites, we ask for information such as your name, email address, billing address, telephone number, payment card information, and shipping address. Such information is used to process, confirm, and ship your order. We may also use this information to send you direct and/or email marketing communications about our products and promotions.
When shipping an order to a third party, you will be required to provide their name, shipping address, telephone number, and email address. Such information is used solely to complete the order and to notify the recipient of their shipment. Clarks will never use the personal information of a third party recipient for marketing purposes.
• | "Contact Us"
If you choose to communicate using the "Contact Us" feature, we will ask for your name, email address, and telephone number. We use this information to respond to your inquiry and to assist you in navigating our Sites.
• | Surveys and Contests
Clarks may, on occasion, request information from you using surveys, sweepstakes, or other like contests. Your participation is never required. If you choose to participate, we may ask for your name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number. We use this information to administer the relevant survey or contest and for award notification purposes, as applicable. Clarks may also use the information to provide you with direct and/or email marketing communications about our products and promotions.
• | Product Ratings and Reviews Users of our Sites may provide ratings and reviews about our products. To submit a review, you must first create and/or access your clarksusa.com account. Because we are able to associate you with the review you are submitting, we may use information in your review to personalize your site experience and tailor our product offerings to meet your interests.
• | Visitors When you choose to browse our Sites as a visitor, we gather only non-personally identifiable information from you, as outlined in the "Cookies and Other Web Applications" section of this policy.
Cookies and other web applications
Clarks uses cookies and other technologies for remarketing purposes and to better understand the needs and wants of our customers. Cookies are small data text files which are automatically transferred from our Sites to your computer’s hard drive for identification purposes. Cookies allow us to recognize your web browser every time you visit, so that we can personalize your experience and identify the areas of our Sites which are most relevant to you.
Clarks also uses cookies to collect aggregate data about our customer base. Through the use of cookies, we are able to track which parts of our Sites are most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. Such information helps us to provide you with improved services and a better overall site experience.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies from our Sites or any others, you can modify your browser preferences to refuse them. In order to do so, please refer to your browser’s "help" section.
In addition to using cookies, we also gather non-personally identifiable "click stream" data and store it in our website log files. "Click stream" data records your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), previously visited web pages, and domain name. We use this data solely to improve the content of our Sites and to understand the demographics of our customer base. We will not use this information to market directly to you, as our website logs do not store any personally identifiable information.
Like most websites, our Sites may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags” or “web beacons” that allow us to track the actions of users of our Sites. Pixel tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or in e-mails that tell us when you have displayed that page or opened that email. This information is used to send you marketing and other communications, including information about our products and promotions, that we think might interest you.
Criteo: Clarks utilizes Criteo cookies for remarketing and email marketing purposes. The purpose of Criteo’s service is to find visitors to Criteo’s advertising clients’ properties in order to send them personalized emails or serve personalized ads. Criteo uses cookies to single out users and personalize ads from their browsing experience. To learn more or opt out of Criteo display: http://www.criteo.com/privacy/.

Third parties and your information
Clarks does not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties without first giving you advance notice, except as set forth in this privacy policy. We may disclose your information to third parties with whom you explicitly ask us to share your information, where it is permitted or required by law, and as it is necessary for business operation purposes.
Clarks works with reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf, some of whom require access to your personal information in order to properly assist us. For example, we may use third parties to host our Sites, authorize and process credit card transactions, manage our gift card program, and administer tax calculations. When Clarks allows these third parties access to your personal information, we require that they handle your information with the utmost confidentiality and care, and use it solely for the business purpose for which it was intended. Clarks carefully selects business partners who exhibit our same high level of commitment to protecting your personal privacy.
Security
Keeping your personal information confidential and secure is important to Clarks. In order to protect the payment information you provide to us, including your credit card number, expiration date, security code, and billing address, we use 2048-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology encrypts your information so that it cannot be recognized or decoded in cyberspace.
Your computer will begin operating in secure mode once you enter our checkout page. You can confirm that SSL is active by looking in the lower left hand corner of your browser, where you will see either a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending on your browser type). Additionally, the URL line of your browser will change from "http" to "https" when the SSL technology is operating.
