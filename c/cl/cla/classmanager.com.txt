Privacy Policy
Classmanager.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our registered users. Below is our privacy guarantee and some additional information about why we gather information about our registered users and what we do with it. We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.
Additional Information
Why do we ask for personal information about you? Our goal at Classmanager.com is to provide you with a comprehensive set of information, educationally oriented resources and software tools to assist you in your profession. To achieve this goal, we need to be able to identify your account from session to session. This requires that you provide us with some individually identifiable information about yourself. Your user name, password and email address allows us to differentiate you from other users and maintain your access to the site. If you use our software, your registration information enables us to keep your records private. Other information that we ask you to share with us allows us to improve the site and still keep it free. Aggregate demographic information about our users is valuable to our advertisers because it provides them with more effective channels for reaching potential customers. Without advertising support, we could not keep the site free for your use. We will never tell our advertisers your individual preferences or your individual contact information. We will only report summary information about our registered members.
What information do we gather?
The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration. As stated earlier this information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only. We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.
Will we ever send you email?
We will only send you email to inform you of a new site or software feature. Whenever you do receive a mailing from us you will always find an easy method for unsubscribing within the contents of the email.
