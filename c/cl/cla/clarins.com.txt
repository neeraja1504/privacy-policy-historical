Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Files
An IP address is a number designated for your computer by your Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet. Generally, an IP address will change every time your computer connects to the Internet. However, with some broadband connections, it is possible that the IP address assigned to your service may be static. In some cases, when combined with other information linked to an IP address, from across the Internet or that is held by other organizations with which a user might deal, that an Internet service account holder could be identified through their IP address – particularly if it is a static address. Clarins may use your IP address to gather aggregate information respecting your use of the Site; however, we will only be able to identify you individually if we have the means of linking your IP address to you as a particular user. This usually requires access to additional information which we do not seek.
When you view our Site we, or advertising and analytics companies that we may retain, may store information on the hard drive of your computer, tablet or mobile device in the form of a "cookie" Cookies are small text files stored on your device that identify your browser/IP address – but not you as a named individual – to our computers each time you visit our Site or other sites on the web.
