Our Privacy Policy - Your Privacy is Important to Us
To provide credit card security and keep your personal information safe, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the most widely used data encryption coding systems for secure e-commerce transactions. All of your information is encrypted (scrambled) prior to being sent over the Internet to our system. To protect your information once we receive it, we place it on systems behind secure firewalls, which are communication-management computers designed to keep information safe and inaccessible to other Internet users. If your browser doesn't accept the SSL technology, transactions will not be permitted.
At the time of checkout, to confirm that your connection is secure, look for a locked padlock icon or solid key icon at the bottom of your browser window. The letters "https" (rather than "http") in front of the URL address at the time of checkout also indicate that you are using a secure server.
In addition, consumer protection laws have been established to protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. In addition, federal laws limit your liability (responsibility) to $50.00 should someone steal your credit card and charge your credit card account.
