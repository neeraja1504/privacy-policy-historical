Privacy Policy - CleverReach
1. General Privacy Policy
In the following we would like to inform you about how we process your personal data in accordance with Art. 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Data Controller
CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG is responsible for the data collection and processing explained in this policy. You can find our contact data in our imprint.
Usage data & log files
When you visit our web pages, temporary so-called usage data are stored on our web server for statistical purposes as a protocol to improve the quality of our web pages. This data set contains:
The page from which the file was requested,
The file name,
The date and time of the query,
The amount of data transferred,
The access status (file transferred, file not found),
The description of the type of web browser used,
The IP address of the requesting computer, which is shortened so that a personal reference can no longer be established.
These log data are only stored anonymously. We store this log data strictly earmarked for a maximum of seven days to be able to detect, limit, and eliminate attacks on our websites. We delete these data at the end of this period. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
2. Analysis tools and third-party tools
When you visit our website, your surfing behavior can be statistically evaluated. This is primarily done with cookies and so-called analysis programs. The analysis of your surfing behavior usually takes place anonymously – it cannot be traced back to you. You may object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Read this privacy policy for further details.
3. Cookies
We use cookies on our websites. Cookies are small data files that are placed and read on your device. There is a difference between session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and permanent cookies, which are stored beyond the individual session. Cookies may contain data that make it possible to recognize the device used. In some cases, however, cookies only contain information on certain settings that cannot be related to individuals. On our websites, we use both session and permanent cookies. The processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR and in the interest of optimizing or enabling user guidance and adapting the presentation of our website. You can set your browser so that it informs you about the placement of cookies, which makes the use of cookies transparent for you. You can also delete cookies at any time via the respective browser setting and prevent the placing of new cookies. Please note that our web pages may not be displayed properly and that some functions may no longer be technically available.
4. Google Analytics
For the demand-oriented design of our website we create pseudonymous usage profiles with Google Analytics. Google Analytics use cookies that are placed on your device and we can read them. This allows us to recognize returning visitors and count them as such. Data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR and § 15 (3) of German Telemedia Act and in the interest of finding out how often our websites have been accessed by various users.
The information a cookie generates about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, because we have activated IP anatomization on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within Member States of the European Union. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA (an appropriate level of data protection is available according to Art. 45 (1) GDPR through Google’s participation in the Privacy Shield) and only shortened there. We have concluded a contract for order processing with Google Inc. (USA) in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. Google will therefore only use all information strictly for the purpose of evaluating the use of our website for us and compiling reports on website activities. You can object to the processing at any time. Please use one of the following options:
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the respective settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
5. Facebook Pixel
Our website uses the visitor action pixel of Facebook, Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”) for conversion tracking. This way, the behavior of page visitors can be tracked after they have been forwarded to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. This allows the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements to be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and future advertising measures to be optimized. For us as the operator of this website, the collected data is anonymous; we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, Facebook stores and processes your data, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with the Facebook data use guidelines. This allows Facebook to serve ads on Facebook pages and outside of Facebook. We as the site operator cannot influence the use of data. Facebook pixels are used on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in effective advertising measures including social media.
Please see Facebook’s privacy policy for more information about your privacy:  https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You can also deactivate the marketing function “Custom Audiences” in the settings section for advertisements at https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen.You must be logged in to Facebook. If you do not have a Facebook account, you can disable Facebook usage-based advertising on the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices.
6. Retargeting Google
We use Google’s cross-device remarketing technologies to enable us to display targeted advertising on other websites based on your visit to our websites. Data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both their website and their advertising. When you visit our websites, it is possible that Google’s Cross-Device Remarketing technologies may retrieve recognition features for your browser or your end device (e.g. create a so-called browser fingerprint), evaluate your IP address or store a recognition feature in the form of a small data file on your end device (e.g. a so-called third-party cookie). It is also possible that Google may link and store your visit to our website with one or more of these recognition features in order to display our advertising on other pages on the Internet.The recognition features described above are designed as pseudonyms. Due to the cross-device remarketing technologies at Google, we can commission the placement of advertisements on other websites that are based on the visits on our websites. So, if you visit another website that is part of Google’s display advertising network, Google can use the recognition features to determine alternatives, and if so, which of our ads should be displayed to you. For more information on how Google Remarketing technologies work, visit https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.
If you sign in to Google services with your own credentials or use one or more of your own Google accounts, Google may link the recognition features of different browsers and devices. So, if Google has created a recognition feature for your laptop, desktop PC or smartphone or tablet, you can associate those features once you use or have used a Google service with your sign-in information. In this way, Google can also play our advertising campaigns beyond end devices in a targeted manner. However, Google will only do this if you have agreed to this data processing in the past. You have the option of making settings for advertising. You can object to this form of advertising at any time. To do so, please visit https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922 and deactivate personalized advertising. Please note that these settings may not affect all devices and browsers.
7. Google AdWords (as of 24 July, 2018 Ads) and Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”). In the context of Google AdWords, we use the so-called Conversion Tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a cookie is placed for conversion tracking. Cookies are small data files that the Internet browser places on a user’s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to personally identify users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and Clever Reach can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked through the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive any information that personally identifies users. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can opt out of this use by simply deactivating the Google Conversion Tracking cookie via your Internet browser under User Settings. You are then not included in the conversion tracking statistics.
The storage of “conversion cookies” and the use of this tracking tool are based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both his website and his advertising. For more information on Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, please see Google’s privacy policy: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/. You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.
8. Bing Ads
This website uses Bing Ads, a service of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA – Bing Ads Conversion Tracking. When you click on one of our ads on Bing or on selected Bing network sites, a temporary cookie is placed on your computer. When you now reach one of our conversion pages – recognizable for Microsoft Bing and us – we know that you have previously clicked on the ad. This is used to create conversion statistics, i.e. to record how many users reach a conversion page after clicking on an ad, i.e. to complete an order process. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking process, you can also reject the setting of a cookie required for this – for example using a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. The use of Bing Ads is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both their website and their advertising.
