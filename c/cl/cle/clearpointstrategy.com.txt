Personal information will be retained as long as required by a relevant law (e.g. to ensure compliance with tax requirements); if required by any relevant contractual agreement; and for as long as is required to manage engagement with you.
5. Web Site Navigational Information
Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses
ClearPoint Strategy uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information used on the Company’s Web sites and how this information may be used.
Cookies
ClearPoint Strategy uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, ClearPoint Strategy’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to ClearPoint Strategy, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.
ClearPoint Strategy uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.
**Targeting or Advertising cookies  **
From time-to-time, ClearPoint Strategy engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites. ClearPoint Strategy sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of Company advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Company’s Web sites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it.
ClearPoint Strategy also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below) on the Company’s Web sites, from emails, and on third-party Web sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Web sites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Web sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and manner in which data is stored.
Web Beacons
ClearPoint Strategy uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers’ and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, ClearPoint Strategy may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. ClearPoint Strategy uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications.
IP Addresses
When you visit ClearPoint Strategy’s Web sites, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, ClearPoint Strategy uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.  ClearPoint Strategy also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
Do Not Track
Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. ClearPoint Strategy does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Company’s Web sites, in part because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. ClearPoint Strategy takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
6. Public forums, refer a friend, and customer testimonials
ClearPoint Strategy may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. ClearPoint Strategy is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform friends about the Company’s Web sites. When using the referral program, the Company requests the friend’s name and email address. ClearPoint Strategy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Company’s Web sites. ClearPoint Strategy does not store this information.
ClearPoint Strategy posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. ClearPoint Strategy obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.
