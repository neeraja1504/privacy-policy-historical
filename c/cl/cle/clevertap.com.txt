2.Types and Uses of Collected Information. WizRocket collects two types of information:
__a. Personal Data. Personal Data is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities via the CleverTap Service and/or the CleverTap Websites, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the CleverTap Service (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information, such as name, address (including zip code), email address and/or telephone number. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity with the CleverTap Service. Depending on the Identification Activity, WizRocket may not re-ask you for Personal Data if such are already stored with us.

Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the CleverTap Service (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).
Through our [“import Customer End Users”] feature option, we may also collect information such as the name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and/or IP address of Customer End Users that you choose to share with us. When you provide us with personal information about your Customer End Users, we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided, such as to add new records to your CleverTap account, or as agreed in the applicable agreement with Customer.

Such interactions are governed by the applicable privacy policy of such social media feature.
__b. Non-Personal Data. Non-Personal Data is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the URL of the website you visited before coming to the CleverTap Websites or otherwise participating in the CleverTap Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the CleverTap Websites, the type of browser you are using, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personal Data. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit or use the CleverTap Websites through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy.

As part of the provision of the CleverTap Service to Customers, WizRocket collects certain information and data about Customer End Users as determined by the applicable Customer (“Customer End User Data”). WizRocket does not control or otherwise approve any messages or requests for Customer End User Data made by a Customer to a Customer End User. Customer End Users should be aware that a Customer can request such Customer End User Data from them in order to use the Customer’s website(s) and/or mobile application(s) and that Customer End User Data may then be included in information given to WizRocket through your use of the CleverTap Service. Therefore, Customer End Users should be prompted review the privacy policy of a Customer’s website and/or mobile application to asses the security of any information a Customer End User discloses. To the extent that WizRocket does receive any Customer End User Data, WizRocket shall make reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the confidentiality of such Customer End User Data. WizRocket has no direct relationship to the Customer End Users whose Customer End User Data it processes and such Customer End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Customer End User Data should direct his or her query to the applicable Customer for removal. Once such Customer requests removal of such applicable Customer End User Data, WizRocket will respond to such request within one month; provided that (i) such period may be extended by up to 2 additional months when necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests and (ii) Wizrocket shall inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
4. Customer End User Data. WizRocket’s Customers may electronically submit Customer End User Data. WizRocket will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer End User Data except as provided in WizRocket’s applicable agreement with Customer, or as may be required by law. WizRocket acknowledges that Customer End Users have the right to access their personal information. If personal information pertaining to a Customer End User has been submitted to us by a Customer and a Customer End User wishes to exercise any rights it may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, Customer End User should inquire with the Customer directly. Because WizRocket personnel have limited ability to access data our Customers submit to the CleverTap Service, if a Customer End User wishes to make a request directly to WizRocket, please provide the name of the Customer who submitted your data to the Clevertap Service. We will refer your request to such Customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request within one month; provided that (i) such period may be extended by up to 2 additional months when necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests and (ii) Wizrocket shall inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
