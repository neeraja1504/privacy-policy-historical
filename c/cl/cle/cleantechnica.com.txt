CleanTechnica Privacy Policy
Date Last Revised: January 25, 2018
Contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
This privacy policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of our website, emails, and mobile applications (“Site”) and how we use that information in connection with our service offered through the Site (the “Service”). The terms “we,” “us,” “CleanTechnica,” and “CleanTechnica.com” refer to CleanTechnica.
When you use the Site, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. CleanTechnica is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal identity information about our users. The information addressed in this Privacy Policy includes “Personal Information,” which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your full name, physical address or email address, telephone and fax number as well as “Non-Identifiable Information,” which is non-public information that may be associated with or linked to a specific CleanTechnica account but does not by itself permit the identification of individual persons (e.g., demographic, interest, or site usage information). This Privacy Policy does not pertain to any information that is publicly available on or through CleanTechnica.
CleanTechnica stresses its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your Personal Information. We regularly re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges.
Your Privacy is not for sale
CleanTechnica uses and discloses your Personal Information as follows:
to analyze site usage and improve the Service and Site;
to deliver to you any administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Service;
to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;
for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and
protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;
to third parties that provide services to CleanTechnica;
to enforce CleanTechnica’s Terms of Use; and
as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We limit the collection and use of your information
In general, we collect both Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information that you submit voluntarily to CleanTechnica. We collect information that you submit during the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on the Site. For example, the registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, email address, and password (collectively “Registration Information”).
We may also request Non-Identifiable Information including year of birth, gender, and other demographic information. We also collect information from content that you submit during your use of the Site, such as comments or feedback, and other information you chose to submit, including information from other social networks that you choose to link to your account.
From time to time we may request other Personal Information to provide you with other benefits of the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. CleanTechnica may make anonymous or aggregate Personal Information and disclose such data in a non-personally identifiable in combination with Non-Identifiable Information to:
Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes
Organizations approved by CleanTechnica that conduct research into consumer habits and lifestyle. Such information does not identify you individually.
Access to your Registration Information, Account Credentials, Account Information, and any other Personal Information you provide is restricted and used in accordance with internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. Employees may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending email messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your Personal Information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they’re providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
In general, both the Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information you submit to us is used to provide you access to CleanTechnica, to improve CleanTechnica, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of CleanTechnica and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers. For example, we may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through CleanTechnica or the social network from which you have connected to CleanTechnica (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).
This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of Non-Identifiable Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Non-Identifiable Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion. Specifically, we may use any of the Non-Identifiable Information you provide or that we collect from you or third parties to assist us in recommending content or connections, and we may disclose Non-Identifiable Information to third parties who assist us in delivering you more relevant advertising and content.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
