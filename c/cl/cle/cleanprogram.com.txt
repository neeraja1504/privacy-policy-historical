Clean Program | Privacy Policy
The Clean Program Corp. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Our Web sites are designed with numerous precautions to protect users? information. Customer information is appropriately protected in-house as well as online. Sensitive information (such as a credit card account number) is protected by Secure Socket Layer encryption. While on a secure page, such as an order form, the lock icon at the bottom of a webpage becomes locked, rather than open (or unlocked) as when the user is simply "surfing" the Web. In addition, access to users' information is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
