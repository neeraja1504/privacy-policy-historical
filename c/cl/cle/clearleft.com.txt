Customer Service
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and about issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone.
Sharing
Clearleft does not pass on or sell information about our customers to any other business or organisation. The only exception to this is where we are legally obliged to do so to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
Business Transitions
In the event Clearleft Ltd goes through a business transition, users will be notified via a prominent notice on our website for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used differently from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.
Contact Permissions
Users who no longer wish to receive the promotional communications that they signed up for via the Leading Design mailing list may opt-out of receiving these communications by hitting the unsubscribe button at the bottom of our most recent marketing email, replying with ‘unsubscribe’ in the subject line of the email, emailing us at info@clearleft.com, phoning +44 (0)845 838 6163, or writing to Clearleft Ltd, 68 Middle Street, Brighton, BN1 1AL, UK.
Analytics
We use Google Analytics and Adwords data in a basic, user-focused way, mainly in aggregated data reports for assessing acquisition, behaviour and conversions.
Google Analytics has a comprehensive policy on data privacy and security. This gives us control over areas including customizable cookie settings, privacy controls, data sharing settings, data deletion on account termination. We will always act to minimise data collection, processing and storage in line with our Data Culture Manifesto and Privacy Policy.
Google Analytics sets out best practices to avoid sending Personally Identifiable Information (PII) — we are satisfied that in following these we are minimising risks related to PII of persons visiting our website(s) being held by Google Analytics.
Google Analytics has, on 11th April 2018, introduced data retention controls, which allow us to control data minimisation and determine how long user and event data for our website(s) is held on GA’s servers on a lawful basis in relation to the reasonable requirements of our business. As of 8th May 2018 we have set data retention at the minimum period of 14 months for all Clearleft owned sites set up with Google Analytics.
Newsletter
We use Tiny Letter to send out our fortnightly newsletter. If you sign up for the newsletter, Tiny Letter's parent company—Mailchimp—will process your data. You can read their comprehensive privacy policy.
If you sign up to the newsletter, we will only ever use your email address to send you the newsletter—never for any other purpose. We will not share your email address with any third party. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time—an unsubscribe link is included at the bottom of each newsletter. You can also make a request to find out what data we are storing, namely:
your email address, and
the date you signed up for the newsletter.
That's it.
