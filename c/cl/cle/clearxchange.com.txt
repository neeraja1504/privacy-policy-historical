1. What information does CXC collect, and what does CXC do with it?
Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our Website. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our Website, but certain features may not be available to you if you disable or delete cookies created during your visits. You may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser. CXC also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested. We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:
keeping count of return visits to our Website;
accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information regarding our Website and usage of the Website for CXC’s own use and summary distribution to third parties;
determining which pages you use most;
providing content targeted to your interests and usage of our Website;
We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. In many cases, your submission will include personally identifiable information. We may use this personally identifiable information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:
contacting you about a question or feedback that you have submitted through the Website;
contacting you about potential business opportunities if you have expressed an interest in such opportunities;
contacting you regarding sales and marketing activities; and
communicating with you regarding changes or enhancements to our policies and services or issues regarding your account.
2. Will CXC share my information?
CXC will not share your personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or marketing organization without first receiving your consent, unless (a) we are working with other companies to provide you with information or services that you have requested, (b) CXC reasonably believes that your personally identifiable information should be shared to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or (c) your actions violate the law, our Website’s Terms of Use, or threaten the rights or safety of CXC or any person. If you use the services of one of CXC’s affiliates, you grant us permission to send your personally identifiable information to that affiliate. Our affiliates’ use of such information is governed by their respective privacy policies. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information with anyone for any legal purpose, including but not limited to sharing it with advertisers, investors, and in the course of making presentations. If CXC is acquired by or merged with another company, CXC may transfer personally identifiable information about you to the acquiring company.

CXC uses commercially reasonable security measures to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your user data under our control.

Indeed, as you probably know, despite our use of industry standard security technologies, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

Please note that, at all times, you are responsible for updating your personal information to provide us your current email address. If the last email address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.
