Personal Information
The term “Personal Information”, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify or relates to an identifiable person. Personal information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person. Personal Information we collect may include:

Cookies, Web Server Logs and Other Technologies
Similar to many commercial websites, we utilize “cookies” and other technologies to collect information in connection with our Site. “Cookies” are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies store information accessed through your browser to streamline activities and make the online experience easier and more personalized. Information gathered through cookies and web-server log files may include information such as the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, IP addresses, links to/from any page, and time spent at a site. We use cookie data to measure web traffic and usage activity on our Site for purposes of improving and enhancing the functionality of our Site, to look for possible fraudulent activity, and to better understand the sources of traffic and transactions on our Site. Cookies also allow our servers to remember your account information for future visits and to provide personalized and streamlined information across related pages on our Site. In order to understand and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, we may also use web beacons, cookies, and other technology to identify the fact that you have visited our Site or seen one of our advertisements. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also consider visiting aboutcookies.org, which provides helpful information about cookies. You can choose to disable cookies for our Site but this may limit your ability to use our Site and Services.
We may use third party advertising networks to serve advertisements that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Site and other websites, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Site and other websites, on any of your devices. To do so, these networks may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through use of web beacons or pixel tags). They may use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop, and to make decisions about the advertisements you see based on it. If you would like more information about this practice and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/.
Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, language, and browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that the Site functions properly.
Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You may also download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add on, available here.
