By accessing and using the Website and/or communicating with us in respect of our services you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
The Information We Collect
We collect personally identifiable information relating to you (including name, address, phone number and e-mail address) ( “Personal Information” ) in the following situations:
Information you provide: when you enter into agreements with us or enquire in relation to the services which we offer and/or purchase our services or otherwise contact us to obtain information relating to us or our services.
Information collected automatically using cookies: whenever you interact with the Website, we receive and store certain types of information using “cookies”. We describe how we use cookies below.
Information from other sources: we receive information from third parties in the course of providing services to you from time to time (including in the processing of payments.)
The Data and Information you Upload to CloudSigma Services
Users of CloudSigma services can upload and transmit data to virtual drives ( “Virtual Drive Data” ) for storage and usage in relation to our services. All Virtual Drive Data uploaded to CloudSigma is stored securely on our servers in our dedicated rack space in Switzerland. All Virtual Drive Data is stored encrypted using a 256bit AES-TLX encryption cascade.
Unless you give CloudSigma explicit permission, we will never inspect your stored data and will only measure the volume of your transmitted data for billing purposes or inspect your transmitted data to investigate suspected violations of our Acceptable Use Policy. We will never disclose your data to any third party unless we are required to do so by court or administrative order (see below).
How We Normally Use Information About You
We will only use your Personal Information for the purpose(s) for which you provide it to us including for example to:
respond to your enquiries and provide you with updates relating to our services;
process requests for services and supply those services to you;
process payments;
communicate with you about cloud computing and our services (including) promotional offers;
update our records and maintain any account information you may have with us;
prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our Website; and
enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.
We only share your Personal Information with our associate offices and appointed agents and sub-contractors from time to time where appropriate and with other entities only as described below.
We ensure the parties with whom we share your Personal Information follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy:
Associates, Agents and Subcontractors: from time to time we request other companies to perform functions on our behalf including processing documentation, sending customer communications, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Updates and Promotional offers: if you have consented in advance we send you updates and information on our promotional offers. If you no longer want to receive such offers, please notify us at info@cloudsigma.com.
Business transfers: in any transactions (e.g. buying or selling of companies or business units) Personal Information generally is one of the transferred assets.

With your consent: other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share your information.
Virtual Drive Data is never shared with associate offices, appointed agents, sub-contractors or other entities and third parties for any reason whatsoever. All data on virtual drives remains on servers wholly owned and controlled by CloudSigma within the legal jurisdiction of Switzerland.
If you are resident in the European Union please note that the Personal Information and Virtual Drive Data you provide to CloudSigma are stored in Switzerland. The data protection laws of Switzerland differ from those of the European Union and you expressly agree to such a transfer for the purpose of us providing you with the information and services you request.
