IV. Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies
We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Site to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you
when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users
interact with advertising on our Site and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We
describe some of these technologies below.
1. Cookies. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are sent to your browser and stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device when you visit a website. The cookies send information back to the originating website or another website that recognizes that cookie. We use cookies for purposes such as improving the functionality of our website, to understand site usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our Site, save your password in password-protected areas, or save settings you may have made on the Site. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising. Advertising cookies may be placed by third parties such as advertisers, ad platforms and their agents, and can be permanent or temporary cookies. In short, they are related to advertising services provided by third parties on our website.
For visitors generating from the EU and EEA, advertising cookies are automatically not used for personalization and all advertising on the site will be generic and non-targeted. For more information on cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy.
2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for instance, third-party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners’uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.
For visitors generating from the EU and EEA, advertising cookies are
automatically not used for personalization and all advertising on the site will
be generic and non-targeted.
3. Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may
be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or
to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your
web browser, some features of the Site may be inoperable.
We may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other
than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect
and record information about your web surfing activity, including those
integrated with our Site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not
permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings
that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. To
learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of
advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA’s opt-out
program, please go to https://www.aboutads.info.
4. Web Beacons. We and our Partners may also use “web beacons” or clear GIFs,
or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on the Site or
in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors
viewing the Site or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count
the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a
visitor viewing the Site. Web beacons may also be used to provide
information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates,
clicks, forwards, etc.).
By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge,
and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of
the Site through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies
developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the
emails we send to you.
Our unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own
tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to
information about you and your online activities over time and across different
websites or applications when you use the Site. Their use of such tracking
technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies.
V. Your Ad Choices
Advertising enables us to provide the content on the Site and to provide much of
this content free of cost to our Users. Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that
are relevant to you and for products you may want.
However, you can find more information about entities involved in online
advertising and to know your choices you may make through the Network
Advertising Initiative (https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and the Digital
Advertising Alliance (https://optout.aboutads.info).
The tools provided on the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising
Alliance opt-out pages are provided by third parties, not the Site. The Site does not
control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide
through these tools.
VI. Other Important Information About Your Privacy
1. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. At this time the Site does not
recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which
may include “do not track” instructions.
2. Linked Services. The site may contain links to or integrations with other
services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services and
platforms whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors
should consult these other services’ privacy notices as we have no control
over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
3. International Transfer. This Site is governed by and operated in accordance
with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you use this Site at your own
risk. We operate globally so it is necessary to transfer your Information
internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and
processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate.
By using this Site, you (a) acknowledge that the data protection and other
laws of other countries, such as the United States, may provide a less
comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your
country, and consent to your Information being collected, processed and
transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.
4. Data Security. There are physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and
to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary
based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized
disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never
be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
Privacy Policy.
5. How You Can Access or Correct Information. Access to certain personal
Information that is collected from the Site and that we maintain may be
available to you. For example, if you created a password-protected account
within our Site, you can access that account to review the Information you
