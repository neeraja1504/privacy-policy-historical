EU GDPR compliance
What is the GDPR?
The GDPR is a European Union regulation that establishes a new framework for handling and protecting the personal data of EU-based residents. It comes into effect on May 25, 2018.
Personal data plays a huge part in society and the economy. It is essential that people have—and know they have—control and clarity over how their data is used and protected by any organization they interact with, and that organizations are given clear guidelines to protect their personal data.
One of the aims of the GDPR is to harmonize and bring data privacy laws across Europe up to speed with the rapid technological change in the past two decades. It builds upon the current legal framework in the European Union, including the EU Data Protection Directive in existence since 1995.
GDPR: How does cloudHQ comply with the GDPR?
The GDPR is consistent with how we think and operate. Our security and privacy policy was already much stronger then any GDPR requirements.
cloudHQ already meet the requirements of the GDPR. GDPR places an increased focus on documenting decisions and practices affecting personal data: and we consider protecting and locking your personal data very importat. No personal data will even be used, moved, or transferred outside very strict requirements to provide the Service.
However you should also be working to assess your readiness for the GDPR well in advance of 25 May 2018 which is GDPR enforcement day.
Trust is the foundation of our relationship with our customers. We value the confidence you’ve put in us and take the responsibility of protecting your information seriously.
​​ We place the utmost importance on data protection and we have a track record of staying ahead of the compliance curve.
Our team have carefully analyzed the GDPR and already undertakook the necessary steps to ensure that we comply.
cloudHQ includes strong contractual commitments in its agreements with our business customers. Our business customer agreements incorporate the EU model contract clauses and we are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. This means there are additional legal protections and external monitoring regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States.
Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
Model Contract Clauses for Business Users
In addition to providing full GDPR compliances, cloudHQ offers a data-processing amendment and model contract clauses as an additional means of meeting the adequacy and security requirements of the European Parliament and Council of the European Union Data Protection Directive. This agreement can be accepted and reviewed after purchasing cloudHQ Business Plan on your account page. To review and accept this amendment, you must be signed as admin of cloudHQ domain.
