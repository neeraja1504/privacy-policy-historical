This Privacy Policy applies to information (including, personal information) collected through the Site. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site, or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes.

We do not send spam, maintain spam mailing lists or support the activities of spammers.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON THE SITE AND HOW WE COLLECT  IT
Active Collection of Information
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site, purchase products or use any of the services offered via the Site. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number and payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address) when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or purchase services from the Site. Regarding credit card information, CloudBees uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use this information except to process your credit card information for CloudBees.

Passive Collection of Information
When you visit the Site, some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit including ours. Such information includes your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about your computer’s operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Site.
Cookies
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience on the Site. We use cookies to see which areas and features of the Site are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site.
Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as gifs, are electronic images that may be used on the Site or in our emails. A Web beacon may be used on our Web pages to collect information, deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness and in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
STORAGE OF INFORMATION & TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD
Most of the information we collect is retained by us on our servers. If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently the United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.

WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL  INFORMATION
Personal information collected through the Site may be shared with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf; for example, companies that provide data management or other support services to us, such as data storage and Web hosting services.
Also, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable law (or a court order or subpoena); (ii) prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) enforce the Terms of Service or other agreements that govern your use of the Site and/or our services; (iv) to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others; or (v) to protect your vital interests.

Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
