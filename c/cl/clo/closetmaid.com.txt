Security
We maintain commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect your Personal Information, including assuring that third-party service providers who access or handle Personal Information on our behalf and affiliates maintain such safeguards. We seek to encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our site using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.
However, no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error-free, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by email ClosetMaidChatTeam@emerson.com or by calling us at 1- 800-874-0008.
Cookies
We use "cookies," a small text file transferred to your device, along with similar technologies (e.g., internet tag technologies, web beacons and embedded scripts) to help provide you a better, more personalized user experience. These technologies are used to:
Make the user experience more efficient (e.g., maintaining items in your Shopping Cart between visits).
Remember your preferences (e.g., browsing language, account login information)
Help us understand and improve how visitors use our site, including which of our pages and products are viewed most frequently.
The Options/Settings section of most internet browsers will tell you how to manage the cookies and other technologies that may be transferred to your device, including how to disable such technologies. You can disable our cookies or all cookies through your browser settings, but please note that disabling cookies may impact some of the site’s features.
We also allow third parties to place cookies on your device through the Services to:
Help us understand and improve how visitors use our site, including which of our pages and products are viewed most frequently.
More effectively market our products and services and advertise other products and services that may be of interest to you.
Obtain your feedback on our products and the Services.
Allow you to engage in our social media offerings (e.g., clicking the "Like" button on our site).
You may visit the following links from our third-party partners to opt-out of their tracking and learn about their privacy practices:
Web Trends

Google Analytics
To opt-out, please download and install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Although not all cookies and similar technologies that we use are required for you to use the Services, disabling these technologies altogether could prevent the Services from working properly and disable features that allow you to take full advantage of the Services we offer.
Interest-Based Ads
Unaffiliated third parties may use cookies and other technologies on our site to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites you visit in order to provide you with interest-based advertising. You can generally opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements from members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting their opt-out pages: (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). When you opt-out using these links, please note that you may still receive advertisements. They just will not be personalized based on your interests.
Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the "Do Not Track" signal, our site does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives "Do Not Track" signals. However, we do provide choices about what Emerson ads you receive through the opt-out links in the Cookies section above.
