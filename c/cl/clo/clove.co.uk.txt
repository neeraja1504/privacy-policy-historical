IP ADDRESSES
We may collect information about your computer, including where relevant your IP address, operating system and browser type. This data is processed for the purposes of fraud prevention, for various administrative purposes and may also be used by us to promote certain offers and advertisements according to your general location.
COOKIES
For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer.
Cookies are text files which contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service.
Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate, whereas others are aimed at enhancing and personalising your user experience.
The information gathered by cookies on our site(s) may be used in the following ways:
To tailor advertisements or promotions you receive. For example, if you have looked at a specific type of mobile handset, we might use this information to personalise any subsequent advertisements you see.
We may also personalise our service based on the type of computer system you use, together with the purchase pattern of other customers who may have looked at similar products to you.
We may also provide you with advertisements which may be customised using information such as the search terms you use on our site. For example, if you searched for a specific product or accessed our site via a specific banner ad or search word, we may present you with content and/or offers linked to that banner ad or search word.
We may use navigational information about where you go on our site to better understand how our site is used and to ensure that the product offerings that are presented to you are relevant.
We do not use any data about where you go or present you with advertisements outside of our site other than on sites which provide for such use in their respective privacy policies.
We may collect information on how frequently you visit the site and the type of products and/or services that you view to enable us to measure the popularity of our sites and our product offerings.
TYPES OF COOKIE
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website, remembering how far you are through the checkout procedure, making sure that the clove.co.uk website looks consistent or remembering what's in your basket.
Without these cookies, many of the basic functionalities of our website - the stuff you expect the site to enable you to do like filling in your shopping basket - we simply can't provide.
Tip - these cookies make the basic functions of the website work.
Performance Cookies
These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and the pages that they don't visit.
This understanding enables Clove Technology to continually improve the experience we deliver to you (and other visitors like you) so that the site is easy to use and includes content that you find helpful (for instance, performance cookies indicated that users find reviews really helpful and so that gave us confidence that we should provide more reviews on each smartphone product page).
These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor - so we can't identify you individually. All the information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. This information is only used to improve how the Clove Technology website works.
Tip - these cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow the website to remember the choices you make as you browse the site (for instance, your login details to enable you to checkout faster). They provide more enhanced and personal features.
The information they collect is anonymised and the usage only relates to www.clove.co.uk - they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites once you have departed www.clove.co.uk
Tip - these cookies remember choices you have made to improve your website experience on www.clove.co.uk
Advertising or Targeting Cookies
These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you, and your interests (assumed by analysing your onsite browsing behaviour). They can also provide caps on the number of times you might see an advert - to hopefully stop them becoming annoying and repetitive.
These cookies remember that you have visited www.clove.co.uk, track what products you may have looked at, and this information may be shared with our advertising partners.
If you see an advert from Clove Technology once you have left our site and are browsing other sites on the internet, that magically seems to understand what previously interested you (you browsed a specific smartphone handset and then see deals for that handset) then this is enabled by targeting cookies.
Tip - these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant for you.
By using this site, you agree to our use of cookies in the manner outlined above. If you do not wish to receive tailored advertising, you can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your browser settings to reject specific cookies.
Please note:  it is not a good idea to reject  all  cookies as this could prevent you from gaining full use of this and other sites. To learn more about cookies click here (www.allaboutcookies.org), or to disable certain types of tracking cookies click here (info.evidon.com).

Here we will ensure that we have the necessary contracts and other mechanisms in place to make sure your data continues to be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

INTEGRATION OF THE TRUSTED SHOPS TRUSTBADGE
Following an order, the Trusted Shops Trustbadge is incorporated into this web page in order to display our Trusted Shops trustmark for buyers and the eventually collected reviews, as well as the Trusted Shops product offer.
In balancing the various interests, this serves to safeguard our legitimate prevailing interests in an optimised marketing of our offer. The Trustbadge and the services advertised are an offer of Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Köln.
Whenever a Trustbadge is called up, the web server automatically stores a so-called server log file which contains, for example, your IP address, the date and time of retrieval, the data volume transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the retrieval. This access data will not be evaluated and will be automatically overwritten seven days after your visit to the page.
Other personal information will only be transferred to Trusted Shops if you decide, after completing an order, to use Trusted Shops products or have already registered for their use. In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.
