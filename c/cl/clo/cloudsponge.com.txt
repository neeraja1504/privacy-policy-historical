Cloud Copy receives your information when you use our service known commercially as “CloudSponge,” including our various websites, APIs, widgets, email notifications, integrations, and applications (the “ Services ”) and from our partners and other third parties. By visiting the CloudSponge website, visiting a CloudSponge client website that provides notice of its use of the CloudSponge and/or this policy, or registering for our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Please contact for details.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@cloudsponge.com.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:
1. Information You Provide:
Account Information. You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must register in order to access most of the features of the Service. We ask for certain information such as your company name, your name, email address, and password when you create an account on the Service.
Additional User Content. After you setup your account, you may choose to provide additional information such as the names and email addresses of additional members of your team or an additional phone number. You may also test the Service by uploading your own team members’ name and email address to your account from your address book using the Service. Providing this information is optional.
Communications. At times, you may choose to send us messages. We may retain any messages you send to us. You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our engineering, sales, or support teams about a question regarding the Services, or post a question or comment in our public forums.
Payment and Billing Information. We also collect credit card or payment information for paid subscriptions. This information will be securely stored with a third party specialized in the handling of such information, such as a credit card payment gateway or other payment vendors.
Telephone Information. If we telephone you, or you telephone us, to discuss our Services, we may collect personal information from you, including your name, company name, business address, phone number, job title, email address, whether you use the Services, information about your business needs, the number of users of our Services you require, and, if you telephoned us, how you heard about us, and any other information you choose to share with us by telephone.
2. Information We Collect Automatically:
Device Information. Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your account on the Services.
Usage Information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like viewing reports and configuring the service). We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect our Users.
Location Information. We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
Cookies and Similar Technologies . We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that may uniquely identify your browser that lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Services. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Services, and other actions you take on the Services), and allow us to track your usage of the Services over time. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. Similarly, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track your usage patterns on the Services, or place clear gifs in HTML-based emails we send you to track which emails are opened and which links you click. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.
3. Information We Receive from Other Sources:
Authentication Services. We allow End Users with certain third-party accounts to authenticate on the Services using those third-party accounts. We support the OAuth standard and will use the OAuth standard to facilitate End Users’ use of the Services to upload their data from their respective contact management provider whenever possible. Use of the Service with respect to third-party contact management providers that support the OAuth standard does not require Cloud Copy to have access to, and Cloud Copy will not in fact have access to, your End Users’ passwords in such instances. Cloud Copy may request End Users’ credentials for certain third party contact management providers in order to complete the upload of their address book information from any source that does not support the OAuth standard. When we request this information from a third party contact management service or use the OAuth standard to facilitate authentication with a third party contact management service, we receive certain End User Content, namely registration or basic profile information from that third party service and other information that your End Users may authorize. This information enables us to authenticate the End User on that third party service and improve the Services. The information we receive depends on which contact management services the End User authorizes and any options that are available. End Users should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Services.
Third Party Analytics Services. We may also receive information from third party services to help us better understand you and how you use our Services.
End Users. We also process information about our End Users, on behalf of our Users and in accordance with our user agreements. Typically, the information we receive from an End User may include the End User’s address books information, namely contact lists, contact notes, and any images associated with an End User’s address book. For clarity, Cloud Copy only collects the minimum amount of personal data necessary for it to perform its obligations under its Terms of Service with its respective User Accordingly, any personal data about an End User is only stored in the random access memory of Cloud Copy’s servers and never written to a physical disc. The pseudoanonymous data about an End User that remains with Cloud Copy, is limited to a hash of each End User’s email address, the End User’s IP address, the source of the address book, and the number of contacts in the address book.
4. Information Collected by Third Parties:
As noted above, sometimes we receive information about you and/or your End Users from third party analytics service providers, such as Google, Sentry, Papertrail, we may also receive additional information about you from Kissmetrics, ChartMogul, CrazyEgg, Inspectlet and other third party service providers. In order to gain useful insights, these analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain features, and deliver features or content that may be more targeted to your needs. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Cloud Copy and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers. We cannot be responsible for how these third party cookies are used, and you should consult the privacy policies of these third parties for more information about how they use cookies.

For our own internal benchmarking, for example, to measure, and gauge the effectiveness of the Services, our advertising of the Services, and to better understand user retention and attrition–for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;

To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Cloud Copy and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on what we’re up to and our products. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services.
