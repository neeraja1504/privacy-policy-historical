4. How do we use cookies and other technical information?
Cookies and Web beacons. We, and our affiliates, business partners, and third­party service providers may send “cookies” to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website. “Cookies” are a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us or other networks or websites. Cookies can either be persistent—that is, they remain on your computer until you delete them—or temporary—that is, they last only until you close your browser.
When you login to our Website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you told us that you would like your password saved for automatic login. For security purposes, we encrypt account­related data that we store in these cookies. For services that do not require a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device, mainly for security protection purposes, such as to prevent phishers, scammers, unauthorized login attempts, and to help you access your hacked account. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies from our Website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our Website, content, and advertising.
Our Website may also use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe’s Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s​ website.
We may also use “Web beacons” that monitor your use of our Website. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use Web beacons to collect the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3) the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. In addition, when corresponding with you through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. But if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
Managing cookies and Web beacons. By accepting this privacy policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described in this privacy policy. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (for more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, or restrict the categories of cookies you wish to accept, you can consult the information at www.allaboutcookies.org/manage­cookies/.) Please understand that certain areas of our Website can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Website features. You assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality because of disabling cookies or similar devices.
5. How do you opt­out?
Marketing communications. We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences about receiving certain marketing communications from us or from unaffiliated third parties. If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, (1) you may log into your account if you have created an account with us to adjust your settings, (2) you may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us, or (3) you may send us an email at help@cliphunter.com and we will edit your preferences accordingly. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us but no longer want to receive them, you can manage your preferences either through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. Online opt­out requests are instant. However, we may continue to send you transactional emails, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt­out of receive them.
Mobile applications. If you no longer want to have the application collect information, you may uninstall the application by using the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or through the mobile application marketplace or network. If you no longer want to receive tailored in­application advertisements, each operating system—Android for Android devices, iOS for Apple devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices — provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in­application advertisements. You should review the support materials or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt­out of tailored in­application advertisements. For any other devices or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. Please note that the effect of opting out of targeted advertising (mobile or otherwise) will be to prevent targeted advertising, but not to prevent you from seeing all advertisements, and information may still be collected for other purposes (such as research, online services analytics, or internal operations).
6. Do you have any choices about what information you provide?
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website because that information may be required in order for you to register; purchase products or services; participate in a live interaction or promotion; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.
7. How secure is your personal information?
We take commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personally identifiable information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.
Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made 100% secure as recent cyber security breaches demonstrate. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personally identifiable information that we collect will never be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third­party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
8. What about other websites linked to our Website?
Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy concerning personally identifiable information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control the third­party websites accessible through our Website. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers. Before visiting a third party website, whether by means of a link on this Website or otherwise, and before providing any personally identifiable information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies any practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.
9. What is “Do Not Track” and does the Website follow it?
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt­out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
10. Do California residents have special privacy rights?
If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive (1) information identifying any third­party company to whom we may have disclosed, within the past calendar year, personal information concerning you and your family for our direct marketing purposes; and (2) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. If you want to exercise this right, you must make a request in writing to us to obtain this information. We will not process your request unless it includes your full name, email address, postal address, the URL for the website you visited, and the subject lined labeled “Your California Privacy Rights.” Please email your request to help@cliphunter.com. We will only honor one request per calendar year.
11. How do you update or correct your information?
To access the personally identifiable information that our Website collected about you, to correct factual errors in this information, or to update your information, please login to your account if you have created one with us or send an email to help@cliphunter.com. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take commercially reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

12.Can we change this privacy policy?
We may amend this privacy policy, as we believe necessary or convenient to operate our Website. If we do make a change, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the amended privacy policy on our Website at least 15 days before its effective date or by sending you an email message. Each version of this privacy policy will identify when we last amended it at the top of the webpage and we will keep prior versions of this privacy policy in an archive for your review (or we will otherwise maintain a copy offline and we will send it to you on request). Unless we obtain your express consent, the amended privacy policy will apply only to information collected after its effective date, and not to information collected under earlier privacy policies. We encourage you to check this webpage frequently for any changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to our amended privacy policy, please stop using this Website and delete any account you created with us. If we do not hear from you, your continued access to our Website after the amended privacy policy’s effective date will be deemed by us as your acceptance of the amended privacy policy, and thus the amended privacy policy will govern your access to or use of the Website after the effective date.
13. What law and language govern this privacy policy?
Seychelles law governs this privacy policy and any dispute related to it without regard for any choice­of­law rules that might direct the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
We have drafted this privacy policy in the English language. If a conflict exists between this English language version and any translated version of this privacy policy, the English version will prevail.
