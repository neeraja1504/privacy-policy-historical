Web browser cookies
a) What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (all referred to here as a “device”) web browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your web browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Similar technologies are also often used within emails to understand whether the email has been read or if any links have been clicked. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on Clipcanvas websites. However, you can change your cookie setting at any time.
On Clipcanvas websites, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests.
During the course of any visit to a Clipcanvas website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
b) How does Clipcanvas use cookies?
Information supplied by cookies can help us to understand the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. It also helps us recognize when you are signed in to your Clipcanvas account and to provide a more personalized experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second and subsequent visits. Clipcanvas uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. Certain areas of Clipcanvas websites may use cookies for a specific reason.
c) Third party cookies in embedded content on Clipcanvas pages
Please note that during your visits to Clipcanvas websites you may notice some cookies that are not related to Clipcanvas.

Clipcanvas does not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party’s website for more information. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on Clipcanvas website. However, you can find out about changing your cookie settings here…
Where Clipcanvas embeds content from social media and other third party websites, some websites may use Google Analytics to collect data about user behaviour for their own purposes.

Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests.
Apps and Devices
When you download or use Clipcanvas apps on your mobile device, information may be accessed from or stored to your device. Most often this is used in a similar way to a web browser cookie, such as by enabling the app to ‘remember’ you or provide you with the content you have requested.
Your web browser or device may also provide Clipcanvas with information about your device, such as a device identifier or IP address. Device identifiers may be collected automatically, such as the device ID, IP address, MAC address, IMEI number and app ID (a unique identifier relating to the particular copy of the app you are running).
If you have any concerns about the information which might be accessed from or stored on your device by Clipcanvas, you may wish to only access Clipcanvas content through a web browser and review your web browser settings.

The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use Clipcanvas websites to submit personal information to Clipcanvas.
