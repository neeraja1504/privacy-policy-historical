Customer Information
Online privacy concerns focus on the use and protection of customer information which a customer reasonably expects to be kept private. "Customer information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, email address, financial information and information about online activities that are directly linked to the Customer. As is common practice, we collect customer information, such as name, address, telephone number, credit card information and a variety of other information in the course of providing products and services to a customer and billing a customer.
