Public Profiling: So that we can tailor our communications with you in accordance with your background and interests we may collect information about you from publicly available sources or through third party subscription services or service providers.
TPYES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY
Personal Information – When we talk about your personal information we mean information about you, as an individual, that can directly or indirectly identify you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and financial details. Further details of this definition can be found under Art. 4 of the GDPR.
We collect personal information from you when you make a donation, register for an event, become a member of one of our campaigns, become one of our funders, in a contractual relationship with us, have a pre-existing relationship with us or are invited and attend our events.…. We may also ask for some additional, non-personal information.

ACCURACY AND RELEVANCE
We will ensure that any personal information we process is accurate, relevant, not excessive and used for the purpose for which it was obtained. We will not process personal data obtained for one purpose for any unconnected purpose, unless you have provided consent.
LAWFUL, FAIR AND TRANSPARENT
To ensure that the processing of your information is lawful, fair and transparent, we shall maintain a Register of Activities and this shall be reviewed annually.
You, as an individual, have the right to access your personal data and any such request made to us shall be dealt with in a timely manner.
LEGAL BASIS
We will only use your personal information where we have your consent or because we need to use it to fulfil a contractual relationship with you (for example, because we have a Grant Agreement, Sub-Grant Agreement or Service Agreement with you).
However, there are other lawful reasons that allow us to process your personal information and one of those is called “legitimate interest”.  This means that the reason we are processing your information is because there is a legitimate interest for us to do so.  When processing your personal information under “legitimate interest” we will make sure that we consider your rights and interests and will not process your personal information if we think there is an imbalance.
The legal basis for processing your personal information shall be recorded in our Register of Activities and where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing your personal information, evidence of the opt-in consent shall be kept with that personal information.
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
We will never sell or share your personal information with third parties nor will we sell any information about your web browsing activity. We may, however, share your information with our trusted partners and suppliers who work with us, as part of our legal obligation with them. We make sure that they store such data securely, delete it when they no longer need it, never use it for any other purpose and comply with Data Protection Laws, ensuring they have appropriate controls in place to ensure security of your personal information.
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice or in response to a valid request from a competent authority or, in order to enforce our conditions of sale and other agreements.
SECURITY

When your personal data is deleted, it shall be done safely so that the data is irrecoverable and we shall implement appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions.
Your data may be processed by members of our staff operating outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  We will take all steps to reasonably ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Further, all of our staff shall participate in annual internal training so that they know how to process your data in accordance with the GDPR.
