Our world is constantly changing and as such, so does this Privacy Policy.

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes within the Privacy Policy itself, on the homepage, or in other appropriate locales. Although changes are rare, it is your responsibility as the user to stay abreast of changes we have made and posted.
As a site that is designed to assist and aid you, the user, in the college process, it is completely up to you what information you disclose to us. If you choose not to provide necessary information, we may not be able to fully serve your needs but under no circumstances do we force information to be submitted.

College is not cheap, and in an attempt to ease that blow, we offer a variety of tools and services which provide access to current information on college costs. These include scholarship lists, financial aid assistance, education loan paperwork, and government agencies that might be able to help. We typically collect the following information when these tools are used: first and last name, address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, anticipated graduation date, family information, and social security number (optional). For more specific items like scholarships and financial aid forms, additional fields specific to the request might also be needed.
We pride ourselves in our secure transmission of information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your information, we take all necessary precautions to ensure its security on our systems and do so by immediately encrypting the information stored. When sensitive information such as credit card or social security numbers are transmitted, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
