ClickReport is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ClickReport collects information from our users when they register for this service.
REGISTRATION
In order to register for ClickReport service, a user must first complete a short registration form. During this process a user is required to give personal details such as their full name, phone number, email, credit card, and address details. This information is used to validate the authenticity of the user registering for the service. Credit Card Numbers are collected from our users to charge them for our services.
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we at ClickReport are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
