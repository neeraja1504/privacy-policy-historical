We will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Law and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/79.
Personal data include all information that may refer to natural or legal persons, for example first and last names, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. Simple navigation and consultation of the website do not generally involve the gathering of the User’s personal data and only relate to the processing in anonymous form of so-called navigation data. In compliance with the provisions of the Organic Law 15/1999 (Protection of Personal Information), we inform the User that the personal data communicated and gathered in the context of the registration process are held and processed by Clickpoint for the purposes listed below.
The User’s data are gathered and processed for the following:
a) carrying out reporting activities with the client based on contractual agreements subscribed with Clickpoint
b) administrative purposes and performing obligations under the law, for example, accounting, tax, or adhering to court orders;
c) Having received specific consent, sending newsletters and marketing materials via email, periodically;
d) Having received specific consent, receiving updates on our activities and new postings on our blog;
e) Having received specific consent, receiving promotional notices on event invites, training, webinars, special promotions or participating in market research and analysis;
f) In the case of curriculum vitae, exclusively for the selection process.
The legal ground for processing data is to render the site’s features functional following the user’s access or the execution of a contract to which the data subject is a party or the execution of precontractual measures adopted upon requests of the same. In the cases expressly stated, the legal ground for processing data is the consent freely given by the data subject.
Processing for the aforementioned purposes occurs manually or electronically, depending on the purposes for which the data are communicated. The User must provide personal data which are true and accurate and up-to-date for purposes of creating and managing the contractual relationship with Clickpoint and of utilising the Service.
The data shall be stored for a term that is strictly necessary for the management of the purposes for which the data was collected, in compliance with the law in force and the legal obligations. In any case, Clickpoint has enacted practices that prohibit the storage of data for an indeterminate term and therefore limits the storage term in compliance with the principle of minimising data processing.
The data-gathering will also be with a view to transferring the data in question to associated companies, subsidiaries, or companies carrying out functions closely connected with and instrumental to the Service.
The data collected, if necessary or fundamental to execute the indicated purposes, may be used by external third-party Processors, or depending on the case, disclosed to the same independent controllers and more specifically: The companies belonging to our corporate group, Individuals, companies, associations or groups of professionals that provide assistance and advice to our Company, entities or associations that provide services connected and instrumental to carrying out the above-mentioned purposes.
The data collected may also be transferred abroad, to companies both belonging and not belonging to our corporate group, including countries outside the European Union, in the form and manner envisaged in the current law, guaranteeing, in any case, an adequate level of protection.
In any case, personal data shall never be disseminated.
