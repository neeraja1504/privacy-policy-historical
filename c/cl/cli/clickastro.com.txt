Privacy Policy
1. What are the information we collect from you?
Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. offers highly personalized content and services to all its customers. So, when you use or access any of our products/services, we may collect some information about you which are described below.
Use Of IP Address
When you fill the details for availing our services, we track your IP address to find the users location, device type, and also to find if there any problems with our software/services and to help us remember you and your preferences when you revisit our website. An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers, the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing, automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. We may collect I.P. addresses for some purposes (for example, to report anonymous user information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site). We do not ordinarily link a user's I.P. address to a person's personal information, which means we will have a record of each user's session but the user remains anonymous to us. We will use I.P. addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site's terms of use or to protect our service, site, or other users.
Use of Cookies and Server Logs
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for the record–keeping purposes. We occasionally use cookies on the Website. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. We set a persistent cookie to store your toolbar or app name and/or username so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Website. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to use the Website, but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited. Some of our business partners may use cookies on the Website. Such cookies may be used to analyze the Website traffic in the Website and monitor operational performance of the Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party. Server logs capture certain non–Personally Identifying data, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally used to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems. We do not use server logs in any way that may disclose your PII.
We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. You may put astrology as a service, include all these and offer the whole as a package for sale.
Clear Gifs/Web Beacons
The products and services we use to measure and optimize the traffic including visitor feedback and analytic tools may employ a technology called Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). The technology is used to better manage content on the Website by informing us if the content is optimized to meet the needs of the Website visitors. Clear Gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to measure the online movements of Website users in different pages on the Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Clear Gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. does not access PII of Website visitors via the Clear Gifs. The Clear Gifs are solely used for the purposes described in this paragraph.
