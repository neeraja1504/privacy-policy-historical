CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED
Our goal is to ensure the maximum security degree of all information, received from you or other public files. In order to protect such information from unauthorized access, use, copying or disclosure, we use a variety of administrative, technical and physical security tools. The personal information we collect is stored in limited access servers. We have also adopted security measures to protect personal information against accidental or illegal destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other illegal forms of data processing by using firewalls and data encryption.
However, there's no guarantee, that any data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. It is advisable that your computer is provided with software devices for the protection of network data transmission/receipt and that your Internet service provider has taken appropriate measures for the security of network data transmission. The security of your Click2Sell account also relies on your protection of your Click2Sell account password. You may not share your Click2Sell account password with anyone. Click2Sell representatives will never ask you for your password, so any email or other communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious.
