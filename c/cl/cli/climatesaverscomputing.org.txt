The Green Grid › Privacy Policy
The Green Grid Association (“TGG”) respects your privacy choices. We will limit the amount of information we ask of you to what is necessary and will treat it according to this privacy policy.
TGG encourages you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit.
WEB HOSTING: Our site is developed, hosted and maintained by a third party who has access to all information on this site. This "Powered by" partner is responsible for maintaining the privacy described in this statement. The third party retains no rights or privileges associated with the information (i.e. cannot distribute, sell, exchange the information collected).
REGISTRATION AND PERSONAL INFORMATION: In general, when you visit our website, you do not have to disclose any personal information. Personal information means any information that identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Before we ask you for personal information, we will explain how this information will be used and with whom we will share it. Our site requires registration to post/edit personal information, although typically all that's requested is your name, title, an e-mail address, and phone number.
There are occasions where we will ask for information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. Some examples of additional information our website may request are name, address and phone number. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive information from us regarding upcoming events and other news. If you choose not to provide personal information that we request, then we may not be able to provide certain services or information to you.
We also collect information from you when you contact us through our Contact page. We will collect your name and email address in order to follow up on your requests. You may also opt-in to receive updates regarding press releases and events. All we require is your email address and we will send you an email to confirm your subscription.
SECURITY MEASURES: We will not collect personal information from you other than what you supply us on a voluntary basis. TGG stores no information about the visitors to its web site except for information regarding the manner in which the site is used. We use information regarding the manner in which the web site is used only to improve the web site and the content quality. TGG will not display or make available personal information that is not otherwise publicly available. TGG processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on a server outside your own country.
We protect the personal information you share with us. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without receiving your permission.
TGG shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of TGG only in the following limited circumstances:
We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of TGG, its members, or the public as required or permitted by law.
If TGG becomes involved in an assignment, merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who visited a certain part of our site, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular link. Such information does not identify you individually.
LINKED WEB SITES: We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) third party sites. TGG is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites and cannot be held liable for any use of private data that they may create.
COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES: Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated by a visitor to the site. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the site.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our site and your experience visiting our site. We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY: We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems.
