(b) Cookies for the expansion of our reach
So that we can distribute our content in the internet we utilise cookies with your consent in order to display the content of our website on other websites or in social networks.
Google Adsense
clipmyhorse.tv uses the online advertising service, Google AdSense. Advertising is intended through its use to be presented to you which is designed for your interests. These advertisements can be recognised by the information “Google Ads” in each of the advertisements.
Due to your visit to our website Google receives the information that you have called up our website. For this, Google places a cookie on your computer. The data listed under item 3.2.1 of this data protection declaration are transmitted. Additionally, so-called web beacons are utilised; these are invisible graphic images with whose use your user behaviour on our website can be evaluated. The IP address communicated by your browser as part of Google AdSense will not be combined with other Google data. We neither have any influence on the data collected nor is the full extent of the data collection known to us. These data are transmitted to the USA and analysed there. It is possible that these data are passed on to contractual partners of Google and to authorities. This website has also activated Google AdSense advertisements of third-party providers. The above-mentioned data may be transmitted to these third-party providers (the list may be found under https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors?visit_id=0-636589427183379249-3187330481&rd=1).
You can prevent the installation of the Google AdSense cookies in various ways
a) through an appropriate setting in your browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies leads to you receiving no advertisements from third-party providers;
b) by deactivating the Google interest-related advertisements via the link http://www.google.com/ads/preferences, whereby this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies;

Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking
We use the online advertising program “Google AdWords” and, as part of Google AdWords, Conversion Tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). If you click on an advertisement placed by Google, a cookie for Conversion Tracking will be placed onto your computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days, contain no personal data and are thus not used for personal identification.
If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can detect that you have clicked on the advertisement and have been forwarded to this page. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. There is thus no possibility that cookies can be tracked back via the websites of AdWords customers.
The information which is obtained with the aid of the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have decided on Conversion Tracking. From this, customers discover the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and who have been forwarded to a page which is marked with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they receive no information with which users can be personally identified.
We use Google AdWords solely with your consent. You can revoke a consent which you have granted by
proceeding as described above;

More detailed information and the data protection declaration from Google can be found under: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en
Google Tag Manager and Google Publisher Tags
We use the Google Tag Manager from Google on our website. The Google Tag Manager is a solution with which the marketer can manage website tags via a user interface. The Google Tag Manager service itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain and does not collect any personal data. The Google Tag Manager service ensures the triggering of other tags which in turn may collect data under certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access these data. If a deactivation has been undertaken at domain or cookie level, it remains in existence for all tracking tags which are implemented using Google Tag Manager, more detail on this may be found under: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.
Facebook Pixel and links to social media pages
The behaviour of users can be backtracked using Facebook Pixel after they have been forwarded to the website of a provider by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. This behaviour is used to assess the effectiveness of Facebook advertising for statistical and market research purposes and may contribute to the optimisation of future advertising measures. The collected data are anonymous for us and therefore provide us with no indication of the personal identities of the users. However, the data of Facebook are stored and processed so that a connection to the relevant user profile is possible and Facebook is able to use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook data usage guidelines ( https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). They can enable Facebook and its partners to place advertisements within and outside Facebook. Additionally, a cookie may be stored on your computer for these purposes.

You have the right at any time within the terms of Art. 15 of the GDPR to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed; where that is the case, you are furthermore entitled within the terms of Art. 15 of the GDPR to obtain access to the personal data and certain other information (including the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, your rights, any available information as to the source of the data, the existence of automated decision-making and, where personal data are transferred to a third country, the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards) and also the right to obtain a copy of your data.
Right to Rectification:
You have the right, in accordance with Art. 16 of the GDPR to demand from us that we rectify any personal data stored about you if this is inapplicable or inaccurate.
Right to Erasure:
You have the right, based on the conditions given in Art. 17 of the GDPR to demand from us that we erase without delay the personal data relating to you. The right to erasure shall not exist in cases where the processing of personal data is required (i) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, (ii) for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. statutory storage obligations) or (iii) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Right to Restriction of Processing:
You have the right, based on the conditions given in Art. 18 of the GDPR to demand from us that we restrict the processing of your personal data.

You have the right, based on the conditions given in Art. 20 of the GDPR to demand from us that we transfer to you the personal data relating to you which you have provided to us in a structured, accessible and machine-readable format.
Right to Withdrawal of Consent:
You shall have the right to withdraw the consent which you have granted for the processing of personal data at any time with future effect.
Right to Object:
You have the right, based on the conditions given in Art. 21 of the GDPR to object to the processing of your personal data so that we must end the processing of your personal data. The right to object shall be subject to the limits stipulated in Art. 21 of the GDPR. Additionally, our interests may oppose an ending of the processing, meaning that we shall have the right, despite your objection, to process your personal data.
Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority:
You have the right, based on the conditions given in Art. 77 of the GDPR, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR. The right to lodge a complaint shall remain irrespective of any other administrative and judicial remedies.
The regulatory authority with responsibility for us is:
Der Hessische Datenschutzbeauftragte

Obligation for the Provision of Data
You are fundamentally not obliged to communicate your personal data to us. However, if you do not do this, we will not be able to provide our website to you, to be able to answer your enquiries to us and will be unable to enter into a contract with you for our registration-based services.
Automated Decision Making / Profiling
We do not use any systems for automated decision making or profiling (an automated analysis of your personal circumstances).
You shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Article 6 (1) lit. e (performance of a task carried out in the public interest) or Art. 6 (1) lit. f of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (legitimate interests pursued by the controller); this includes profiling based on these provisions. We will no longer process the personal data relating to you unless we are able to prove compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedom or where the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Should the personal data relating to you be processed in order to carry out direct advertising, you shall have the right to file an objection at any time against the processing of the personal data relating to you for the purpose of such advertising. Should you object to the processing for direct advertising purposes, the personal data relating to you shall no longer be processed for these purposes.
