Our use of data collected in Cliniko by a business or practitioner that is Personal Information relating to third parties is limited to providing support and technical assistance to our Customers.
We may use other data for a range of different purposes, provided we comply with applicable law and our contractual commitments.

Where this is the case, we will process other data only for the same purposes as “personal data” under this Privacy Policy.
Other ways we may use your Personal Information:

We work with third-party services in Australia and the USA (such as our web host, data backup and payment provider) that we allow access to Personal Information, and may use it on our behalf strictly for the purposes for which they are engaged. We minimise the amount of personal data that is utilised by these services, and we have ensured that these services process your data in accordance with the appropriate regulations. A list of third-party services (Subprocessors) we use can be found at https://help.cliniko.com/privacy/data-processing/cliniko-subprocessors.

You will be informed of what information is at risk, steps that we have taken to ensure your safety, and what action we are taking or have taken to rectify the breach. To the extent permissible at law, in the event that there is a breach and indirectly collected information is at risk, we will follow the same protocol, however the affected Customers (rather than the individuals) will be notified instead.
