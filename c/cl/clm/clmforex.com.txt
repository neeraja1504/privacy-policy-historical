Internal Procedure for dealing with communications
The three key steps Core Liquidity Markets follows:
Consent – Only commercial electronic messages are sent with the addressee’s consent – either express or inferred consent.
Identify – Electronic messages will include clear and accurate information about the person and the company that is responsible for sending the commercial electronic message.
Unsubscribe – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe facility is included in all our commercial electronic messages and deal with unsubscribe requests promptly.
Consented to such communications
Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have given consent. This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is okay to send the message, or messages of that nature or inferred consent based on our business or other relationship with you and your conduct.
Comply with the law regarding viral messages
Core Liquidity Markets ensures that Commercial Communications that include a Forwarding Facility contain a clear recommendation that the Recipient should only forward the Commercial Communication to persons with whom they have a relationship, where that relationship means that person could be said to have consented to receiving Commercial Communications.
Comply with the age sensitive content of commercial communication
Where the content of a Commercial Communication seeks to promote or inspire interaction with a product, service or event that is age sensitive, the Core Liquidity Markets takes reasonable steps to ensure that such content is sent to Recipients who are legally entitled to use or participate in the product service or event.
