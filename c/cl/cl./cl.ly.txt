Our Privacy Policy
We at CloudApp recognize that you expect privacy and security when it comes to information that personally identifies you and allows you to be individually contacted ("Personal Information"). We adopted the following online privacy policy because we understand the need to safeguard the information you may be providing to us at our websites.

Why we request information about you
CloudApp collects and retains Personal Information about you only when you have communicated with us by email (we'll collect your email address), when you register to use CloudApp's services (we'll ask for your name and email address), and when you register for paid services (we'll ask for general information such as your name, email address, billing address, and credit card information).
‍
We use that information to transact business with you and deliver requested services from time to time, as well as services improvement, contact, and research.

How we protect your information
The information we receive from you is protected against unauthorized access once we receive it. We limit the access to your information to employees who have a business reason for accessing it. When collecting financial information from you, we use secure socket layer software (SSL).

Data Storage
CloudPlus uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run CloudApp. Although CloudPlus owns the code, databases, and all rights to the CloudApp application, you retain all rights to your data.
