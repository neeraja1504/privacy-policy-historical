As of December 15, 2014, Trepster, LLC. (“ClubDistrict” or “we”) operates ClubDistrict.com. This Privacy Policy describes ClubDistrict’s use and sharing of personal information (“PI”-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) that Members voluntarily provide to ClubDistrict when they register (also known as “Registration PII”). The Term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by ClubDistrict, including any ClubDistrict-branded URL (the “ClubDistrict Website”), mobile technologies, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by ClubDistrict in connection with the ClubDistrict Website (collectively, the “ClubDistrict Services”). The ClubDistrict Services are hosted in the United States.
The ClubDistrict Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect PI from children under 13 years of age.
From time to time ClubDistrict may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PI collection and use practices, the features of the ClubDistrict Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by ClubDistrict on the ClubDistrict Website. Your continued use of the ClubDistrict Services after ClubDistrict posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If ClubDistrict materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PI, your PI will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.
COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PI AND NON-PI ON CLUBDISTRICT
General. When ClubDistrict collects PI from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PI to us in order to register as a Member of ClubDistrict. ClubDistrict may also collect PI from you if you choose to participate in ClubDistrict Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to ClubDistrict for review.
In addition, ClubDistrict collects other non-PI including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the ClubDistrict Services, track usage, and for security purposes.
ClubDistrict Members may also choose to provide or store non-PI information in their profiles, including but not limited to date of birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively “Profile Information”). The Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.
ClubDistrict Members can change their Registration PI and Profile Information at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members and ClubDistrict communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit Profile” portion of their ClubDistrict profile.

NOTICE: CLUBDISTRICT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PI COLLECTION PRACTICES
When you voluntarily provide PI to ClubDistrict, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses ClubDistrict will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
At the time you provide your PI, ClubDistrict will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PI (See “Choice” below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, ClubDistrict will not share your PI with third parties unless you have given ClubDistrict permission to do so (See “Use” below).
ClubDistrict Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. ClubDistrict Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. ClubDistrict is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the ClubDistrict Services or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave ClubDistrict Services via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PI they collect from you.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
ClubDistrict Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with. Users who visit those Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
ClubDistrict may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions, information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions and other non-PI about you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests. For example, based on your music interests we might display an advertisement to make sure you are advised when your favorite band is coming to town. The information used for this feature does not provide your PI or identify you as an individual to third parties.
Some of the advertisements that appear on ClubDistrict Services may also be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PI about your visit to or use of ClubDistrict Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address.
Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party developers may also be available on the ClubDistrict Services. Third party applications are small bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into Members’ profiles or shared with other Users. However, ClubDistrict does not control the third party developers, and cannot dictate their actions. When a Member engages with a third party application, that Member is interacting with the third party developer, not with ClubDistrict. ClubDistrict encourages Members not to provide PI to the third party’s application unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.
CHOICE: CLUBDISTRICT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PI
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, ClubDistrict will get your permission before we use the PI you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or share your PI with third parties that are not affiliated with ClubDistrict.

ClubDistrict also may share your PI with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so.

ClubDistrict prohibits these companies from sharing your non-PI and/or Profile Information with any third party or from using it for any other purpose.
