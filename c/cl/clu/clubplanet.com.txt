PRIVACY POLICY
Clubplanet.com and its member sites are committed to protecting the personal privacy rights of all our customers and consider all personal information as private and confidential.
Clubplanet.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all of our current and future member web sites.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. In addition, our web servers track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), a unique member name, and demographic information (like their zip code, age group, or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. Users may opt-out of the sharing of their information with other companies, as well as opt-out of receiving future mailings from us; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. Users may opt-out of the sharing of their information with other companies, as well as opt-out of receiving future mailings fro m us; see the choice/opt-out section below.
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. Users may opt-out of the sharing of their information with other companies, as well as opt-out of receiving future mailings from us; see the choice/opt-out section below.
We will not disclose customer name, addresses, or account information to unaffiliated parties, other than:
where the customer requests or consents to disclosure
where we are legally required to do so (e.g. in response to a subpoena or fraud investigation)
where we have agreed to provide information under negotiated contracts and where the customer has been informed about the possibility of sharing information for marketing or other similar purposes through a prior direct communication and the customer has been given the reasonable opportunity and time to decline.
