This Privacy Policy applies when you (“you,” “Subscriber” or “End User”) access, visit or use any portion of the Services. To better understand this Privacy Policy, a Subscriber is our customer – this is the individual or business entity that contracts with us to receive Services. Subscribers are the controllers of all Subscriber Data kept and stored in the ClubReady System, which includes End User Data, a subset of Subscriber Data. Subscribers are data controllers. “End Users” are the members, customers and clients of Subscribers. End Users create user accounts within the ClubReady System and regularly interact with our products and services. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in ClubReady’s Terms of Service.
2. AGREEMENT TO TERMS OF PRIVACY POLICY. You are not required to provide any personal information to ClubReady unless you choose to access features of the Services that require such information. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or ClubReady’s Terms of Service, then please do not provide us with personal information, exit the ClubReady System immediately, and refrain from using our Services. By accessing, visiting or using our Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described in the Agreement.
3. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. You may be required to accept the amended Privacy Policy upon logging into the ClubReady System in order to continue using Services. We may post any material changes to this Privacy Policy on the Sites with a notice advising of the changes in advance of the effective date of the changes. We may also notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy, before or after the effective date of the changes, by sending an email or in another conspicuous manner reasonably designated to notify you. If you do not agree with the new Privacy Policy, you may terminate using the Services within the applicable thirty (30) day period and you will not be bound by the new terms. Otherwise, the new terms will take effect after thirty (30) days.
4. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. Both Subscribers and End Users use our Services. The information we receive from Subscribers and End Users, and how we handle it differs, as set out below:
4.1 Subscribers. As a Subscriber, we collect information relating to you and your use of our Services from a variety of sources:
(a) Information we collect directly from Subscribers.
(i) Site Set-Up: information provided to us so that we can set up your club site(s) and establish your ClubReady account settings.

(iv) Information from third parties: we might collect your personal information or data from third parties if a Subscriber gives permission to those third parties to share such information with us.
(v) Information from cookies and web beacons: we use third party tracking services that use cookies and web beacons to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our Sites. This data may include usage and Subscriber statistics.
4.2 End Users. As an End User of the ClubReady System, when you interact with our Services, we collect, on behalf and at the direction of our Subscribers, information relating to you and/or your use of our Services from a variety of sources:
(a) Information we collect directly from End Users. We collect and store personal information about you as lawfully directed by our Subscribers. (The facility where you receive fitness-related products or services will be associated with a specific Subscriber, as well as a club site set-up within the ClubReady System where you would be listed as an End User under your own account). Subscribers are responsible for collecting and managing all End User Data, and will oftentimes implement their own privacy policies. We do not direct, nor are we responsible for, the End User Data that our Subscribers collect. If you have any questions about the personal information collected about you by a Subscriber, please contact the Subscriber directly. In most cases, End User information will be limited to data necessary to provide you with the Subscriber’s goods or services, including personal information (for example, name, address, contact information) and payment information (for example, payor information, billing address, credit card number, expiration date, security code, bank account and routing number).
(b) Information we collect about End Users from other sources.
(i) Usage data: we collect usage data about you whenever End Users interact with our Services.
(ii) Device and application data: we collect data about the devices and applications used when connecting to or accessing our Services, including but not limited to, IP address and browser type. We can usually infer geographic data based on an End User’s IP address.
(iii) Referral data: if you visit our Sites from an external source (like another website or via email link), we might record information about the source that referred you to us.
(iv) Information from cookies and web beacons: we use third party tracking services that use cookies and web beacons to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our Sites. This data may include usage and Subscriber statistics.
(c) ClubReady’s obligations as a data processor when processing End User data on behalf of our Subscribers. When ClubReady is processing End User Data, including but not limited to Cardholder Data, on behalf of Subscribers, the Subscriber who pays for, manages and otherwise controls the club site(s) at the physical location(s) where End User is a member, customer or client is the data controller with respect to such data, and ClubReady is the data processor. For the remainder of this Privacy Policy, Subscriber shall be referred to as the “Data Controller” and ClubReady as the “Data Processor.”
For the processing of End User Data on behalf of the Data Controller, the Data Processor undertakes to fulfill the following obligations:
(i) To treat the personal data only to carry out the provisions of the contracted Services, in accordance with the instructions given in writing, at any time, by the Data Controller (unless there is a legal rule that requires complementary processing, in such a case, the Data Processor will inform the Data Controller of that legal requirement prior to the processing, unless the law prohibits it on public interest grounds).
(ii) To maintain the duty of secrecy with respect to the personal data to which the Data Processor has access, even after the termination of the contractual relationship, and to ensure that its employees have committed in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the personal data processed.
(iii) To ensure, taking into account the available technology, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, that they will apply adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, where appropriate, among other things: the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data; the ability of ensuring the continued confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the systems and services; the ability of restoring the availability and access to personal data quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident; a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures in order to ensure the safety of the processing; and maintaining applicable payment card industry (PCI) security standards relative to the processing of certain Cardholder Data. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, special account shall be taken of the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as a consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or unlawful alternation of the personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or unauthorized access to such data.
(iv) To keep under their control and custody the personal data to which they have access in relation with the provision of the Services, and to not disclose them, neither transfer or otherwise communicate them, not even for their preservation, to persons unrelated to the provision of the Services covered by this Agreement. However, the Data Controller may authorize, expressly and in writing, the Data Processor to use another data processor (hereinafter, a “Subcontractor”) whose full company name and address, and subcontracted services, shall be communicated to the Data Controller prior to the provision of the services. The Data Processor will also make reasonable efforts to notify the Data Controller of any upcoming changes in Subcontractor services, giving the Data Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Data Processor, by operation of this Privacy Policy, hereby provides adequate notice of its use of Vantiv, LLC, having its principal office at 8500 Governors Hill Drive, Symmes Township, OH 45249-1384, as its designated payment processor. The Data Processor will obtain from any Subcontractor guarantees that it has put into place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards so that the processing complies with any applicable regulations. In addition, access to the data is granted to companies and professionals that the Data Processor has hired in their internal organizational framework in order to provide general or maintenance services (IT services, consulting, audits, etc.) as long as such tasks have not been arranged by the Data Processor with the purpose of subcontracting with a third party all of part of the Services provided to the Data Controller.
(v) To delete or return to the Data Controller, at their choosing, all personal data to which they have had access in order to provide the Services, unless such actions are limited or prohibited by a separate agreement with the End User or by applicable law. Likewise, the Data Processor undertakes to delete any existing copies, unless there is a legal rule that requires the preservation of the personal data. However, employees and other personnel working for the Data Processor are entitled to access Subscriber Data, including End User Data, as required to carry out their obligations under the terms of any contract signed with ClubReady or an affiliated entity.
(vi) To notify the Data Controller, without undue delay, of any personal data security breaches of which Data Processor becomes aware, giving support to the Data Controller in the notification to any affected End Users or any applicable Data Protection Agency, as well as to provide support, when necessary, in the carrying-out of privacy impact assessments.
(vii) To make available, upon written request, a record of all categories of processing activities performed on behalf of the Data Controller.
(viii) To cooperate with any applicable Data Protection Agency (or with some other control authority) in the fulfillment of its power. If the Data Processor or any of its Subcontractors violate this Agreement or any regulation when determining the purposes and means of the processing, they shall be held responsible for such processing. Furthermore, if such Subcontractors are based in countries which do not have a legislation on data protection which is equivalent to the EU legislation (“Third Countries”), Data Processor shall establish all safeguards required by the EU legislation in order to comply with all obligations arising from transfers of data to Third Countries, and shall promptly inform Data Controller about such safeguards if so requested.
