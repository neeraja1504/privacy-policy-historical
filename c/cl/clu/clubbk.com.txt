Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
Certain non-personal information about visits to the Site is recorded by the standard operation of the internet servers on which the Site is hosted. The non-personal information that we collect may include IP addresses, the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, and the site the visitor was on immediately before visiting the Site. We may offer children many fun features on the Site, such as games and screen savers that do not require children to provide any personal information. In using these features, however, Burger King Corporation may collect certain non-personal information from children by using small text files known as cookies. We use cookies for several purposes, such as to recognize visitors to our websites, to determine the number of unique visitors to our websites, to ascertain which website pages they visit, and to conduct internal reviews of our site. We may associate information we collect via cookies with the personal information we collect from or about our visitors who are at least 13 years old, which we explain in the "Collection and Use of Personal Information" section of this privacy policy. We may use the combined information, for example, to personalize your child's experience on the website or to personalize marketing communications we may send to your child. You are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so your child may not be able to use certain features on our websites. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to configure your browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform you when you receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from your hard drive. We may also use web beacons to count page visits by our users, to access our cookies, and otherwise to improve your experience on the Site. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. If you or your child who is at least 13 has registered to receive BK CROWN TM/MC Program emails (kids under 13 cannot register to receive email), we may also use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened and acted upon, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please refer to your Profile on your Parent Dashboard.
Web beacons also help us manage online advertising, and are provided by our ad management Service Providers. These files enable our ad management Service Providers to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with a Service Provider. With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Our advertising Service Providers also use anonymous information about users' visits to this and other websites in order to deliver advertisements online that may be of interest to them.

During the registration process, parents and visitors who are 18 and older may choose to opt-in to promotional and/or website features. These may include emails that we send you on behalf of one of our promotional partners.
