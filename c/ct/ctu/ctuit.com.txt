Use of Cookies
The System uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Ctuit Software pages, or register with the Website or Ctuit Software services, a cookie helps Ctuit Software to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Ctuit Software features that you customized.
We also utilize Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our System. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visits the System, what pages they visit and what other websites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data collected to track and examine the use of the System, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the System to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the System is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available here.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Ctuit Software services or the Websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We take commercially reasonable measures to protect information transmitted via or stored on the System. However, we cannot guarantee that information that users of the System may transmit or otherwise supply will be totally secure. You agree to immediately notify us of any breach of System's security, this Privacy Policy, or the Terms and Conditions of Use of which you become aware.
California Privacy Rights

To request the above information, please email us at: privacy@ctuit.com with a reference to California Disclosure Information.
California and Delaware “Do Not Track” Disclosures
