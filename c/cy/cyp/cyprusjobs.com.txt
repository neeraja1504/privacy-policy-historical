INFORMATION COLLECTED BY CYPRUSNET
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data
CyprusNet delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the hundreds of web sites that are a part of CyprusNet's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we collect what is known as 'Click Stream Data.' Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us.
In addition to the Click Stream Data collected across, CyprusNet owns numerous web sites and services, and collects information at those sites.
As a part of the registration process at these sites, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as 'non-personally identifiable data'), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.
Personally-Identifiable Consumer Data
At some of the sites owned and operated by CyprusNet we ask people to register and provide personally-identifiable data. CyprusNet is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all consumers before the personally-identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally-identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and e-mail address. Web surfers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below.
Other Information That Is Collected
At some sites, including this one, CyprusNet collects information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with CyprusNet ('business information').
We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third-parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.
HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED
The non-personally identifiable data that CyprusNet collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.
If a consumer elects to provide CyprusNet with personally-identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other CyprusNet sales and marketing efforts.

Like many other Web sites, Cyprus Publishers makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user 's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
