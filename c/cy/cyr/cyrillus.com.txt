We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal data via strict procedures in our company. For data collected on the website, we use the secure SSL protocol (Secure Socket Layer) which guarantees a high level of protection.
To ensure payment security, CYRILLUS uses the services of PCI-DSS-certified providers. This standard is an international security standard whose objectives are to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of cardholder data, thereby securing card and transaction data protection.
When you pay by credit card, our ordering system connects in real time with the system of our payment service providers, which collects your data and performs various checks to avoid abuse and fraud. The data is stored on the servers of these payment providers and is not transmitted on CYRILLUS servers at any time.
Thus, when you enter your card number (credit card), authorization searches are automatically transmitted in encrypted mode. The authorizations and data are then checked with your bank to avoid abuses and fraud.
During your payment, you have the possibility to save the details of your credit card to facilitate your future purchases on the website. This information is thus recorded and secured with our partners subject to the PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). You can view the list of your saved cards (in hidden mode), but also delete all or part of its contents.
In order to debit the account during billing or credit following a return, our payment providers keep the bank details associated with the authorization number, the time required to complete the transaction and the processing of any claims (returns, litigation).
