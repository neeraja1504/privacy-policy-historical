HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below. We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you and to notify you when you have won one of our contests. We may share information you provide about yourself with our trusted partners, affiliates, subsidiaries and franchisees, including, without limitation, CycleBar International Inc., CycleBar Worldwide Inc. CycleGiving Inc., CB IP, LLC, LB Franchising, LLC and Fueled Collective Franchising, LLC and any other brands we or our affiliates may come to acquire, represent, or otherwise obtain a financial interest in (collectively our “Business Partners”) in order to communicate special promotions or offers. We might also tell you about new features or products. These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting. We may share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we share information with vendors who help us manage our online registration process or who assist us in providing the Services. Some vendors may be located outside of the United States. We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our customer list as part of that transaction. We may share information with our Business Partners. For example, if we are working with a third party and running a joint promotion, and we may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.
USE OF NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request when: (i) permitted or required by law; (ii) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or (iii) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes. Agents and contractors of CycleBar who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for CycleBar. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. Finally, CycleBar will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

COOKIE/TRACKING TECHNOLOGY
To enhance your experience with our site may use “Cookies” and tracking technology depending upon the features offered.

Cookies and tracking technology, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our site. The reason cookie and tracking technology are useful to us is for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the website, understanding how visitors use the website, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you can explore your web browser’s options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow cookies altogether. You should be aware that prohibiting the use of cookies will significantly restrict access to certain types of content or features.
