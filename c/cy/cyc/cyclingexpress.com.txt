Privacy & Security
Security
Secure Shopping at Cycling Express
Cycling Express strives to be the Australia’s favorite, top value, and best service one stop bike shop, so we take our customers security very, very seriously.
The security measures we have in place are industry benchmarks and as close to impenetrable as possible. We review all of our security measures on an ongoing basis to make sure that they are current with industry standards.
When you pay for your order at Cycling Express with a credit or debit card, Securepay, one of Australia’s leading online secure banks processes your protected payment. This means that payment is made instantly through Securepay’s safe banking system allowing Cycling Express to avoid the need to ever see or store your card details like some other websites.
However, if you are still concerned about sharing your card details you can also pay at Cycling Express using PayPal; this way you can choose not to use a credit or debit card if you prefer not to.
Other ways you can prevent fraud
Cycling Express is yet to have any fraudulent transactions occur but just to make sure there are a couple of simple things you can do to decrease or eliminate the possibility of fraudulent activity.
You can avoid anyone attempting to use you identity by using a strong password combining letters and numbers, not writing your password down anywhere and by using an up to date web browser (Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer). Changing your password regularly and not using the same password on multiple sites will also help prevent any possible illegal activity.
If you are using a public computer, such as in an Internet café, at school or on a shared computer, always log out when you've finished using Cycling Express. Remember that Cycling Express will not e-mail or call you to ask you to disclose or verify your password, credit card or bank account number. So, you should only give out this information when you contact us directly or when you check-out on the Cycling Express website.
If you receive unsolicited e-mails that ask you to provide your Cycling Express password or any personal or banking information, do not reply to the request and immediately report the incident to us so that we can investigate. You can contact us at help@cyclingexpress.com or via our direct hotline between the hours of 9am-5pm AEST.
Paypal at Cycling Express
If you decide you would prefer to check out using PayPal you can do this without opening a PayPal account, as Paypal now offer direct payment using Credit or Debit. Alternatively if you already have an account with PayPal you can use this to check out quickly and securely. Paypal does not charge an admin fee to use their checkout facility.
Purchasing with PayPal at Cycling Express
Simply add the items you would like to purchase to your basket, then checkout in the usual way. Next, select PayPal as the payment method and follow the provided instructions.
At this point you will be redirected to PayPal’s secure checkout facility. Here simply choose how your payment method and then click the 'Review Payment' button to return to Cycling Express.
Check all the order details are correct and then click 'Confirm Order'. PayPal will then charge you for the order total. If the order is successfully created you will be redirected to a thank you page showing your order number and items ordered.
You will subsequently receive two emails, one from Cycling Express to confirm the order you have just made and one from PayPal to confirm your payment.
Please note; orders over $600 in value or containing a bike will require you to use a PayPal 'confirmed' address for security purposes. You can create a 'confirmed' address by signing up for a PayPal account and fulfilling PayPal’s requirements for a confirmed address. Alternatively, to avoid this you can simply pay with a credit card or Visa Debit card.
Priority Dispatch Feature
We don’t have a priority dispatch feature like some other online sites. At Cycling Express we treat every order as a priority dispatch without charging you any extra.
This means that your order will be dispatched within 24 hours* of our having received it no matter what!
*Business Hours.
