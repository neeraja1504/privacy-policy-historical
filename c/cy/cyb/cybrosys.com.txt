Each Company That Reach European Citizens Must Comply With GDPR
On the 25th of May 2018, the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, was placed into action in each of the twenty-eight nations in Europe. The GDPR is a fresh rule agreed by the European Union that wants to enhance transparency and the efficiency of information protection activities. It affects how companies must describe and get consent for fresh and current prospects from users that subscribe to their email lists and data about the users are saved inside the CRM and other processes.
Apart from the EU members, you must understand that that any business which markets products or services to EU citizens, not considering its location, is subject to this regulation. By complying with GDPR needs, companies will avoid paying expensive penalties when enhancing customer information protection and trust.
After this privacy rule has been active, websites which shall not comply will be unreachable to European nations. Many famous websites were temporarily blocked such as the Chicago Tribune and LA Times. If your company website gathers any of the regulated information from European citizens — that company is legally responsible to comply with GDPR.
