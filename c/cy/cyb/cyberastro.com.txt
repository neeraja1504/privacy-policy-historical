What personal information do we collect?
Registration Data
During membership registration, Cyber Astro collects personal information including your name, gender, email address, your current hometown and birth data information including your time of birth. This information is used strictly to generate your personal horoscopes online. Your email address is used to identify your unique birth data record in the database, since an email address is always unique and has no duplicates. You do not have to provide any personal information to use Cyber Astro services. However, if you choose not to become a member of Club Cyber Astro, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other services dependent upon the collection of such information, such as your personalized free predictions.
