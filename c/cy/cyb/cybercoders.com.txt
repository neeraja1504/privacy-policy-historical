Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data that are based on your Internet activity and stored on the hard drive of your computer by your Internet browser when you visit a Website. Through the use of cookies, We are able to collect traffic, usage and other similar information about your interactions with the Services (e.g. time spent on the Services, the specific portions of the Services that you use or visit, language preferences, IP address, device IDs, browser information and characteristics, operating system, geolocation, demographic data, referring URLS, etc.), as Well as recognize your computer or device to facilitate your use of the Services (e.g., to display information more efficiently). We may use this type of information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing usage patterns, monitoring and improving the Services, personalizing your interactions with the Services, tracking Internet activity and supporting Our marketing efforts. When you visit the Services or other Websites where We advertise, We or a third party may use Other Information collected through the Services to show you interest-based advertisements and offers that We think will be more relevant to your preferences and behaviors. Cookies enable us to personalize these advertisements and track their frequency and placement.
Although most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can generally find a "help" section on the browser toolbar that will inform you how to configure your browser settings to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to reject cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not have access to many features that make your interactions with the Services more efficient and some of the Services' features may not function properly.
Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies: A Web beacon (sometimes referred to as a "pixel tag" or a "clear GIF") is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a Website, e-mail, or other communication. Web beacons are typically one-pixel, transparent images and are used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that individual with previously acquired information about him/her in a database. They allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that accesses the Website on which the beacon appears, the URL of such a Website, the time that such a Website was viewed, the type of browser used to view such a Website and the information contained in any cookies set by the third party. We may use Web beacons and other similar tracking technologies to help us better manage content on the Services by informing us what content is effective. For example, Web beacons allow us to measure the success of Our marketing campaigns by providing insight into the actions taken by users of the Services (e.g., compiling statistics about the rate at which certain marketing e-mails are opened by their intended recipients). These technologies may also be used to help us remember who you are and track your account preferences.

Aggregated Information: Occasionally, CyberCoders will combine Personal Information and other data to create de-identified information about groups or particular types of individuals that access the Services.
