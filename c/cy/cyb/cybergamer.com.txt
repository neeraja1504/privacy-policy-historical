Privacy Policy
Plain English Terms
The General Terms below are complicated legal terms that serve to protect us and make it clear the privacy terms that will apply to users of LPL services. These terms below are here to give you a simple explanation of what the General Terms really mean in plain English.
However, these plain English terms are not legally binding and the General Terms are still the legal terms that will apply if anything goes wrong.
Personal Information: LPL stores your Personal Information when you use our service. Because we keep this information, LPL takes on the legal responsibilities that come with storing that information.
Your Rights: You have rights to be able to access, amend and delete your Personal Information on request.
Log data: When you visit our service, LPL collects data that your browser sends to us. This includes IP address, browser version, time and date of visit, and other statistics.
Cookies: Our service uses cookies to collect data and improve itself. You can either accept or refuse these cookies and know when it is being sent to you. If you refuse, you might not be able to use some parts of our service.
Security: LPL's data is encrypted and securely stored via Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage and database services. All passwords are hashed, so no one is able to view them, including LPL.
Social Media and other Links: When you click on a third-party link to another site that is not operated by us, we have no control over or responsibility for the content or privacy policies of these other sites.
Age Restriction: Those under the age of 13 are not able to access the Service. If someone under 13 years of age provides us with any information, we will immediately delete it and remove that person's consent.

This platform allows players, viewers and partners access to a global esports network that includes tournament broadcasts, managing tournaments, talent management and events (Service). This Privacy Policy applies to persons subscribing to the Insider's Guide (IG) and those participating in LPL tournaments (Users) via the internet website https://letsplay.live/ (Website).
This privacy policy is used to inform you of LPL’s policies relating to the use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. When we talk about Personal Information, we mean information relating to you or other identifiable individuals.
By using the Service, you agree to be bound by the terms of the then current privacy policy (Privacy Policy). LPL reserves the right, at any time, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy.

Your use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
For the subscription to LPL's tournament platform, LPL uses the so-called double opt in procedure, i.e. the registration is not complete until the user has confirmed his or her registration by clicking on the link contained in a confirmation email sent to his or her for this purpose. If the User does not confirm the subscription, his or her subscription to LPL platform will automatically be deleted from LPL's database.
You can unsubscribe from any LPL offering (including the IG and tournaments) at any time by sending an email to hello@letsplay.live.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, which is accessible at https://letsplay.live/terms unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

Storage of Personal Information
LPL is a New Zealand company with its head-office located in Auckland, New Zealand, but which also operates in Australia. For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), New Zealand is considered a country which provides adequate protections for Personal Information, as confirmed by the European Commission in Commission Decision 2013/65/EU.
LPL uses third-party service providers (such as managed hosting providers, card processors, CRM systems, and technology partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage and other services that we use to operate the Service. Some of these providers may not be located in New Zealand or Australia.
By using the Service or submitting any Personal Information to LPL via the Service, you consent to LPL and its authorized service partners using your Personal Information in New Zealand and Australia in order to make the Service available to you. Please be aware that the privacy protections and the rights of authorities and government agencies to access your Personal Information in some of these countries may not be equivalent to those in your country.
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or statutory reporting requirements.
In order to determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the following factors; the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We may retain certain information subsequent to the termination of your account, for example if it is necessary to fulfil our legal obligations or to exercise, to maintain security, to prevent fraud and abuse and to defend or enforce our rights.
LPL has appointed a Privacy Officer who can be contacted at privacy@letsplay.live.
