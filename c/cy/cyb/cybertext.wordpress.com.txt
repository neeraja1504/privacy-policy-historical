Privacy Policy | CyberText Newsletter
Your privacy is very important to me. As part of WordPress.com, certain personal identifiable information is collected and stored during your visit and as you interact with this blog.
General
This blog is hosted by WordPress.com, which is owned by Automattic, and thus these Automattic policies apply:
General Data Protection Register legislation: https://automattic.com/automattic-and-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/
Privacy Notice for Visitors to Our Users’ Sites: https://automattic.com/privacy-notice/
Privacy Policy: https://automattic.com/privacy/.
Specifically, the Automattic Privacy Policy includes these statements:
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, polldaddy.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, and akismet.com);

Data Collected and Used
Interacting with this blog by commenting or subscribing means that some personal identifiable data is automatically collected and stored during your visit.
Commenting
WordPress.com uses Akismet spam control to minimise the spam received. This information is sent to Akismet for the sole purpose of spam checking: commenter’s name, email address, URL, IP address, and user agent (e.g. browser used, device’s operating system). Akismet minimises the need for repeated CAPTCHA processes for visitors to this blog who wish to comment.
The first time you comment on a post or page, I will be alerted that your comment is in the pending (or occasionally, the spam) folder. After reviewing your comment, I can choose to accept it or not. Once your first comment is accepted, you should be able to comment without needing further approval. As part of the comment process, you must submit your name (real or an alias), your email address, and, optionally, a web page address (URL). Also collected and stored automatically are the submission date/time you made the comment, and your IP address. If you decide to comment on any post or page while logged into and using a WordPress account, your user ID on that account as well as its URL (if available) will also be collected.
Your email address, which only I can see, will not be shown on the blog, and I do not disclose that detail to anyone without your permission, except as required by law. If I need to provide a complex or confidential answer to your comment, I may decide to reply directly to you in detail (via the email address you provided), and/or provide a brief or edited response on the blog. If you email me directly, all information in addition to your name, email address, and URL will be kept private and confidential and will only be used to directly respond to you via email. Any additional information you provide when contacting me will not be shared with any third parties and will be deleted after a reasonable period of time.
Your data will not be shared or sold to any third parties except in compliance with law authorities.
Subscribing/Unsubscribing
You can choose to read my blog posts as and when it suits you (via a web browser), subscribe by email (you will receive an email for each new post), or follow using an RSS feed.
If you subscribe via email and later wish to unsubscribe from the blog, you can click the unsubscribe link displayed at the bottom of each email. You can ‘unfollow’ this blog via your RSS feed software. I have no way of unsubscribing or unfollowing you directly.

Information collected about user activities on this blog includes user’s country (based on their IP address), links that are clicked, and any search terms used when accessing the blog via certain search engines or while viewing the blog. This information gives me general details of where blog users come from and which posts/pages are most viewed. I may share these general statistics in my annual blog summary.
