NOTICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY PRACTICES
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU
CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
CCRM is required to maintain the privacy of your health information and to provide you with a notice of its legal
duties and privacy practices. We will not use or disclose your health information except as described in this
Notice. This Notice applies to all of the medical records generated by CCRM as well as records we receive from
other providers.
USE & DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION IN TREATMENT, PAYMENT & HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS
Treatment: CCRM may use and disclose your protected health information in the course of providing or managing
your health care as well as any related services. For the purpose of treatment, we may coordinate your health care with a
third party. For example, we may disclose your protected health information to a pharmacy to fulfill a prescription for
medication, to a radiology facility to order an X-ray, or to another physician who is assisting in your health care. In addition,
we may disclose protected health information to other health care providers related to the treatment provided by those other
providers.
Payment: When needed CCRM will use or disclose your protected health information to obtain payment for its
services. Such uses or disclosures may include disclosures to your health insurer to get approval for a recommended
procedure or to determine whether you are eligible for benefits or whether a particular service is covered under your health
plan. When obtaining payment for your health care, we may also disclose your protected health information to your
insurance company to demonstrate the medical necessity of the care or for utilization review when required to do so by your
insurance company. Finally, we may also disclose your protected health information to another provider where that provider
is involved in your care and requires the information to obtain payment.
Operations: CCRM may use or disclose your protected health information when needed for the practice’s health
care operations for the purposes of management or administration of the practice and for offering quality health care services.
Health care operations may include: (1) quality evaluations and improvement activities; (2) employee review activities and
training programs; (3) accreditation, certification, licensing, or credentialing activities; (4) reviews and audits such as
compliance reviews, medical reviews, legal services, and maintaining compliance programs; and (5) business management
and general administrative activities. For instance, we may use, as needed, protected health information of patients to review
their treatment course when making quality assessments regarding ophthalmologic care or treatment. In addition, we may
disclose your protected health information to another provider or health plan for their health care operations.
Other Uses and Disclosures: As part of treatment, payment, and health care operations, CCRM may also use or
disclose your protected health information to: (1) remind you of an appointment; (2) inform you of potential treatment
alternatives or options; or (3) inform you of health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.
USES & DISCLOSURES TO WHICH YOU MAY OBJECT
Family/Friends: CCRM may disclose your protected health information to a friend or family member who is
involved in your medical care. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. In addition, we may
disclose protected health information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be
notified about your condition, status and location. If you have any objection to the use and disclosure of your protected
health information in this manner, please tell us.
USES & DISCLOSURES THAT ARE REQUIRED OR PERMITTED WITHOUT YOUR AUTHORIZATION
Research: Under certain circumstances, CCRM may use and disclose your protected health information to
approved clinical research studies. While most clinical research studies require specific patient consent, there are some
instances where a retrospective record review with no patient contact may be conducted by such researchers. For example,
the research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of patients who received one medication for their
medical condition to those who received a different medication for that same condition.
Regulatory Agencies: CCRM may disclose your protected health information to government and certain private
health oversight agencies, e.g., the Department of Public Health and Environment or the Board of Medical Examiners, for
activities authorized by law, including, but not limited to, licensure, certification, audits, investigations and inspections.
These activities are necessary to monitor compliance with the requirements of government programs.

as required by law or in response to a court order or other process in litigation.
Public Health: As required by law, CCRM may disclose your protected health information to public health or legal
authorities charged with preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability. For example, we are required to report the
existence of a communicable disease, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome ("AIDS"), to the Department of Public
Health and Environment to protect the health and well-being of the general public.
Workers’ Compensation: CCRM may release protected health information about you for workers' compensation or
similar programs. These programs provide benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.

HIPAA, its amendments or regulations.

Other than the circumstances described above, CCRM will not disclose your protected health information unless you

purposes. You may revoke your authorization in writing at any time except to the extent that we have already taken action in
reliance upon the authorization.
