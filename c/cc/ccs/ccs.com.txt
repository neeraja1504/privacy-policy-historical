Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is a top priority to us. CCS Direct, LLC ("CCS") has created this privacy policy in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site (the "Site"). This policy is effective as of December 22, 2014.
What we collect:
We may collect your name, age, address, e-mail address, phone number, payment information, account username and passwords ("Personal Information"). We will need this information to complete and process your order and provide certain services to you. Personal Information is viewed only by the owners and employees of CCS if they are involved in the handling of your account or in the completion, delivery or customer support of your order.
How this information is used:
The order is processed and kept for record-keeping purposes. Your e-mail address and phone number may be used to contact you if we have a question regarding your order. We will never call your phone number if it is not related to your order.
Personal Information may be disclosed to trusted persons working together with CCS if they are involved in the completion, delivery or customer support of your order or services we provide. Examples include third parties who assist in hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We also may share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to the Site with third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Site and how those visitors use the Site.
We may disclose information we collect from and about you to carefully-selected third party partners, so that they may inform you of offers, promotions and services. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
If you provide CCS with Personal Information, that information may be used, and you have consented for CCS to use the information, to: operate and improve the Site; provide and deliver the products and services we offer; allow you to create an account; create a profile for you based on information that you have provided; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; request feedback; notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that may interest you; and assist in connection with the collection of any debts owed by you to CCS.
CCS may share such information with ASW Distribution, LLC and other subsidiaries and affiliates. We may also share your information to carefully-selected third parties so that they may inform you of offers, promotions and services.
We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who, in the unlikely event, acquires all or a substantial portion of CCS’ business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets.
In each of these situations, the recipients of your data may potentially be located in countries whose data protection legislation is different from your country. If you are a resident in any EU member state, for example, you must be aware that the EU authorities do not generally consider that the regulations of non-EU countries ensure an adequate or equivalent level of protection as compared to the EU data protection regulations.
Credit Card Information
Your credit card is charged as you submit your order only for the amount you have approved. Refunds for returned products or unavailable items are processed with the same credit card that was provided in the original order. At no point does CCS possess the full credit card number unless given to it during a manual transaction, such as a phone order. A short period of time after the order is processed, the credit card information is purged from the order.
E-mail Notifications/Opting Out
Customers that place an order may receive notifications of new arrivals, discounts and updated information from our Site. Even if you opt out, you may continue to receive non-marketing e-mail messages from us including, for example, communications regarding your order. You may "Opt Out" of receiving these e-mails by using the "Unsubscribe Me" link at the bottom of every e-mail. Customer Service may also use your e-mail address to contact you about abandoned shopping carts or uncompleted orders. It may be necessary to contact affiliates, business partners or other third parties directly in order to cease receiving communications from those third parties.
Changes/Modifications
You may have access to, review, correct, update, change or delete your account profile information at any time. Simply log into your account, go to your profile, and make the necessary changes. Before providing you with a copy of your Personal Information or correcting, updating or deleting such information, we reserve the right to verify and authenticate your identity and the Personal Information to which you have requested access. Access to or correction, updating or deletion of your personal information may be denied or limited by CCS if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. We will respond to information access requests within 30 days of receipt. If we require additional time to provide access to your information, we will acknowledge receipt of your request within 30 days and promptly supplement our response within the time period required by applicable law.
If you wish to delete or close your account or account profile information altogether, please contact us at customercare@ccs.com. An email will be sent to you to confirm that your Personal Information has been deleted (save for an archival copy which is not accessible by you or third parties on the Internet). The archival copy is retained only for as long as CCS reasonably considers necessary for audit and record purposes. We will retain logs, demographic, indirect, and statistical information about you and keep an archival copy of this information in an anonymized form. If your Personal Information was previously accessed by others using our Site, we are not able to delete the information or copies thereof from their systems.

CCS may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of CCS for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information. To make such a request, please contact us at 1.971.229.0871. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this toll free number.
Children’s Privacy
The Site is not intended for children under 13, and Personal Information from children under 13 will not knowingly be collected. Children’s privacy is a serious matter and parents are encouraged to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times.
Legal Disclosure
We reserve the right to monitor, and disclose to government officials or law enforcement, without your consent, any communications and personally identifiable information, whenever prompted to do so by legal authorities, even when you have requested that your information not be disclosed to third parties. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. The contents of CCS.com are provided "AS IS" and may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current (we strive for 100% accuracy but we are only human). We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions (including after an order has been submitted) and to modify, change or update information (including pricing and/or product code numbers), at any time without prior notice. We may terminate your access to or suspend your right to access all or part of CCS.com, without notice, for any conduct that we believe is in violation of any applicable law or is harmful to the interests of our Site. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time and will post any changes to this policy on their effective date.
