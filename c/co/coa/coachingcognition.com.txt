What Personally Identifiable Information do we collect?
The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience and to fulfill the transactions you undertake here. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this purpose.
Generally, we collect information in three ways. Some information is gathered when you access secure areas within our website. This may include your name, email address, street address, and phone number. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. We may also collect personal information when you contact us with questions or feedback. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence or conversation to better serve you going forward.
Finally, you also will have to provide us with credit card and other payment information necessary to complete a payment from you. We use a third party to process and verify credit cards for billing purposes. This requires us to share your name, credit card number, expiration date and billing address with the credit card processing company. When processing a payment transaction we will also obtain information regarding the amount of the payment and other transaction data. We may transfer or disclose this payment information to a third party only to the extent necessary in order to complete the payment processing.
