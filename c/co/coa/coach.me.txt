Coach.me’s Privacy Policy solely governs the use of information and cookies set by the Services and not by any third-party advertising partners.
Transfers: Coach.me may share data internally with its affiliate companies and may disclose certain information in the event that it is merged, acquired, sold, or some of its assets are acquired. If, in Coach.me’s discretion, your information will be handled in a materially different manner than it was by Coach.me, you may have the opportunity to opt-out of having your information shared with any acquirer.
