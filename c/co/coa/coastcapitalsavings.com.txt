Coast Capital Savings - Privacy Policy
We use your Information to provide you with the best products and services possible. However, we understand that you may not want us to use your Information in certain ways. That's why we give you the choice to opt-out in circumstances where we are able to do so.

We want you to understand how and why we collect, use and disclose your Information. Except in accordance with privacy laws, we will always explain to you the purposes for collecting, using or disclosing your Information either orally or in writing, including through this Policy.
Background
The Information that we collect from you depends on the specific products and services you request. Most of the Information we collect about you is received from you directly. For example, to provide you with products and services, we generally need your name, address, date of birth, and occupation. We also need to ask you for identification and contact information, such as your phone number or email address.
When you apply for credit we may ask you to provide Information about your employment and finances. When you conduct business with us, we keep track of your transactions and activity.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We also collect Information from other persons or organizations, including the following:
government agencies and public registries
credit reporting agencies, other lenders and financial institutions
service providers, agents and other organizations with whom you or we conduct business, or
persons authorized to act on your behalf under a power of attorney or other legal authority.

Third Party Suppliers
We work with third parties who help us with our business or with providing you products and services. Your consent is not required, but when we disclose your Information to third parties, we only give them what is necessary and we take steps to ensure they handle your Information just as carefully as we do.
Information may be sent outside of British Columbia to outside suppliers and other third parties that perform their activities in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, your Information may be subject to valid information requests made by the government agencies in these jurisdictions.
(c) Call Recording and Video Surveillance
When you speak to our representatives on the telephone, your conversations may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, record keeping, investigational or training purposes.

(d) Contests and Promotions
From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways or other promotions. Any Information that you provide to us in these circumstances will be treated in accordance with this Policy, subject to the applicable rules and agreements.
