Personal Information Collected
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information, required by the Website to submit in order to proceed, and by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, account number, and similar information. This Website will not collect any Personal Information about individuals except where it is specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly provided by them.
The Personal Information collected will be used to send you the information you have requested and to provide information that may be useful to you. We may share non-personal, aggregate statistics (group data) about our site visitors’ traffic patterns with partners or other parties; however, we do not sell or share any Personal Information about individual users.
Use and Retention of Personal Information
It is Coats & Clark’s policy to maintain all Personal Information as confidential, regardless of the purpose for which it is submitted, and to use such Personal Information only for the following purposes:
(a) For the specific purpose for which it was volunteered;
(b) To track our visitors’ use of the Website for internal market research; and

It is Coats & Clark’s policy to keep Personal Information only for so long as needed for such purposes.

Given the global nature of both the Internet and Coats & Clark / Coats Ltd., using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information usually involves the transmission of data on an international basis.  By browsing the Website and communicating electronically with us, you agree that we may export Personal Information to one or more of our offices in other countries and process it there in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Although data may be held in countries that do not have strict data privacy laws, we do take steps to maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
Protection of Children's Privacy
