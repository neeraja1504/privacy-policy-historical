Communication & Marketing
If you have registered on COBONE we will update you on our daily deals, news and special offers via e-mail, post or telephone.
We may share your information with COBONE Merchants.

In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with COBONE Merchants. Sharing this Information may allow a COBONE Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a COBONE Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the COBONE Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such COBONE Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with COBONE, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the COBONE Merchant, and the actions of the COBONE Merchant are not in our control.
