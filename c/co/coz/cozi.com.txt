The information we store includes information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination). Some examples of information we collect if you provide it to us include:
Contact Data. We store your first name, household name, e-mail address, and other similar contact data.
We store passwords and similar security information for authentication and account access.
Demographic Data. We store demographic information such as your country.
Payment Data. We store data necessary to process your payment if you provide us with any payment information related to the Service, e.g., if you upgrade to Cozi Gold from our website, we will ask for your credit card information, which will be processed directly by a Company Affiliate or a Service Provider, as each are defined below. We do not store your credit card number. If you upgrade to Cozi Gold from an iOS or Android app, you will pay for the upgrade directly through Apple or Google, respectively, and we will not have access to your credit card information.
Calendar Data. We store any information that you add to your Cozi calendar. In addition, if you link a third party calendar (such as Google) to the Cozi service, we store all data contained in your linked calendar. This includes any information that you add to your Cozi calendar or linked calendars regarding medical or legal appointments, children’s or school events, and other sensitive information.
Profile Data. We store your username, family photo, and other profile data.
Contacts . We store data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you, such as finding your contacts on the Service or inviting your contacts to join the Service, or if you import your phone contacts using our Contacts feature. Such functionality is only intended for United States (“U.S.”) residents. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.
Lists.  We collect any information that you add to your Lists, including sensitive information such as medications, book or video titles, or other personal products, financial, medical, and children’s information, and personal reminders, only while these items are visible to you in your list. We do not store list history.
Birthday Tracker. We store any birthday information that you add to our Birthday Tracker feature.
Journal (Including Photos). We store information you add when you use our Journal feature, including quotes, stories, and images.
Content.  We store the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support.
Resume Data. We store data as necessary to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, such as your employment history, transcript, writing samples, and references.
You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.
Information Collected Automatically.
We automatically collect information from and about your use of the Service and the devices you use to access the Service. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our Service, and information about the advertisements you view and the links you click on. Your devices (depending on your settings) may also transmit location information and/or an advertising identifier to the Service. Some examples of information we collect include the following:
Service Use Data. We collect data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the e-mails from us and advertisements you view, the products you purchase from us, the time of day you browse, your referring and exiting pages, and other similar information.
Device Connectivity and Configuration Data. We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and other similar information. This data may also include IP address, MAC address, device advertising Id (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
Location Data. If you have enabled location services, we collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).
We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“ Tracking Technologies ”), including the following:
Log Files. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. Data in log files is not personally identifiable.
Cookies. A cookie is a small data file stored on your device that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.
Pixels. A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
Device Fingerprinting. Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.
App Technologies. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality.
Location-Identifying Technologies. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.
Voice Processing Technologies. Voice processing technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device to effectuate an instruction or request by you. We only maintain the audio long enough to complete your instruction or request and then immediately delete it. We may use non-audio data associated with the collection for additional purposes such as data analytics and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.
For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the sections entitled “Third Parties” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Information from Other Sources.
We also obtain information about you from other third party sources. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with information we have collected about you through the Service, we will treat the combined information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources vary over time, but have included:
Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.
Social networks when you reference our Service or grant permission to Cozi to access your data on one or more of these services.

The new company would be required to protect all the information that Cozi has collected from its users under the same terms of this Privacy Policy.

Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. For information on your rights and choices regarding how we share your information, please see the section entitled “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Public Information
Certain areas of the Service, such as the Journal and Recipe Box, are designed to help you share information with the world. If you make information public through our Service, other people will have access to it. Please think carefully before making information public as you are solely responsible for any information you make public. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information; however, California residents and data subjects in Europe have additional rights as set forth in “Your Rights and Choices” below.
Third Parties
Third Party Services.
Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (“Third Party Services”). Cozi does not have control over the privacy policies of advertisers or other third-party websites. These Third Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
Third Party Features.
We may allow you to connect our Service to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“ Third Party Features ”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:
Liking and Sharing.  We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service or visit our Service while logged in to that Third Party Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Service and be able to associate that information with information the Third Party Service already has about you.
Brand Pages. We may offer our content on social networks such as a Facebook and Twitter. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Cozi in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.
Voice-Activated Skills. We may offer skills through Alexa and other voice-activated platforms, and use the voice processing and other technologies discussed in the section entitled “Information Collected Automatically” above. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our skills is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Platform Linking. We may offer you the ability to link your Cozi account to a Third Party Service in order to retrieve certain data about your account on that Service. For example, if you link your Cozi account to your Google calendar, the linking may allow us to obtain information such as your username, e-mail address, and calendar content. For more information about how these platforms handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.
Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.
If you are a Cozi Gold subscriber, your experience on the Cozi app will be ad-free.
Our Service contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties, such as Google Doubleclick for Publishers, to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“ Interest-based Advertising ”).
We may serve ads on Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, which are targeted to reach people (or similar people) on those services that have visited our Service or that are also identified in one of more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by matching common factors between our data and the data of Third Party Services. When we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Services’ failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.

This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising.

To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You can learn more about your EU Online Choices here. Please note that if you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving online behavioral advertising to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).

How does Cozi protect my children’s information?
Cozi will never knowingly request information or private content from anyone under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“ COPPA ”) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. In order to register and create a Cozi account you must be 18 years of age or older. You may, at any time, direct Cozi to delete all identifiable information regarding you or your family that you have provided or that has been collected from your family. To do so, please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information below in the section entitled “Contact Us.” However, if you do any of the foregoing, you and your family will not be able to use the Cozi account or our Services. If you are a parent or guardian and believe Cozi has collected information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below, and we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
How does Cozi maintain security?
Cozi uses industry standard methods of securing user information and data. Examples of our security measures include, where appropriate, firewalls, virtual private networks, encryption, and anonymization. We also maintain strict limits on who at Cozi and at our parent corporation Meredith Corporation can access the information databases that contain your information. Since there is no such thing as perfect security over the Internet, we cannot guarantee 100% security. However, in the unlikely case of a security breach on our databases, we will take immediate steps to resolve the problem swiftly and effectively.
What happens if I want to forward my Cozi information to a friend?
If you use one of the Cozi features designed to allow you to voluntarily forward or share your information or content with family or friends outside of your secure account, we will forward or share access to such content from your account to your friend’s email address as you provided it to us. Such email address may be stored by Cozi for your future use but will not be used by Cozi to initiate any emails. By sharing your content, you automatically limit Cozi’s ability to keep your content private. We recommend that you do this only with trusted friends and family.
Will there be changes and updates to this Privacy Policy?
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to stay informed of any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy. If you continue to use our Services after we make changes to the Privacy Policy, you agree to the changes. If the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice to your e-mail address.
