ColorFXweb.com uses this personal information to aid in presenting its customers with a better interactive experience and to facilitate the customer’s ability to make purchases and orders from the ColorFXweb.com website. To register for a login user ID, your name, address, email address, billing information, and business profile are requested.

Our practice is to require our suppliers and vendors to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with this policy and our requirements.
If necessary, ColorFXweb.com obtains consumer information from third-party providers in order to improve the accuracy of our customer database and to increase our understanding of our customers or to identify potential customers.
