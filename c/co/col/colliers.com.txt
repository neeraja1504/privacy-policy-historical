However, we will never intentionally provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals not listed above (collectively "Third Parties") without your express permission to do so. We will notify you at the time of such data collection or transfer if your Personal Information is to be shared with a Third Party and you will always have the option of not permitting such sharing.
The following describes how we are using the information that you provide to us.
1. What Personal Information does Colliers.com collect from you?

During the on-line registration process, for example, Colliers.com may ask for your name, email address, telephone number, postal code, occupation, industry information and professional interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to assist you with your real estate needs.

3. How does Colliers.com use Personal Information?
Colliers.com's primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalized services, interactive communications, online transactions and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide such services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, Colliers.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. Colliers.com does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this in order to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. CIPC may share aggregated user data with advertisers or business partners. However, CIPC will never intentionally provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals without your permission to do so and will take all reasonable steps to protect such Personal Information from perpetrators of fraud or internet piracy.
4. Who is collecting information?
When you are on a Colliers.com site and are asked for Personal Information, you are sharing that information with Colliers.com alone unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from Third Parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these Third Parties, Colliers.com will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them.
HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT AS PART OF ITS PRIVACY POLICY CIPC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH WE, IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IF SUCH INFORMATION MAY CREATE A LIABILITY FOR US OR MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE ALL OR PART OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO US BY OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER SUPPLIERS.
6. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?
