Bluegreen’s Internet Privacy Statement

We may also request information regarding your vacation preferences including destinations, seasons of interest, accommodations and length of stay, as well as income level and whether you have toured a Bluegreen property before.

C. Information we collect using technology
We use technology to collect information in order to make your experience at our websites more enjoyable, and so that we can provide you with enhanced products and services. For example, we may automatically track and collect your IP address, domain server, the type of web browser and computer operating system you are using, and we may use web beacons and cookies to: (i) understand the frequency with which you visit our websites, (ii) track and understand the manner in which you are using our web sites, (iii) customize content to enhance your visit and the services we provide on our websites, (iv) offer you targeted messages, advertisements and offers; (v) send you targeted emails if you have provided us with your email address, and (vi) if you have registered for Bluegreen Online Services, to tailor your personal preferences.
Cookies are bits of data that a web site sends to your computer’s web browser and operating system. They are stored on your computer hard drive to identify you or your preferences when you return to that web site. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you’ll return to a specific website with the same settings you used on a previous visit. There are two types of cookies. Temporary cookies are designed to stay on your computer only while you are visiting our websites. Non-expiring cookies are placed on the hard drive in your computer and allow us to collect information such as: date and time of visits, time spent on the website, and pages viewed while on the website. We may place both temporary and non-expiring cookies on your computer. Cookies can also store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, home or work address or telephone number. You can choose whether to accept or deny cookies by changing the privacy settings on your web browser. In fact, your web browser’s privacy settings can be configured to specify how you want the web browser to handle cookies from individual websites or all websites. Please keep in mind that most computers are initially configured to accept cookies. Also note that if you turn cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.
The pages of our websites contain images (called a “single-pixel gif” or “web beacons”) that allow our third party secure provider and us to count page views or to collect other anonymous data. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, usually 1 by 1 pixel in size, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on “View” and then on “Source”. Web beacons are small in order to minimize both their display and their loading time. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our website visitors; they are merely the technique we use to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about the usage of our websites.
For tracking purposes, we use web beacons on our websites along with other technical methods. We may also use these technical methods in emails that we send to track whether the emails have been opened or if links contained therein have been clicked. We also employ a third party service that collects data remotely through the use of web beacons. This service then returns the completely anonymous data to us as site traffic reports.
D. Information we collect from third parties
We may supplement, improve and/or enhance personally identifiable information that we collect from you with other information that we obtain from third parties and our affiliates. In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet our customers or users of our web sites. Moreover, when we associate information that we obtain from third parties or affiliates with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Statement, we will treat the acquired information the same as the information that we collected ourselves, and, except as permitted by this Privacy Statement, we will not share the information with third parties.
How we secure your information
Bluegreen uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. For example, when you enter a password to access a Bluegreen Online Services Account, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to present secure pages to protect that information. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that’s transferred over the SSL connection. Most web browsers, including Internet Explorer, support SSL and many websites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with https instead of http. You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your web browser window. For example, in Internet Explorer you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you’re using. Be sure to download and use the latest version of a web browser. Beta versions of web browsers are not recommended.
In addition we use a third party payment gateway service that enables us to authorize, settle and manage credit cards safely and securely via a 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Internet Protocol (IP) connection.
How we use and share your information
A. We may share your information with our affiliates
We may share your information, in whole or in part, with our affiliates, i.e. the companies that are controlled by Bluegreen, in order to send you promotional materials about our products and services.
B. We may share your information with third party service providers
We may share your information, in whole or in part, with the following third party service providers: (i) companies that provide marketing and sales services on our behalf, (ii) companies that process and service your accounts, and (iii) companies that help us protect and secure your information and the confidentiality of our records. Occasionally, we may partner with other companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, products and services and may share your information with our co-sponsor. For example, we may co-sponsor a sweepstakes on our site with other companies, or we may provide prizes for sweepstakes sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes, we may share your information with the co-sponsor or third party sponsor. All of these third party service providers have contractual obligations with us to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Additionally, these third party service providers are only permitted to use your information for the purposes specified by the sweepstakes or promotion as specified by us or our affiliates, or as allowed by law.
C. We may disclose your information to non-affiliated third parties
We may disclose your information, in whole or in part, to the following types of non-affiliated third parties: (i) companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements; (ii) non-financial organizations, such as direct marketing companies and consumer reporting agencies, (iii) financial service providers, such as companies engaged in banking, credit card business and consumer finance, and (iv) others, such as non-profit organizations.
D. Other circumstances in which we may share your information
We may share your information when you specifically request it or give us permission to do so. We may also share your information when we suspect criminal or fraudulent activity, and when we are required by law such as when we receive a subpoena or a court order. We may also share your information in the event that we sell a particular line of business or function.
Requesting to not have your personal information shared with non-affiliated third parties
You may direct us to limit the disclosure of personal information about you that we share with non-affiliated third parties. If you elect this opt-out choice, we will not disclose your information to those non-affiliated third parties set forth in paragraph 4.C., however, we may still disclose your personal information to third parties: (i) that perform marketing services on our behalf; and (ii) as permitted by law, such as to service providers, to protect against fraud, and to protect the security or confidentiality of our records.

Use and participation by minors
All of our promotions and website applications require the entrant and user to be 18 or over, therefore we do not knowingly accept personal information from minors.

How we safeguard public or shared information
At Bluegreen, we will strive to keep all your information up to date, and to guard your privacy by continuously evaluating the enforcement and nature of our policies. There are currently no areas of the bluegreenonline.com website where any type of personal data would be visible to the public without first obtaining written permission and appropriate releases prior to use and posting (i.e. prior sweepstakes’ winners, employee or owner testimonials, etc.)
How we notify you of changes to this Privacy Statement
