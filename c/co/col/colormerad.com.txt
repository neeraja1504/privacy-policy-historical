You can choose to opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features we use through Google Ad Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (such as the National Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) consumer opt-out).
What do we use your information for?
Any of the information collected may be used to improve our website, improve customer service, to process transactions, to send periodic emails with information about The Color Me Rad race, to administer a contest, survey, promotion of other racing events or other site features.
