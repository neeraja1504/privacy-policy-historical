Online Identification Tools:
Similar to many other website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose potential problems with our server and provide you with a better online-shopping experience. We use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather Online Information.
We also use web beacons to personalize your experience of the Service and to generate information about Service traffic and trends. Web beacons collect Online Information, such as your IP address and the type of browser that you use. Web beacons may be used alone or in conjunction with cookies; when web beacons are used with cookies, they may link Online Information to other Personal Information that you have provided to us. Web beacons are not typically visible to you.
We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes such as personalizing the Service. We collect this type of information to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us. A cookie is a small file stored by your Internet browser on your computer. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your account or to personalize the content that you see. Please note that we do not and cannot use cookies to gather other information that may be stored on your hard drive.
We may use Google Analytics or other analytical tools provided by third parties. Third-party advertising management partners may help us display tailored content to our customers’ interests and serve interest-based advertising on our behalf. Renegade Furniture Group and our advertising management partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other tools to collect Online Information about your activities on the Service, to deliver advertising on the Service, or elsewhere on the Internet based upon your interests that may be more relevant to you and to measure effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the Service.

(For example, https://preferences.boomtrain.com/preferences/3858/users? email=< INSERT YOUR EMAIL >.)

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals: **
Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") that signals to websites that a user does not want his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many digital service operators, including Renegade Furniture Group** , do not recognize or respond to DNT signals.
**Third Party Features: **
The Service also may include an activity feed, social media buttons and widgets, such as the Pinterest or Facebook "Like" button or the "Share” button. These features may collect and display your Personal Information, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Please not that these features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Service and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of the third party that provides the feature.

Information Security
We have instituted commercially reasonable safeguards to help ensure that information collected is secure. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who work with us to make the Site available to you agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve you and to honor your preferences about contacts you receive.
When you send or otherwise transmit your sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to or though the Sites, your sensitive information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to check the URL or address of the page. These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with "https://" instead of "http://". Please understand, however, despite these safeguards and our efforts, that it may be still possible for third parties to access information. Without limiting the terms of our Terms of Use and this Policy, you understand that we do not guarantee that your use of the Site and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.
