Welcome to ColorWare
ColorWare was founded on the idea that electronic devices could be more appealing than the standard colors offered by the original manufacturer. ColorWare products are creative and fashionable, giving their customers something unique that sets them apart from all the rest.
ColorWare is the only company in the world where you can create your own bespoke electronic device. The range of products spans from headphones to computers, portable PC’s, phones and gaming consoles.
At ColorWare, quality control is rigorous. Great care is taken throughout every step of the process to ensure the highest level of quality from start to finish. Each ColorWare product is disassembled by hand from the original manufacturer. Once the product is disassembled, all parts are compartmentalized. Then the product is hand sprayed with a base coat. Once painted, It is baked at a low temperature to ensure the item dries thoroughly and evenly. Finally, the product is given an X2 coating that is also hand sprayed. This coating is a proprietary, scratch resistant, liquid plastic. The product is again baked, then polished and detailed and sent back to the production area for reassembly.
Not only is the process durable and unique, but each step is completed at the ColorWare facility in Winona, Minnesota.

Our History
The idea of creating custom-made, on-demand electronic devices was developed in 1998 by CEO Justin Cisewski. With the help of his family members, the process of customizing different consumer electronics was perfected, and in 2000, ColorWare was founded.
From their humble beginnings, the Cisewski family began testing different paint finishes on computers and cellphones, while working out of a small warehouse. They focused all their attention on a few select products so they could perfect each step, from disassembly to painting and reassembly. Because the business was based on high quality customization standards, customers knew they could trust ColorWare and the business began to grow exponentially.
In 2000, ColorWare contacted Alienware and began painting gaming consoles and PC’s for them. Before long the Minnesota-based company moved to Miami, Florida to work with Alienware. The partnership lasted about two years before the Cisewski family decided to take their business back home to Minnesota. The Cisewski’s believed wholeheartedly in their business and they wanted to be free to experiment with other product offerings, paint coatings, and art applications.
In Minnesota, ColorWare began to add new products, new colors, and new departments to their company. They landed prominent retail promotions with Target and Sam Goody. Soon, ColorWare was a recognized name; checking in at number 108 on the list for fastest growing companies in Inc. 500.
In 2008, a machine shop was added to the business. The machine shop created fixtures to support the customization process. And later, ColorWare began creating original custom products including, the Grip for iPad, and the Wedge, a stand for tablet PC’s.
In 2012, ColorWare quadrupled the size of their state-of-the-art paint facility. A clean room was also constructed to provide up-to-date art application processes. Currently, ColorWare provides colorization for more than 30 products and continues to build a ColorWare custom line of products uniquely their own.

X2 Coating
The X2 coating is the final step in our proprietary coatings process. It is a layer of clear coat, or urethane that protects the product from the environment. This coating is much like the finish on an automobile, impervious to minor scratches, water, and UV rays from the sun.
To achieve this highly durable finish, the X2 coating is applied similarly to the primer and base coat process. The urethane is hand sprayed in a controlled environment providing healthy, clean air with a full downdraft ventilation system in each booth. The clear coat, like the paint, is cured before assembly.
