We may share all categories of your personal information to selected outside companies, either by selling it or otherwise transferring it, to advertisers and other business partners that assist us in providing you with meaningful and relevant Services (each, collectively an “Advertiser”). Our Advertisers include realtors, loan providers and other complementary service companies, schools, work places, and social media platforms such as Facebook. The sharing of your personal information with these Advertisers is conducted in accordance with the contact preferences that you set when you create your user profile, or when you express an interest in any content displayed on our Site, or when you enter a response to any affirmative authorization that you provide by typing it in a space provided or clicking on an icon designed to show your interest in an item on the web page or in the app.  In certain cases, we may ask on behalf of an Advertiser that you have expressed an interest in for your express written consent to receive marketing autodialed or pre-recorded calls or text messages at a phone number you designate. Your consent to such requests is not required as a condition for use of the Niche Services and you can opt out from such calls or texts at any time by following the instructions in such calls or text messages, or by contacting the particular Advertiser directly. Standard message and data rates may apply to calls or texts based on your plan.
In addition, any personal information you share publicly through our Site may be indexed through third party search engines, such as Google or Bing. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your information, including any outdated information. You acknowledge that personal information that you submit when you participate in an opinion survey or user review, a blog or any online message board that we provide through our Site or Services may be available, via the Internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such personal information by others, nor can we ensure it is deleted if you later ask us to delete your personal information as provided for in this Policy.
B. Third party processors:

These Processors need access to and use of your personal information, and include third parties to provide us with technical support, to give us additional personal data about you, and to perform analytics and other work that we may need to outsource. These Processors are bound by law and/or contract to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.  They only process your personal information to provide requested services for us, and only act on our documented instructions. In addition, we use certain third party Processors, such as Google’s reCAPTCHA service, to validate login credentials of individuals and to frustrate bots; in these cases, your privacy rights are determined by the Processor’s privacy policy.
We also share all categories of your personal information with other business partners that perform certain functions for us (“Business Partners”).  These Business Partners are themselves responsible to determine the purposes and/or means of the processing your personal information and for the lawfulness of that processing.  They include insurance companies, financial institutions, and other professional advisors.

E. As required by law or legitimate business interest **:  **
In addition, we may disclose any or all categories of your personal information where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person. Likewise, we may disclose all such categories of your personal information to our professional advisers as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. Further, we may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger or similar transaction involving sale or transfer of some or all of our business or assets. If another company acquires our company or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
