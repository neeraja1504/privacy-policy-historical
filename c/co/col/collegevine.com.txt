Privacy Policy | CollegeVine
This Privacy Policy applies to web sites operated by Canopy Education, Inc., dba CollegeVine (“CollegeVine”), including www.collegevine.com, www.app.collegevine.com, and www.blog.collegevine.com (together the “CollegeVine Sites”). By visiting or using the CollegeVine Sites, and any other linked pages, features, content, or any other services we offer from time to time in connection therewith, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
1. General Policy Statement
CollegeVine respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Our services require us to collect detailed personal information from you. This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of this personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using the CollegeVine Sites and services and explains our information collection and sharing practices, as well as the choices you can make to limit our sharing your information.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. Information you choose to disclose publicly on the CollegeVine Sites (i.e., information which is viewable to other users) will not be considered Personal Information.
In general, we use this Personal Information to deliver personalized guidance services to our users. We also share your Personal Information with vendors (for example, marketing automation vendors or hosting providers) as needed to assist CollegeVine with business operations, but in such instances, these vendors are contractually required to keep your information confidential.
We may also use information about how you interact with the CollegeVine Sites to generate aggregated data and insights that may also be shared with our partners. We take steps to ensure that this data is always anonymous and not identifiable in any way.
2. Information We Collect
CollegeVine collects and stores information you provide to us. For example, during the registration process, we collect Personal Information such as your name, username, email address, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third-party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you are consenting to have the information in those accounts (“Third-Party Account Information”) transmitted into your account with us, and that Third-Party Account Information is covered by this Privacy Policy. We may also collect other Personal Information you provide to us through your use of our services, such address, phone number, date of birth, financial information, and other academic and demographic variables relevant to the college selection/admission process.
CollegeVine does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the CollegeVine Sites or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to CollegeVine or on the CollegeVine Sites. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@collegevine.com.
Whenever you interact with the CollegeVine Sites, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. Information gathered through cookies and our web server logs may include the date and time of visits, your IP address, the pages viewed, time spent at our CollegeVine Site, and the web sites visited just before and just after a CollegeVine Site. This information may be appended to your profile information to provide you with better service and information and may be shared with partners as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

CollegeVine will release your personal information if required by law, for example, if we receive a subpoena or otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires us to release your information.
If CollegeVine sells any part of its business, CollegeVine may transfer your information to its successor, regardless of your opt-out status.

7. California Online Privacy Protection Act("CALOPPA") Disclosures Required By 2013 Amendment
Information provided in this Section 7 pursuant to CalOPPA is in addition to the disclosures contained in other sections of this Privacy Policy, which also address some CalOPPA requirements.
Do Not Track ("DNT") Signals - Web browsers offer you an option to send "Do Not Track" signals to web sites you visit. CollegeVine Sites may use third-party ad servers, retargeting services and web analytics systems, such as Google, to provide advertising on our sites, analyze aggregate web usage statistics and provide us the ability to display advertisements to you when you have left our site. CollegeVine does not respond to DNT Signals as it does not track you when you leave a CollegeVine Site. CollegeVine's third party service providers, who provide ad serving, retargeting services and web analytics services to CollegeVine, may not respond to DNT signals. If a user comes to a CollegeVine Site directly with a DNT signal enabled on such user's browser, CollegeVine does not look for the DNT signal or respond to it.
Third Party Collection of Personally Identifiable Information - Other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, we generally do not allow third parties to collect your personally identifiable information provided on the CollegeVine Sites. In some cases, however, our third-party service providers may collect information through the CollegeVine Site in order to assist CollegeVine in operating its web sites and services. Section 3 of this Privacy Policy contains additional information on how we share your information with third party service providers.
