We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
HOW YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION
If you have registered with the CouponAlert Site, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.
If you have registered with the CouponAlert Site you also may choose to close your account at any time by clicking Here. You will need to be signed into the member account that you would like to cancel. If you are not currently signed into an account, you will be prompted to so do during the cancellation process.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your inability to use or access certain features of the CouponAlert Site or CouponAlert Services, purchase products or services, participate in a promotion, ask a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.

We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
