Privacy Policy - CourtRecords.org
Effective: July 14, 2015
This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the types of information gathered by CourtRecords ("we" or "us") when you use CourtRecords.org (the "Site"), how we use and safeguard that information, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information.
Please note: if you are reviewing or accessing CourtRecords’ services via a third party website not under our control (such as an affiliate website), that website may have its own privacy policy. Please be sure to review that third party’s privacy policy, as its terms may differ from ours.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
When you use the Site, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us.
Log Files
We may automatically and through third-party tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics) gather certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of our websites and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, solely to improve the quality of the Site. Out of respect for your privacy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Cookies
We use both session ID cookies and tracking cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to use the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use tracking cookies to better understand how you use the Site, and to enhance your user experience. A tracking cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You are free to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our offerings. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while using the Site.

We will disclose information collected from and about you to the following entities for the following purposes: (1) to our related companies, service providers and suppliers, to enable them to fulfill a product or service request or to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (2) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms of Service or of our rights or the rights of any third party; and (3) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.
We may also sell, rent or lease your personal information to our marketing partners, advertisers or other third parties. If you would prefer that we not share your personal information with such third parties, please contact us.
In order to make the Site as useful as possible to all users, we may display comments you make on a record, along with the name you have associated with your comment, on the Site. We do not associate your comments with your personally identifiable information unless you choose to include your name with your comment. However, please be advised that if you choose to submit a comment, it will be publicly displayed on the Site.

In the event the Site goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any personally identifiable information we have on record will likely be among the assets transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any subsequent updated versions.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We employ encryption and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Whenever you provide us or our partners with sensitive or confidential information, we or our partners will take commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. However, please be advised that while we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches from ever occurring.
