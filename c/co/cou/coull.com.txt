-          any personal details you knowingly provide to (for example upon  registration), such as names, addresses, bank details, email details and telephone numbers;
-          the IP address of your device(s) - this is a string of numbers unique to your device(s) that is recorded by our web server when you request any page or component on the Service. This is used to monitor your use of the Service;

We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may use your information:

-     to send you emails, service messages and otherwise communicate with you regarding the Service and your account;

We will not sell or share your information with a third party (other than any data processors acting on our behalf) unless you consent to this.
What do we do on the websites you have registered with the Service?
JavaScript
Once you start using the Service on one of your websites, and you have embedded our code, a JavaScript file will be downloaded to the devices of visitors to your websites ( Visitors ) when they view the website. This JavaScript file will do the following:
For YouTube videos:
-          Change the domain name for each YouTube video from YouTube.com to Coull.com
For videos of all other video players that we are currently integrated with:
-          There is no change in domain name for the video. Instead when the visitor plays a video it will request additional information from the Coull service.
When a visitor plays a video that contains an advertiser’s link (a Vidlink) then cookies may be dropped.  Depending on the type of Vidlink, a cookie may be dropped when a video is played or when a Vidlink is clicked.  These cookies:
-          Collect and store information about the Vidlinks that users click on, and report on other outbound clicks for Publisher reports
-          Collect and store information about videos on Publisher Sites, so we can find a suitable product/Merchant link to add to that video
-          Record anonymous information about the pages, links and Merchants visited by Users across our Publisher network. This will be used to optimise the service we provide, to deliver reporting and analytics to Publishers, and so that the links we create/monetize are to products and Merchants that Users prefer.
Cookies
Below are details of the cookies that may be set on a publisher website to enable us to manage your account:

In addition, cookies may be dropped when a user visits a video which contains Coull content.  These are described below in the Visitors section.
Do you need to update your website privacy policies or make other disclosures if you use the Service?
It is important that your website(s) make clear to Visitors that you are engaged in performance marketing through our Service. In order to promote transparent use of the Service, you therefore need to update your privacy policy(ies), 'About Us' or other relevant aspect or text of your website(s) to include an appropriate disclosure statement about your use of our Service. The standard minimum disclosure that we require is as follows, but in signing up to be a publisher you have also agreed that this may change and/or there may be other disclosure requirements.
' We use performance marketing services on this website which are provided by our partner Coull. Coull serves the marketing links that that you see displayed in the videos on this site. As part of these services, this site allows cookies and other technologies to be placed on your browser by Coull and its partners. To find out more about what cookies Coull and its partners use, what information they collect, how they use that information, what they do to protect that information, and your choices regarding the collection and use of that information (including opting out of this) please visit [insert link to 'Visitor' section below] '
Indemnity
A Publisher shall indemnify and keep fully indemnified Coull at all times from all liabilities, costs, (including legal costs on an indemnity basis), expenses, damages and losses including any direct, indirect and consequential loss, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and reasonable costs and expenses suffered or incurred by Coull arising from any breach of this privacy policy by that Publisher.
D. VISITORS
If you are a visitor to a publisher website that uses our Service ( Visitor ), this section explains how the Service operates and how your information is collected, stored and used by us and our partners.
What is the Service?
Our Service helps website publishers to earn commission revenue. The Service embeds links within the videos available on those publishers' websites. If you click on those links and subsequently visit a third party website, and/or then buy something from that website, we pay the publisher a commission for this. The Service in no way makes what you buy more expensive though.
What information do we collect about Visitors and what do we do with it?
We do not intentionally capture personal information about you such as your name, address etc.
We do collect and store your IP address however, from which we can work out your approximate location.  Your IP address is a string of numbers unique to your device(s) that is recorded by our web server. We need these IP addresses to ensure the links we show you are relevant to where you live. We do not use IP addresses to specifically identify any individuals or identify exactly where you live however.
We also store information about the device(s) visitors use to access the internet, such as the browser type, browser version, and type of device used. This helps us ensure we can diagnose and fix browser compatibility issues more swiftly, and optimise the Service to suit preferred browsing environments.
As part of the information available in standard web serving logs, we also store information about the website page (if any) from where a visitor came to a publisher website.  We do not know who a visitor is however or make any attempt to try and identify them. We also do not combine any information we store with outside sources to find out anything personal or identifiable about a visitor. All we know is that these actions were done by an anonymous individual, and we use this to try and serve that individual relevant and useful links on that publisher website and other sites within our publisher network.
We also track your browsing habits using cookies (see below for more information about this).
Cookies

Performance cookies
We use cookies to collect information we need to optimise the links provided as part of the Service, and to improve the service we provide to Visitors.
Contextual and behavioral advertising cookies
We aim to provide visitors with relevant and useful links to products in which they are likely to be interested in. To try and achieve this we use cookies. Some of these cookies allow us to serve advertising links which are relevant to the context of the publisher website you are visiting. Other advertising cookies also track your browsing habits so that we can show you links which we hope are relevant to your interests. These advertising cookies use information about your web browsing activity to group you with other visitors who have similar interests and show you links based upon those interests. For example, these cookies may remember that you viewed website pages relating to travel and that you viewed similar content on another website. Based on this, we can place cookies on your browser to enable us to show you links relating to travel whilst you are on a publisher website.
Referral tracking
In order for Service to work, Visitors are assigned an anonymous and unique ID number. When a Visitor clicks on one of our advertising links, we attach the Visitor's ID as the Visitor passes to the appropriate affiliate network so it can track whether that Visitor subsequently makes a purchase. The affiliate networks that we work with also use their own cookies to track if a purchase has been made, as most will only pay publishers for successful referrals.  We do not have control over or access to these cookies however and they are dropped by the affiliate networks via the publisher websites.
Disabling and deleting cookies
You can disable and/or delete all types of cookies by using your browser settings. Cookies are generally easy to disable and/or delete but how you do so varies from browser to browser. The "help" function within your browser should tell you how to do it. The best way may be to close your browser and then search for "cookie folder" or "cookie manager" or simply "cookie". Please also visit www.allaboutcookies.org for more information about cookies and how to disable them.
Please be aware though that if you do disable any Service cookies, the links provided as part of the Service may no longer work properly.
