Questions asked are purely for the internal marketing, editorial creation and product planning use of CouplesCompany.com. Though detailed, this information allows us to decided what products to carry, what price ranges will suit our membership, where to look for special offers for our members, plus the direction of our editorial, courses and other service offerings. For auditing purposes, it substantiates our membership and visitor numbers. It also allows us to prevent children from accessing content not suited to their age.

Co-branded Relationships and Strategic Partners
Users may experience CouplesCompany.com within a co-branded environment alongside one of our partners. These companies are strategic partners. Co-branded pages are recognizable by two methods. 1) By the presence of a "frame" either at the top the page and/or when both companies' brand logos are presented together on the page. 2) By a separate browse window opening to allow access to the partners site without leaving Couples Company. In such situations, individual user information may be shared only between our two companies in an effort to better understand and meet our customers' needs. An example of this would be your region of the country or zip code. Should you have additional privacy concerns, please also refer to the privacy policy of our partner from whose site you visited prior to arriving at CouplesCompany.com.   TOP
