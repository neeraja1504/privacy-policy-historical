Privacy Policy
GDPR wants plain speak on this, so here is my “plain speak”:
Summation: assume your IP is being tracked online. Always. If you sign up for a newsletter, you are giving people access to your email address and IP address. Why? This “free” content (social media, blogs, news sites, sports sites, etc) is not actually free. It costs money to run a website. Sooooo since the content is “free to you” (generic you) ads pay the bills. Remember: if you are not paying for the product, you are the product.
Now, with that in mind, here is more information on  Ann’s Entitled Life  data collection.
