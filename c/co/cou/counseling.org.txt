Privacy Policy
The American Counseling Association (ACA) respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its Web sites (the “Sites”) or use our mobile applications (each an “App”). The Sites and Apps are collectively the “Services.” ACA strongly believes that if electronic commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, ACA has implemented the following policy.
ACA is located in the United States and these are U.S.-based websites. By using these Sites or the Services, you agree to the data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices described in this privacy policy. ****
POLICY CHANGES
If there are material changes to our privacy policies, we will notify you by posting the updated policy on our sites, and for registered users, by sending an email. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review this page frequently for any changes. Amendments to this privacy policy will be effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any amended or revised privacy policy by your continued use of our services or the sites.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES ACA COLLECT?
In some countries, including in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws:
Most data ACA collects is used only to help us better serve our members. It is our general policy to collect and store only personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide.
We collect information from you when you choose to provide it to us.  This may include when you submit a membership application or otherwise join ACA, request information from us, register for a conference or other event, purchase a product, create an account with us, sign up for newsletters or our email lists, use our Services, submit a rating or review, participate in a survey or promotion, or otherwise contact us.
The information we collect may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, geolocation information, photos or videos, user name and, if you are an ACA customer or member, credit/debit card number or other financial information. If you use a third party service to login, link to us, or communicate with us (such as a social network or third party video chat), we may receive certain information about you from the third party based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party services
From General Users.  ACA does not automatically collect any personal information from users browsing its websites. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page -- are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.
From ACA's Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Customers.  To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on counseling.org, members and other users are asked to register and provide some limited information. ACA and its partners may collect IP address and other specific non-personally identifying information for targeted or interest-based communications. This information is submitted voluntarily. ACA asks users to provide their name, organization name, business phone, and email. Similar information may be submitted to ACA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions, and contest registrations. Additionally, for some e-mails sent in HTML format by ACA to its members through its communities (ACA Connect) and electronic newsletters, ACA, or our authorized service providers, will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that email. For those emails, ACA will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: email address of a user, the date and time of the user’s “click,” a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number, and destination page. ACA only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members.
What About Information About Children?  Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of thirteen.
HOW DOES ACA USE DATA COLLECTED?
ACA uses information voluntarily submitted by members and other customers in the following ways:
ACA Member Services and Products.  Generally, ACA and its direct, branches, divisions and affiliates use data collected to improve its own web content; to respond to visitors’ interests, needs and preferences; and to develop new products and services.
Disclosures to Third Parties.  ACA also makes member contact information available through the ACA Connect Membership Directory to other members using its websites and to those who register for its conferences. On occasion, ACA may also provide limited data to third parties that offer products and services. These limited data include names, job titles, companies, business addresses, and email addresses, but do not include business phone or fax numbers. Users may contact ACA by email or phone at 703-823-9800 to express their preferences if they determine later that they do not wish to have the information shared. Please include “Web Privacy Policy Question or Comment” in the subject line.
Credit Card Account Information.  When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, ACA submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate third-party payment vendors for the limited purpose of processing your payment. ACA does not otherwise disclose your credit card information.
Compliance with Law.  We may provide access to your information, including personal information, when legally required to do so, to cooperate with legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our websites, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of these websites or the public.
