How Do We Collect Information?
CouponWinner.com collects the personal information you provide when you opt to receive our e-mail newsletter, follow us on social media, share coupons, or enter a promotional giveaway. This information may include your name, e-mail address, or other disclosures that can be used to identify you or any third party member of whom you share information.
Email Newsletter – Our site is completely free to use without submitting personal information. However, you will be required to submit your e-mail address if you would like to receive our email newsletter. An auto-generated e-mail will then be sent to your inbox asking to confirm your subscription. The information submitted therein will not be shared with any third party, including affiliates, partners, parent companies or subsidiaries for marketing purposes. You may cease to receive e-mail newsletters by clicking the unsubscribe link located in the e-mail newsletter.
Share Coupon – Users can send coupons to others by using the “Share Coupon” function underneath the brand logo on the coupon. Users will be asked to offer their name and the e-mail address(es) of those they wish to send the coupons to. A one-time e-mail will be sent to the recipient, and he/she will never receive any other coupon, notification or general information in the future.
Social Media Networking – We use Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest, and YouTube to further connect with our users. You may adjust the privacy settings on your social media platform or application and/or manage our interactivity or permissions through your own social media account to manage the information you share with us. We routinely host giveaways via social media and by purpose of entry, you may be asked to provide your name. This is solely for the purpose of participation.
Cookies – We utilize technology commonly referred to as “cookies” to collect information about how our website is being used. We use cookies to identify which pages are being visited and how often.
