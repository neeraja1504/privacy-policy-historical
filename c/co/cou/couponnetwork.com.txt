This information may include purchase preferences.
In addition, we gather information about you that is automatically collected by our web server, such as your IP address and domain name. Your browser also provides us the web site you come from (known as the referring URL), the type of browser and computer you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.
COOKIES
Cookies and log files are technologies used by the Sites to identify a user as he/she moves through our Sites. Your browser allows us to place some information (session based IDs and/or persistent cookies) on your computer’s hard drive that identifies the computer you are using. We may use cookies to personalize our Sites and to track your usage across other sites. Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. Pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, are similar in function to a cookie. But because of their insignificant size, it is not visible; though, they may be used to pass certain information to our servers to personalize our Sites and to track your usage across other of our Sites. In addition, we may also use pixel tags in our HTML based e-mails.
We may associate your personally identifiable information with cookies or other tracking utilities our Site places on your computer’s hard drive. Associating a cookie with your contact data allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality. Without cookies, this functionality would not be possible. From time to time, we may use tracking mechanisms such as cookies or web beacons to observe your behavior across multiple websites. We share the information we gather with third parties who serve targeted advertisements to you based on your browsing behaviors. These advertisements are served to you on multiple third party websites. Additionally, on the Sites, there may be certain third-party advertisers whose advertisements contain cookies that collect data from you. Some of those cookies may contain tracking mechanisms that observe your behavior across multiple Sites. Catalina does not control the use of cookies by advertisers or third parties displaying data on the Sites or on the sites you visit using links from the Sites.

When you visit our Sites there may be an opportunity for you to participate in one or more surveys. Your participation in any survey is completely voluntary.

In addition, we may share personally identifiable information with third parties for legitimate business purposes, including for the following reasons or in the following circumstances:
Companies and people who work for us: Because we are a large company, we contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide services. For example, we may host some of our websites on another company’s computers, hire technical consultants to maintain our applications, or work with companies to analyze data, provide marketing assistance, and provide customer service. These other companies may have access to some of the personal information we maintain about our users or employees. Other companies may collect information on our behalf through their sites. This occasionally incorporates the use of frames on the Sites that will not show the URL you are visiting in the browser address window.
Promotional and informational offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of shoppers. To accomplish this we may use third parties working on behalf of Catalina.
Business transfers: We may share personally identifiable information in anticipation of and in the course of an actual or potential sale, reorganization, consolidation, merger, or amalgamation of all or part of our business or operations.
Legal purposes: We may share personal information when we believe it is necessary to cooperate with law enforcement or in response to a government request, including if specifically requested or required, as otherwise permitted by law, to investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable activities, and for other valid Catalina business purposes.
We also may use your personal information on an aggregated basis to provide third parties with information, such as to help us develop new features and content for the Sites, and to provide others with aggregate information about our users and the usage patterns of the Sites.
We retain personally identifiable information for as long as necessary for its legitimate business purposes, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
SECURITY
We use reasonable measures to safeguard sensitive personally identifiable information, which measures are appropriate to the type of information maintained, and follows applicable laws regarding safeguarding any such information under our control.

Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES
From time to time, we will provide links to third-party web sites, or advertisements will contain links to third-party sites. For example, we may link to a third party who is assisting in or is providing online training services. These links are provided as a service to you. These sites are operated by independent entities that have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such other sites or to the use that those entities make of your information. Catalina has no control over the content displayed on such sites, nor over the measures, if any, that are taken by such sites to protect the privacy of your information.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS If you have an established business relationship with us and are a California resident, under California law you may request from us a list of the categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes, and a list of the third parties to whom we have shared that information. We will include in that list the names and addresses of the third parties who received the information and used it (or who we believe may have used it) for their own marketing purposes.
