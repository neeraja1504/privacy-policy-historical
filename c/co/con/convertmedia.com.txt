WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We do not collect or use any Personally Identifiable Information (or “PII”) via the Platform and Service. “PII” is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual and includes such things as name, address, phone number, and email address. ConvertMedia further prohibits its customers from providing PII for use on the Platform.
We also do not collect sensitive consumer information, such as credit card numbers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or information about medical conditions.

HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
The non-PII that we collect is used in order to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance the Platform. The non-PII is also used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our customers and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement. We may also use non-PII data such as demographic, intent and interest related data we receive from third parties for the purpose of bettering our Platform and Service.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?
ConvertMedia may, in order to operate and enhance the Platform and/or the Service, provide non-PII data collected on the Platform to customers, partners, and service providers who may use such non-PII for their commercial purposes.

COOKIES AND TRACKING PIXELS
ConvertMedia uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our Platform and Service. Cookies help ConvertMedia better understand the effectiveness of our customers’ ads (for example, by tracking the way in which a user may respond to, select and interact with an ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which a user views an ad). ConvertMedia’s cookies also help control the number of times a user views a certain ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept cookies, however, he or she may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he or she visits.
ConvertMedia also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.
