CQ Roll Call has maintained a reputation for editorial independence, objectivity and nonpartisan coverage of Congress over 70 years. All content advanced by customers, sponsors and other organizations in no way should be attributed to our company, and the CQ Roll Call logo and brand must not appear in the mailing.
At CQ Roll Call, we have measures in place to protect your privacy. We want to make sure you are comfortable exploring our sites and using our information. The following explains what information we collect about you, how we use it and what choices you have regarding this information. This policy applies to all information collected from or submitted this site. Other CQ Roll Call sites and apps may be covered by their own site-specific privacy policies.
What we know about you
As with all Web sites, this site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the referring site you passed through to reach our site. Any additional information you provide us, such as your name, organization, address, telephone number, e-mail address, interests and products you subscribe to is only collected upon your request. You must, for example, provide such information whenever you subscribe to a product, complete a request for a free trial or, in the case of a subscription site, when you submit a technical support request.
How we use “cookies” and why
Our site uses “cookies” to improve your navigation through the site and to help us make the site more useful to you. A “cookie” is a small text file on your computer’s hard drive that our Web site uses to collect information about how you use our site. The cookie transmits this information back to our Web site each time you visit a page on our site, thus allowing us to identify our most popular pages, features and data. We can then use this information to improve our site and our products to more effectively meet your needs. In the case of our subscription sites, cookies are also used to restrict access to bona fide subscribers and to enable you to set up customized reports, lists and alerts that no other subscribers are permitted to see.
How we use what we learn
Information we collect is used to improve the content of our sites and apps, to develop products and to provide you with information or support you’ve requested. Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers (by CQ Roll Call) that may be of interest to you.
What we tell others about you
We do not furnish to third parties the information that we gather or that you provide to us unless we are legally required to do so. In fact, we work hard to ensure that the information you give us remains confidential and known only by us.
Links to other sites
This site contains links to other sites, including those produced by other organizations. CQ Roll Call is not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any non-CQ Roll Call site.
Advertising
We accept advertising on our sites and apps because the related revenue helps us bring you first-class journalism throughout each day. We use the services of Doubleclick for advertiser reporting.
Choices you have
If you wish to discontinue receiving communications from us at any time, please let us know by e-mailing, calling or writing us (see addresses below).
