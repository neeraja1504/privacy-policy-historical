Privacy and Security
Protecting privacy and ensuring security is important to Consumer Cellular. Our privacy and security policies are outlined below. If you still have questions, feel free to call us at (888) 345-5509(888) 345-5509.
Privacy
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for www.ConsumerCellular.com and applies to information collected both online and offline by Consumer Cellular.
Information collection, use and sharing.
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to collect information that you voluntarily provide via email, our online shopping forms, or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization other than our select partners completing activities on our behalf, or if it is necessary to do so to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order or process your credit approval.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
When contacting us via email, or the 'Contact Us' smart-form, please do not include Account Numbers, Credit Card Numbers, Social Security Numbers or any other identification numbers, aside from phone numbers and/or cellphone numbers. Thank you.
Your access to and control over information.
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. By contacting us via our contact form or calling (888) 345-5509(888) 345-5509, you can do the following at any time:
See what data we have about you, if any.
Change/correct any data we have about you.
Have us delete any data we have about you.
Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
Whenever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page where you provide sensitive information.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information offline. Only Consumer Cellular employees or employees of our select partners completing tasks on our behalf who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or Customer Support) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
On our website, we ask you to identify your geographic area so that we may show you rate plans and phones that we know will work for you based on your location. To do this, we use “cookies.” We also use cookies to help track your order through the shopping process. For cookies to work, you must have cookies turned “on” in the preferences section of your browser. We promise that cookies are used only for the purpose described here and any information collected is never shared or sold to anyone outside our company.
