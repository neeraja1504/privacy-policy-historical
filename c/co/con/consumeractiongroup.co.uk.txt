Consumer Action Group Privacy Policy - Forum Rules - Please read before posting - Consumer Action Group
THE CONSUMER FORUMS PRIVACY POLICY
This policy applies to all forums operated by Reclaim the Right Limited, and includes (but is not limited to) the Consumer Action Group,
Bank Action Group, Debt Action Group and the Consumer Forums. Hereafter, these are referred to as the Consumer Forums.
WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS
Your privacy is a very important matter, and is taken very seriously by the Consumer Forums. Please read the following to learn more
about our privacy policy. In addition to our own attitude to the importance of your privacy, we are also registered with the Information
Commissioner under The Data Protection Act. Our Data Protection Registration number is Z9440256
HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
This policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information relating to your past use of the
Consumer Forums. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or
telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Consumer Forums, or Reclaim the Right Limited, do not own or control,
or to people that we do not employ or manage.
Because of our obligations under the Data Protection Act, we conform with all UK and European standards for the protection of privacy.
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
The Consumer Forums collect personal information when you register with any of our forums or buy our products. When you register we may
ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.
When you register with the Consumer Forums, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
The Consumer Forums collects information about your transactions with us, and with some of our business partners.
The Consumer Forums automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Consumer
Forums cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.
The Consumer Forums uses information for the following general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, fulfil your
requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for our internal
purposes.
The Consumer Forums does not contact its registered users or its visitors about any products or services other than through its newsletter
which has been subscribed to as a part of the forum registration process. The Consumer Forums does not contact any person if that person
has not registered as a forum user - even if that person has bought products or services through our website pages.
CHILDREN
The Consumer Forums does not differentiate between adults and children in relation to its data use policy, and the same safeguards are
applied regardless of age. However we remind parents to be vigilant over their children's use of the Internet, and if they have any concerns
about the Consumer Forums websites they should use the "Complaints about Website Content" button on the left side of the main forum webpage.
UNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS
If you receive an unsolicited telephone call offering legal services from any individual or company claiming to be from the Consumer Forums,
Consumer Action Group, CAG, or any similar name, please email admin@consumeractiongroup.co.uk and do not agree to any service that may be
offered.
We do not do this.
Any company offering legal services in these circumstances will not be authorised by the Consumer Forums, and will be acting in breach of
the law. You should inform us immediately of any contact of this sort and also report it to the police.
INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
The Consumer Forums does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people except under the following circumstances:
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Consumer Forums terms of use, or as
otherwise required by law.
We may transfer information about you if The Consumer Forums is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify
you (by your registered email address) before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
The Consumer Forums do not display targeted advertisements based on personal information.
Targeted advertisements on The Consumer Forums website are context based, and are not related to any information which we may hold about
you as an individual.
The Consumer Forums do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advert. However,
by interacting with or viewing an advert you are consenting to the
possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert. The Consumer Forums
advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stockbrokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial
companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
COOKIES
The Consumer Forums may set and access cookies that it has placed on your computer. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to
these cookies.

from our newsletter by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the the Consumer Forums, such as service announcements, administrative
messages and the Consumer Forums Newsletter. Whilst You have the opportunity to opt out of receiving this information, where we consider
that we have to let you know some important information such as account changes, policy or rule changes etc, then we may contact you anyway.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
