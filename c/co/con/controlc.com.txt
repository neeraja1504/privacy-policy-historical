ControlC
A brief summary, minus legalese
We are ecstatic that you have chosen to use ControlC as your solution to the ever growing problem of clipboard data management. ControlC is a service which will store everything that enters your clipboard onto our servers, forever. We will only send data back that is text- not images, video, files, etc.. We will also send back data if it is copied in a way that is copied OTHER than pressing control + c (IE- Right clicking some text, selecting copy WILL send it to us) Additionally, because of the extreme sensitivity of the data we may collect (passwords, phone #'s, etc..) we triple encrypt all data that enters onto our server. It is with this statement, that we affirm, state and declare that under no circumstance, (even if we wanted to) could we read your data- It is all encrypted with your plain text password (which we dont have- anywhere) and the only person who can unlock the data is YOU- With that limitation, comes some drawbacks- If you were to lose your password, all of your private data would be gone forever (not open to the public, but permanently locked for anyone to see) You can still change your password (We will update the salt) without worry. We make every effort to make this website and service secure- So much so that even if the server was hacked, stolen or otherwise compromised, that even the most experienced of users could not view your data. In short, realise that this is a service where anything that enters your clipboard will be stored on our servers. We will -never- sell any of your private data to anyone- ever. At any time you can contact us via the contact form and request your account be deleted and we will do so within 24 hours. Lastly if you choose to install our software, please be aware it has auto update functionality and we will occasionaly release updates for your approval. (should you choose to use our official application)
Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. This document explains how we use private information collected, and your rights and responsibilities regarding your private information. This privacy policy will always be available on our website for you to review.
The Information We Collect
As a matter of course and functionality, software on our website will track data deemed hyper-personal, such as IP Address, passwords, usernames and anything that enters your clipboard. The software we use may set cookies, if permitted by your computer security restrictions. If you register an account on our website, we will also collect your email address, in order to be able to communicate with you better regarding our site.
If you make a payment to us in any form for any reason, while we do not directly collect payment information from you, our payment processor will send to us certain personally-identifiable information in order to match your transaction and provide a log of payments received through the processor. This information can include, but is not limited to:
Name
Address
Email address
Phone number
We do not directly collect banking or credit card information, and will never have this information stored in our system. Our payment processor may send us a masked copy of your credit or debit card number, however (such as the last 4 digits of your card number).
The Way We Use Information
We do not directly collect your banking or credit card information when you make any payments to us, and as such we do not store this information in our records (outside of the basic log data sent to us by the payment processor). Any information we collect or log will not be shared with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your purchase.
Your email address is used to send you notifications about changes to our website (for example to alert you that a new message is waiting for you) and will not be used for any other purpose. Additionally, you can log into your Control Panel, and elect not to receive notifications from the administrator. Only under extremely rare and important circumstances would we override this election on your part when contacting you.
We may use generic statistical information to better enhance our site. For example, we may group activity on our site based on gender, geographical location, or age - however at no time when reviewing statistical information would we use or supply personally identifying information such as your name or address.
Any information submitted to us during registration, ordering, or normal use of our website will not be used for any purpose other than for it's stated intentions, except as outlined above.
Our Commitment to Data Security
We make every attempt to secure the information and data we have collected through our site. This includes maintaining necessary security updates for the software in use, and implementing practices and policies to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
We do not permit registration and access to our site, nor do we seek to attract or market, to any persons under the age of 13. Portions of our website are guest-viewable, and any person can see these areas of the site. Portions of our site are restricted only to paying customers, and we do not knowingly allow payments from any person under the age of 18. If you believe your child may have registered on our site and wish to restrict their access, please contact the administrator of this site.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
All personally identifiable information that we maintain can be accessed and changed in your Control Panel. You can change this information at any time yourself. If you would like for us to change this information for you, we require that you login to the site, and send a personal message to an administrator, to confirm your account security. We may take other necessary or precautionary steps to ensure your account has not been compromised as we deem necessary.
If at any time you would like to know what logs we have of your payment transactions, you must contact an administrator. We will, at request, remove these logs from our publicly accessible web server, however we will maintain the logs in a local backup for our records.
