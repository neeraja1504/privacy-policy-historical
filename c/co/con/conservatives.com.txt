Our website provides Social Plug-ins of Facebook.com. When you visit one of our sites with Social Plug-ins (recognizable by a white F on a blue tile or a thumb up sign) your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of Facebook. The content of the Plug-in will be transferred to your browser and implemented into the website. The information that you visit our website is now transferred to Facebook. If you are logged on in Facebook during the visit on our website, Facebook adds this information to your Facebook profile. If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, e.g. make a comment, this information will also be transferred to Facebook. In addition, other personal information as your IP address, Browser and other parameter may be transferred to Facebook and stored there.
In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off in Facebook before you enter our website.
We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer by the Facebook Plug-ins. Please see Facebook’s privacy statements for more information on the purpose and extent of data collection by Facebook, as well as how they further process and use your data there, and your related rights and setting options for protecting your privacy: (http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php).More information is also available at www.youronlinechoices.eu
Links
Our website links to other sites, but we shall always try to warn you when this is the case. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites: make sure you read their privacy statements if you are concerned about the information they are collecting about you. This statement only applies to our website.
Security
We take every precaution to protect your details. When you submit sensitive information via the website, it is secure both on its way to us and once we receive it. For instance, our membership and donation forms encrypt your credit card number using SSL encryption technology.
We also do everything in our power to protect your information once we have received it. Our staff can only access your details if they have a specific job to perform, such as dealing with a membership enquiry. They also have to keep up to date on our security and privacy practices.
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
Transfer of your information outside the European Union
As part of the services offered to you through our site, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). By way of example, this may happen if one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected and used only in accordance with our instructions and for the purposes we have indicated to you at the time of collection of the data.
Supplementing Information
We take our responsibilities to protect you from fraud very seriously. To fulfil this obligation, we sometimes have to supplement the information you give us with information from third party sources - usually, in order to make sure that no-one else is using your credit card. We do not keep this information any longer than we have to.
Correcting/Updating Information
We recognise that details such as your post code or email address are bound to change over time. We will do what we can to ensure that you can change the information we hold about you.
Opting out/Unsubscribing
If you have signed up for emails from the Conservative Party but want to stop us getting in touch, you can opt out by following the "unsubscribe" instructions at the foot of every email we send.
Notification of Changes
If we change our privacy policy, we shall post a link to those changes on our homepage so that you always know what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
When we collect information from you, we tell you what we intend to do with it; if we later want to use that information for a different purpose, we shall first send you an email setting out our plans - and it will be up to you whether or not we do so.
