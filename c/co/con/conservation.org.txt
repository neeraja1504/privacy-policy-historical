Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting Conservation International (CI). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. The following Privacy Policy applies to information collected at www.conservation.org, CI-owned or operated online services and mobile apps (jointly “Sites”). By accessing and continuing to use the Sites you acknowledge that you have read and that you agree to the practices described herein.
1. Information Collected
Personally-Identifiable Information
Personally-Identifiable Information ("Personal Information") is information that identifies you, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing address, credit card number (if you use a credit card to make a donation), or organizational affiliation. CI and CI’s service providers only collect Personal Information when you submit such information to sign-up for our personalized services, for example when you sign up for the CI newsletter or donate.
We may collect Personal Information you provide to us over the phone, in email, through a face-to-face conversation, or through online and offline forms such as CI newsletters, surveys, donation forms, event registration, contests, grant applications, grant-related communications and advocacy action alerts that you populate.
When you engage with CI on social media, we may collect basic information on your profile, including your name and profile bio, the size of your following, your social sharing activity and your content preferences from social media platforms used by you.
We may also collect information from or about you from other public online and offline sources, such as LinkedIn, or information published in online or print media, in addition to your use of the Sites or when you communicate with us. For example, when you attend one of our events, we may ask you for your contact information to follow up with you about other opportunities to engage on CI’s mission (see also Section 2, Use of Information)
Device and Location Information
When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected from devices used to visit our Sites, including your computer’s IP address, the type of browser you use. We also get information about in-bound domain names and pages viewed. This data tells us which pages our users visit and what information they volunteer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.
Cookies
We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Sites using certain technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our Cookies Policy for more details).
2. Use of Information
Personal Information
We will only collect and process Personal Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include  consent (where you have given consent) and our legitimate interest in operating, managing and promoting our organization, maintaining our relationship with you and protecting CI and our Sites provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact inquiry@conservation.org
Examples of uses of Personal Information where you have given consent are:
to periodically alert you to CI news and events when you signed up for the CI newsletter or other news updates
to contact you about contests or sweepstakes you entered through our Sites and to invite you to participate in new contests and sweepstakes
to process donations we receive from you (see also Section 4, Security)
to make grant funding decisions, conduct funding related due diligence and administer CI funding agreements
Examples of use and sharing of Personal Information for legitimate interests are:
to customize your web experience or content you receive via email
to respond to your inquiries
to encourage engagement with content on social media platforms
for internal data analysis, for example to identify trends, determine effectiveness of past and current campaigns, enhance current online tools, and plan future digital strategies
to conduct supporter and prospect research
in response to a subpoena or when we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or other legal obligation
in response to a law enforcement agency’s request
to protect the security or confidentiality of our records
in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights
to manage corporate transitions, such as reorganizations
Information Combining, Aggregation and Analysis
We may combine and use data analysis to interpret your information and predict how likely you are to be interested in or responsive to a particular campaign or fundraising communication. If we conclude that you have the potential or interest in supporting CI’s efforts at a higher level, we may collect additional publicly available information about you and combine and analyze that information into a donor profile, which allows us to engage with you in a customized manner that is responsive to your supporter interest. We commonly look at and combine information from public information resources and other data sources that you chose to make available publicly on your social media channels to give insight into your philanthropic interests and ability to support us. In addition, we may use trusted third party companies that analyze and measure available information to assess affluence. This helps us understand more about your interests and level of potential engagement or donation. Examples of companies that assist us in this process are WealthX and Blackbaud. You can opt out of your data being combined and analyzed for prospect research by contacting us as described in Section 3 (Your Choices).
In some instances, we may combine Personal Information with Device Information or Location Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
We may aggregate non-personally identifiable information collected from you and other users as well as Device Information or Location Information to produce general statistics that cannot be linked to your or any specific user and with which we attempt to provide you with a better experience on our Sites, to improve services, and to analyze and understand how our Sites are used.
Sharing
Some of the ways we use your Personal information require us to share information with third parties, so we can provide an effective user experience and comply with laws that apply to us:
Service Providers and Professional Advisors. Third party companies that we engage to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Some information we acquire may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. For example, when you take a quiz on CI’s website, any Personal Information you submit is stored in the database of the third-party quiz provider, where it is made available for CI to download. These data are compiled in another trusted third-party database and customer relationship management tool.
Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or CI; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
Affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, the successor organization of CI).
Retention
We keep your Personal Information only so long as we need it fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your Personal Information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that you cannot be identified.
