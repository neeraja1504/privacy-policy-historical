Our Commitment to Protecting Your Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. The Conservative Party will respect your privacy through the protection of any of your personal information that you provide to us. We take great care to keep both confidential and secure all personal information in our possession.
As a federal political party registered under the Canada Elections Act, the Conservative Party including its electoral district associations (“riding associations”), candidates, nomination contestants and leadership contestants are subject to extensive regulation under that Act, including in particular public disclosure requirements for contributions over $200.
What is “Personal Information”
“Personal Information” is information about an identifiable individual. It includes information such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and other contact information.
Collecting Personal Information
Elections Canada provides all political parties with a list of electors, including names and postal addresses. We collect other information from publicly available data.
We collect personal information from donors and members when they contribute to our Party or purchase a membership. You may also choose to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis, such as when registering for an event or signing a petition. We are required by law to keep records of donors for tax purposes.
If you submit your e-mail address and/or personal information through our website, you consent to being added to our e-mail list. You may unsubscribe from our e-mail list at any time using the link provided in each email message, or by clicking here.
Usage of Personal Information
We use your personal information to communicate with you. As a political party, we believe it is important to communicate with Canadians on a regular basis.
As a national organization with a riding-based membership system, your personal information may also be disclosed to our local riding associations, candidates, nomination contestants and leadership contestants who may also communicate with you.
