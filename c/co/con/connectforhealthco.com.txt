Connect for Health Colorado Privacy Policy
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This policy tells you why we collect information, what information we collect, and what we do with it. Our website ConnectforHealthCO.com doesn’t collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about you during your visit to our website unless you choose to provide it to us. We do, however, collect non-PII related information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our site. We will not knowingly disclose your personal information to a third party, except as provided in this statement.
By submitting personal information to Connect for Health Colorado (the Marketplace) or by using our website, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose any such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not provide your personal information.
Why we collect information
The Marketplace is authorized to collect personal information during your application for health-related benefits and will confirm information that may affect initial or ongoing eligibility for all persons listed on your application. The information you provide is needed for the purposes of determining health insurance eligibility or other purposes permitted by law and to give you the best services possible if you choose to apply.
You are allowing the Marketplace to use Social Security numbers and other PII from your application in order to shop and apply for benefits and you release the Marketplace from all liability for sharing this information with other agencies for this purpose.
Types of information we collect
Information you give us:   As part of the process, we will communicate with you or your authorized representative, and then provide the information to the health plan you select so that they can enroll those who are eligible in a qualified health plan. Information on race and ethnicity will generally not be provided to the insurance carriers, unless you are an American Indian or Alaska Native because that information could positively affect your benefits. We will verify your answers using information in our electronic databases and the databases of partner agencies. If the information you provide does not match these sources, we may ask you to send us proof of the information you provide.
The Marketplace may get and share your information with any of the following agencies: Social Security Administration; United States Customs and Immigration Services; Department of Homeland Security; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; other federal or state agencies; and Agents/Brokers and managing general agencies contracting with those agents/brokers, as applicable, which are certified by the Marketplace to assist applicants/enrollees.

Information we get from your use of our website:   When you use our website, we may collect certain information about your visit.  Information is collected as part of overall performance and effectiveness monitoring and helps us measure the number of visitors to our site, make the site more useful, and to improve our public education and outreach communications.
