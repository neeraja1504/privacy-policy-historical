Privacy Policy | Contact Form 7
Protecting your privacy is our priority. This page explains how the personal information we collect through this website (contactform7.com) will be treated. Since we are not lawyers, we’ll provide this information in familiar FAQ style.
Who are you?
We are Rock Lobster, LLC., a Japan-based company founded by Takayuki Miyoshi. We have developed several WordPress plugins including Contact Form 7, Flamingo, and Bogo.
What information do you store?
We store user input data sent through the contact forms on this website, along with meta information about the submissions, including the time stamp, the origin IP address, and the user agent (browser). Also, third party services may collect information about website visitors. We currently use Google Analytics, Google AdSense, and BuySellAds.com on this website.
Where does the information go?
We use the Contact Form 7 plugin to manage contact form submissions. The information is sent as email messages that only a select few are allowed to access. The information is also stored in the database on our hosting server for backup and later reference purposes. We use the Flamingo plugin to safely manage this data. WP Engine hosts this website.
How long do you keep the information?
We don’t set a particular time limit on storing information because we need it for future reference. If you want your information to be removed from our database, please contact us. We will remove it anytime there are concerns about your privacy.
Do you share the information with other parties?
No, although we do use some WordPress plugins on this website that may pass data, including personal information, to external servers to process, such as Akismet Anti-Spam or Jetpack by WordPress.com.
We only use WordPress plugins and themes that are hosted by WordPress.org. WordPress.org’s guidelines clearly prohibit tracking users without their explicit informed consent.
