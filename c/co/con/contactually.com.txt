Privacy Policy | Contactually
Last updated: May 31, 2018
Contactually does not access your contacts for marketing purposes. We also do not sell, give, or trade your contacts to other companies.
Some Contactually services are provided in partnership with a third-party. If the third-party is allowed to retain and reuse the information that Contactually sends on your behalf (for example, in contact signature scraping), you may choose whether to use those services by adjusting your Contactually settings. If you do not participate in the service, Contactually will not send data to the service provider on your behalf.
Your contacts and activity history are not shared with other Contactually users. One exception may be sharing within your own company/team, based on your settings. If you do not know if your account has been set up to share contacts with others in your company, please ask your team administrator or trainer, or reach out to our Support team at support@contactually.com for assistance.
Contactually processes the content of the contact communications (e.g. emails, text messages, etc.) to which you have provided us access only to enhance our services for you. Contactually does not market to you or your contacts based on the content of your communications, and we do not share that content.
