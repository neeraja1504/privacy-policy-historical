Connect6° | Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 15, 2014
We at Connect6, Inc., along with our subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Connect6°"), respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect about our consumers, how we may use the information and with whom we may share it. The notice also describes the measures we take to safeguard the personal information. In addition, we tell you how you can ask us to (i) access or change the personal information we maintain about you, (ii) withdraw consent you previously provided to us, (iii) refrain from sending you certain communications, and (iv) answer questions you may have about our privacy practices
Information We Obtain
We may obtain personal information about Connect6° consumers and users (such as name, contact details and payment information) in connection with various activities such as (i) use of the Connect6° websites and services (ii) publicly-available information about people and companies captured from technology scans of the Internet, (iii) licensed information from other companies, (iv) events in which we participate, and (v) promotions and other offers.
Connect6° creates profiles of business people and companies, which we call "Public Profiles," from different sources. Once Connect6° has collected information about a person or company, Connect6° combines multiple mentions of the same person or company into a Public Profile. The resulting directory of Public Profiles (the "Directory") is then made available to the users of the website and service and Connect6°‘s customers and strategic partners.
The types of personal information we may obtain include:
Individual and business contact information (such as name, company name, physical address, email address, and telephone or fax number)
Information that enables us to verify your identity
Names, email addresses and telephone numbers of others to whom we are asked to send information
Username and password to access Connect6° products and services online
Social media handles
Payment information (including payment card details or online payment services number and billing address) and financial information (such as bank account number)
Tax identification number in circumstances in which you request products or services for which this information is required, or in connection with certain promotions or sweepstakes
Other personal information that may be provided to us to obtain a Connect6° product or service
Information we may receive from third parties
When you make information publicly available on your social networking page, we may collect that information.
If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to us is covered by this policy. For example, if you access our websites or services through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Connect6° application, linking your account to the Connect6° services, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Connect6°. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us including contacts or “Friends,” and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
In addition, when you visit our websites or use our services, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits. A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain "clickstream data," which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. We also may use third-party website analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites.

We may supplement data we collect through automated means with information about your location (such as your zip code) to provide you with content that may be of interest to you. We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our websites, identify users of our websites, and gather demographic information about our users. We use clickstream data to determine how much time users spend on web pages of our websites, how users navigate through our websites, and how we may tailor our websites to better meet the needs of our users.
We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.
Interest-Based Advertising
On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We recommend that you check back periodically to ensure that your Public Profile contains only the information you choose to have displayed. The best way to avoid having your information found by our search engine (or any other search engine) is to contact the operator of the website that contains the original source(s) of the information and ask for the operator to remove the displayed Information from the web.
