Last updated: June 5, 2016
Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and services (collectively, “Cornerstone” or “Website”).
For our client data privacy policy, please see the related page.
By visiting or using any part of this Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Website, this Privacy Policy may change, so please check this web page for updates to our Privacy Policy. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is a part of, this Website’s Terms of Use agreement, which also governs your use of this Website.
Collection of information
When you visit our Website, we may collect information regarding your visit from your computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our Website, the date you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you to our Website. We collect this information to continually improve and enhance the functionality of Cornerstone.
The information you may provide us with is classified into two general types (user-provided information and website usage information), both of which are discussed in greater detail below.
Personal information you choose to provide
In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. Personal information includes, for example, your name and e-mail address, both of which you may be asked to provide when registering with Cornerstone. A description of some of the ways that you may provide personal information to us, as well as further details on how we may use such personal information, is given below.
1. Contact us/feedback
If you e-mail us through a "Contact us" link on our Website, we may ask you for information such as your name and e-mail address so we can respond to your questions and comments. If you choose to correspond with us via e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages, your e-mail address and our response to you. In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your e-mails to us on the Website.
2. Questionnaires and surveys
We may occasionally ask viewers of our Website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of Cornerstone. When requesting your participation in these surveys, we may ask you to provide us with your name and e-mail address.
3. Bulletin Boards
Our Website may offer its users the opportunity to use bulletin board blogs and chat rooms and to engage in discussions with other users. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any personal information you submit through these features can be read, collected or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message that helps us to verify an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your personal information. We use information provided from clear GIFs to allow more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing and make Cornerstone better for our users.
3. IP address and Clickstream data
Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us.

We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet service provider. Personal information (including IP addresses) is not used to facilitate contact with users who have not provided their contact details to CSOD. Your IP address may be used to identify the clickstream that led you to our site; however, personal information is not shared with any third-party marketing companies.

Information relating to aggregated statistics will be collected through the use of third-party cookies and other third-party tracking devices.

By providing Personal Information to us through this Website, you agree that it may be used by us and our Affiliated Parties for the purposes described herein, and you further understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, which may have different privacy laws from your country of residence, and which may afford varying levels of protection for your Personal Information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, we will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Third-party websites
When you are on this Website, you may have the opportunity to visit or link to other websites, including other websites operated by us or by unaffiliated third parties. These websites may collect Personal Information about you, and (because this Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other websites) you should review the privacy policies of such other websites to see how they treat your personal information.
Privacy of minors
This Website is not directed at children under the age of thirteen. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on our Website. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on our Website, we will delete the information from our records.
Security
We use commercially reasonable and industry-standard physical, management and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when transmitting sensitive information. Whilst we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee information, either during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
If you contact us by e-mail or a “Contact us” or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We accept no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts by third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If notification is appropriate, we shall endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and (insofar as we have your e-mail address) we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you would prefer us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at info@csod.com with the alternative contact information you would like us to use.
Updates to our privacy statement
