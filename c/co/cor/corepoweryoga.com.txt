Privacy Policy
Effective date: May 1, 2015
CorePower Yoga, LLC (“CorePower Yoga,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) owns and operates this website (this “Site”). This Online Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes our commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping your trust.
Scope of This Policy
This Policy applies to the information we collect from or about you through this Site. It does not apply to information we collect through other channels, such as over phone or in person, at our studios.

Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address.
CorePower Yoga has provided this Policy so that you will know what information CorePower Yoga collects, how CorePower Yoga uses this information, the types of third parties with whom CorePower Yoga may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.
Your Consent
By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy. If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information as described in this Policy, you may not use this Site.

Your Choices

Do Not Track Mechanisms. California law requires this Policy to address how we respond to any “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

Otherwise, please contact us using the information provided below. You may opt out of promotional emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any promotional email we send you.
This Policy May Change

You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy” at the bottom of each page of the public areas of this Site.

Generally, we use this information in the aggregate to help us improve this Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you.
