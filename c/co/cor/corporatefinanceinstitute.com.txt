CFI may use, disclose, transfer and retain non-personal information for any purpose and in any manner whatsoever.

15.            Other Websites and Businesses
CFI’s websites and correspondence (including emails and messages) may include advertisements for products and services offered by independent businesses or links to websites operated by independent businesses.

As will be evident, in such a case, you will be leaving a CFI website and going to the third party’s website. Any information provided to such third party social networking sites and other sites is governed by their own privacy policies, which you may read on the applicable site. You are solely responsible for the personal information that you choose to post or share in those situations.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of those provisions applies to any dispute that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy or CFI’s collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect as if they were reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy. Nothing in this Privacy Policy amends any of those other agreements.
(b)             Changes to this Policy:   CFI may change this Privacy Policy as it applies to CFI from time to time by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on CFI’s websites.
