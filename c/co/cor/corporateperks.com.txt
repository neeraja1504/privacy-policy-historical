Your first name, last name, valid email address, and zip code represent the only pieces of personal information you must submit to access Corporate Perks. In certain instances, other demographic data or payment card information will be collected, but not required. Corporate Perks uses this information to provide the benefits/services associated with the program.

Corporate Perks is a portal through which users access discounts redeemable at selected vendors. In most cases, online purchases facilitated by the Corporate Perks portal are subject to the privacy policies of the Web Site where that transaction is conducted. In a few cases; however, Corporate Perks itself functions as the vendor and must collect additional personal information, described later in this privacy policy, to complete the online transaction.
When users register a payment card through Corporate Perks's registered card program, we collect payment card information for the purpose of tracking transactions from participating registered card program vendors. Collected card information is used in the authentication of the payment card with our financial services partners (card issuers, processors, and network associations such as American Express, Master Card, and VISA). Corporate Perks will also collect, process and store transaction data from vendors participating in the registered card program for the purpose of applying the appropriate discount to the users payment card and to improve the design and vendor selection of the site.
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a spouse/family member about our site, we will ask you for your spouse/family member's name and email address. We will automatically send your spouse/family member a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Next Jump, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your spouse/family member may contact Next Jump, Inc. Customer Service to request that we remove this information from our database.

Next Jump, Inc. only shares aggregated data to third party vendors, but it will not disclose information specific to any user or organization, including email address except as described in this privacy policy. This information represents a generic overview of our users' collective viewing habits and allows vendors to modify their discounts based on user traffic. To fulfill certain purchases by you, it may be necessary for us to share your information with our partners. Additionally, some participating organizations have requested monthly reports of traffic on Corporate Perks. These reports will reveal only the aggregated viewing habits of Corporate Perks visitors from that organization. The reports will not disclose the user name, login ID or any other personal information of users, including email address.
When users give money to nonprofits through our Charitable Giving program, we will share personal information including email address, with the chosen nonprofit only if permitted. Nonprofits use the contact information for acknowledgment purposes and to provide tax receipts. We will not share this information unless you opt-in and thereby indicate to us to notify the nonprofit of your gift. If you wish to discontinue receiving information from the respective nonprofit, please contact them directly.
When users RSVP to an in-store retail event, limited information is provided to the participating merchant in the form of the guest list for admittance into the private event. This information is limited to your first name and last name, and if you will be bringing a guest.
