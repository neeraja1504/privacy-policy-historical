Any information submitted by you will be used solely for the purpose of completing the transaction, delivering the product to you or your clients and addressing any customer service issues.

The SSL protocol maintains the security and integrity of the transmission channel by using encryption, authentication and message authentication codes using public and private key combinations, read more here: http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html and here:
