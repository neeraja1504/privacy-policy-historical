CornellSun.com Privacy Policy | The Cornell Daily Sun
This privacy policy describes what information we collect from you as you use CornellSun.com. Updates will be posted to this page, so be sure to check back periodically to check for changes. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at any time.
What information we collect
If you browse our site as an “anonymous user,” without registering a user account, our site collects only information automatically transmitted to our web server by your computer. This information includes your IP address, user agent string, and what features your browser supports.
You can choose to register an account by providing us with a username, email address and password. As a registered user, you have access to a user profile page. You can provide additional information, such as your geographical location, personal interest and a short biography, for display on your profile page. Providing this information is optional, and you can choose to edit or remove any of it at any time by logging in and clicking your username in the top right corner of the site.
How we collect information
In addition to our own server logs, we use the Google Analytics service (http://google.com/analytics) to collect information about your web browser and computer. This information is stored securely on Google’s servers.
How we use your information
We use our collected information to analyze how and by whom the site is being used, so that we can improve our features and quality of service.
Usernames, email addresses and passwords that you choose to provide as a registered user will be used only to give you access to your account and profile on the site. Passwords are securely stored in an encrypted form in our database; no staff member of CornellSun.com or The Cornell Daily Sun has access to your original password; if you forget your password, it must be reset to a new value.
Other optional information provided by you is stored and displayed on your user profile page solely for your convenience.
Communications from The Sun
If you choose to register an account, we will use the email address that you provide to email you a confirmation email at the time of registration. Additionally, if you forget your password, a new password will be mailed to your email address upon your request.
We provide an email subscription service that registered users can choose to participate in. If you subscribe to this service, we will mail news headlines to your registered address on a regular basis (usually daily or weekly, depending on whether or not the print edition of The Sun is in publication at the time). Additionally, we will mail breaking news alerts to your email address as they occur.
