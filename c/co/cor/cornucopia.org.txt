Cornucopia’s Privacy Policy - Cornucopia Institute
The Cornucopia Institute values your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we protect the privacy of website visitors and donors. This Policy also outlines how you can update your information or communication preferences and how you can receive additional information.
Protecting Donor Information
Cornucopia uses electronic security systems to protect records containing personal identifying information that donors provide when giving a gift, whether online or off. This information is stored in a secure database that a limited number of staff have access to. We use this information to send donors eNews, action alerts, hardcopy newsletters, membership renewals and appeals, and other relevant communications throughout the year. If you would like to review your donor information or change your communications preferences, please email us at [email protected] Due to the controversial nature of our work, we never publish, share, sell, or otherwise distribute donor information, unless required to do so by law.
Online Giving
All online donations to Cornucopia are processed by an integrated third-party vendor that specializes in secure donations (Blackbaud). Submissions are encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, the industry standard for secure online transactions. All personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, is encrypted. All online transactions (whether one time or sustaining donations) are handled by a secure third-party donation management provider; Cornucopia staff do not have access to credit card information, nor is this information stored in our secure donor database. State laws require us to let online donors know how they can access financial information about The Cornucopia Institute. Please see the section below on State Disclosures for this information.
Visitors to our Website: Non-Personal Identifying Information
Cornucopia collects and uses non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses and web server log files. We also uses cookies to identify individual computers accessing our website. Cornucopia uses this information only in the aggregate to gauge interest in our web content. We do not combine non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information, known as online profiling. At no time is personal information stored in a cookie.
Cornucopia shares a summary of non-identifying aggregated information about website usage with funders to show the impact of our communications work. For example, we may share with our donors or a foundation that 100,000 people visited the carrageenan scorecard last year.
Personal Identifying Information
If you voluntarily provide personal identifying information (such as name, address, e-mail address) through online or hardcopy forms, Cornucopia will collect and retain this information to fulfill the related request. For example, if you subscribe to our eNews, your name and e-mail address will be stored so that we can send you the eNews regularly until you unsubscribe.
Cornucopia makes this personal identifying information available to other organizations only when this is made explicit on the collection form. For instance, when you fill out a proxy letter or sign a petition, the information you provide is transmitted to the government agency targeted for that action.
In addition, Cornucopia may share information with business partners in order to execute a requested service. For example, Cornucopia may use a third-party vendor (like Constant Contact) to distribute the eNews, which requires sharing email addresses with that vendor. We only partner with vendors who respect our privacy terms.
E-mail Communications
Cornucopia sends out bi-weekly eNews, periodic action alerts, and other mission and development related communications via email to interested parties. These communications are intended to be relevant. If you wish to unsubscribe, all group emails offer an easy unsubscribe option at the bottom of the message. In the unlikely event that you have unsubscribed and are still receiving emails, please contact us at [email protected] or call us on 608-625-2000 to be manually removed from future email communications.
Links
Cornucopia’s website contains links to other sites. Cornucopia does not control, and is not responsible for, the privacy policies of those other sites. When clicking on a link from the Cornucopia website, please make yourself aware of that site’s privacy policy.
Google Services
Cornucopia uses Google Analytics Demographics for website use analysis, which provides us reports on the aggregate age, gender and interests of site visitors. We do not obtain, store or otherwise have access to personal information about individual website visitors.
Cornucopia uses Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online to visitors who have come to our site. This tailored advertising is enabled by the Google Analytics cookie and the DoubleClick cookie. Google and other third-party vendors may show Cornucopia ads on sites across the Internet to visitors with these or other, similar, Cornucopia remarketing cookies.
You can use Google’s Ads’ Settings to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads to your interests.
Protecting Children’s Privacy
In an effort to comply voluntarily with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, Cornucopia does not knowingly collect and retain personal identifying information from children under the age of 13. We urge children to talk with their parents before entering any personal information in Cornucopia web forms. If Cornucopia learns that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information.
