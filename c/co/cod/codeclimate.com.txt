Visitors
Like most website operators, Code Climate Inc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Code Climate Inc's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Code Climate Inc's visitors use its website. From time to time, Code Climate Inc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Code Climate Inc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Code Climate Inc does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Code Climate Inc's websites choose to interact with Code Climate Inc in ways that require Code Climate Inc to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Code Climate Inc gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Code Climate Inc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Code Climate Inc. Code Climate Inc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Code Climate Inc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Code Climate Inc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Code Climate Inc believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Code Climate Inc, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Code Climate Inc may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Code Climate Inc and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Code Climate Inc takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
