Service Providers and CowBoom's Information Sharing Practices
CowBoom uses third party service providers to receive and inspect your shipped product, fill and deliver your order, charge your credit card, provide customer service, and to enhance your shopping experience by displaying ads based on your interests. To help us understand and enhance our interactions with you, we may permit providers (such as web analytic providers, advertising companies and others) to collect personal and other information about your online activities over time on our websites and online services and across other sites on the internet.
Third party service providers and suppliers are required to keep confidential any personally identifiable information received on behalf of CowBoom and are not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
Where applicable, CowBoom may disclose personally identifiable information to its product suppliers for the purposes of automated manufacturer warranty registration, sales reporting, and third party warranty registration.
We may also share personally identifiable information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, and other legal action, or if CowBoom reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect CowBoom, its customers or the public.
CowBoom does not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to others.
