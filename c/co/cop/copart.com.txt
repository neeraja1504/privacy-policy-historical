Online Tracking Information and "Do Not Track" signals
When you visit this site, other parties such as third-party advertising partners and analytics providers may collect information about your online activity over time and across websites. This information may include identifiers that may permit those parties to serve tailored ads to your device. Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Copart currently does not alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser.
Cookies
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer, tablet, mobile or handheld device, or any other access device (each an "Access Device"). The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this website or a Copart App to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Copart may use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). In addition, Copart uses encrypted cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs onto the website or through a Copart App. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser or through the appropriate "settings" icon of certain Access Devices. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Copart, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future.

o Vendors and Partners - Copart works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.
