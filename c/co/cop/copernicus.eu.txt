For the purposes of this website, the data is being processed by FDC and SpaceTec Partners (data processers) under an EU-funded framework contract (385/PP/2014/FC). You can contact individuals at either organisation or at [support [at] copernicus.eu]. Our data protection officer contact details are [frederic.collomb [at] fdc.eu].
For the purposes of workshop organisation, a separate privacy policy can be found here .

Personal information retention period
With respect to the Copernicus Observer newsletter, your personal data will be retained for as long as you choose to remain subscribed.

All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only persons who need the information to fulfil their duties are granted access to personal data. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by contacting us directly.

Without prejudice to your right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data at any time, your personal data will be deleted one year after the close of the project. Where we are retaining the data to meet our contractual requirements with the European Commission, this data will be deleted after 2 years or when the contractual obligation with the European Commission that requires the use of your personal data ends.
