The United States has not been determined to provide adequate data protection. However, where any customer data or personal data may be transferred to a third party service provider outside the EU, Copart only does so on the basis of a written contract which incorporates obligations for the protection of such data in accordance with standards set by the EU, also known as a model clause contract.

Cookies
We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer or mobile device. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of Copart websites or Electronic Services to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.
We may use cookies to track user traffic patterns on Copart websites or Electronic Services, but we do not use cookies to track your use of third party websites.
In addition, we use encrypted cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs on to our website or Electronic Services. It is not possible to log in to our members’ area with­out accepting these cookies – this means you cannot bid on Copart UK or Copart UAE lots without accepting these cookies.
Accepting the log-in cookies will enable you to access the members’ area of our website or Electronic Services, but some other features and services (for example creating customised searches for vehi­cles) may not function properly or conveniently if your other cookies are disabled.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. Alternatively you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies; this means you will receive the warning message with each cookie.
Communications
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to our services and your account with us, including but not limited to notifications, service announcements, and administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them (although we will obtain your consent at the time you create your account). Should you choose not to receive such communications your continued access to or use of our services may not be possible.
Data Storage
We may store your account information in our databases indefinitely following the termi­nation of your account with us to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Confidentiality and Security
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our legal respon­sibilities to protect personal information about you.
If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using our website or Electronic Services or providing personal in­formation to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding secu­rity, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website or Electronic Services. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or, if you are an individual, to withdraw your con­sent from receiving electronic notices) you should notify us at privacy@copart.co.uk.
We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures we take to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these measures for different types of information you may provide to us:
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
We use SSL encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as finan­cial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is dis­played on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time we ask you for a credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and ei­ther the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.
Vendors and Partners
We work with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user informa­tion.
Employee and Contractor Access to Information
We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who we rea­sonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
Education and Training for Employees
We have implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every Copart UK and Copart UAE employee.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the date at the start of this document. For changes to this policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the information we collect. Your con­tinued use of this website constitutes your agreement to this policy and any updates.
