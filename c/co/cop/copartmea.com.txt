We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer.  The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of Copart websites or Electronic Services to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.  But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. Alternatively you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies; this means you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to our services and your account with us, including but not limited to notifications, service announcements, and administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them (although we will obtain your consent at the time you create your account).

We may store your account information in our databases indefinitely following the termination of your account with us to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Confidentiality and Security **  **
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our legal responsibilities to protect personal information about you.
If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or Electronic Services or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website or Electronic Services.

We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures we take to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these measures for different types of information you may provide to us:
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
We use SSL encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time we ask you for a credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.
Vendors and Partners
We work with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.
Employee and Contractor Access to Information
We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
Education and Training for Employees
We have implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every Copart employee across Bahrain, Oman and the UAE.

We may update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the date at the start of this document. For changes to this policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the information we collect.
