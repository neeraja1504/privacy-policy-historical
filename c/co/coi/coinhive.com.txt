Privacy
We respect your privacy. We only keep track of the absolute minimum of information that is necessary to operate this service.
JavaScript Miner, Captcha, Shortlinks
We do not track users. We do not use cookies for purposes other than to store an opt-in token. We do not use any third party tracking (Google Analytics, Piwik, …).
We never load any resources from hosts other than Coinhive's own. For example, we do not load any Fonts from Google Fonts, neither do we use a CDN for JavaScript sources.
We keep your IP address on our servers in working memory (RAM) only. In case of a missbehaving client, the IP address will be kept in RAM for at most 48h. All other IP adresses are purged shortly after you disconnect from our servers.
We do not store your IP address.
We may use localStorage() to synchronize miners across multiple browser tabs. A random ID and timestamp is stored in the browser. This information never leaves the browser.
For the JavaScript Miner, a website owner may choose to disclose your user name or user id on that website to our servers. In this case, your user name/id will be stored alongside the number hashes solved. No other information is stored on our servers.
