Why we collect personal information and how we use it

When we can, we aggregate and anonymize this information such that you are never identified as an individual. For the avoidance of doubt, with this practice we try to present information in segments or categories and remove any personally identifiable information from the data.
We will not sell or rent your personal information to third-parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize Coins.ph services, content and advertising.

How we protect and store personal information
Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.
We store and process your personal information on our computers in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere in the world where Coins.ph facilities or our service providers are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption. We enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files. And we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
In our offices we have organized departments so that those persons who are authorized to view, monitor, analyze, and manage personal information are isolated from other employees.
Rights of Coins.ph customers
Filipino citizens and residents that are customers of Coins.ph irrespective of current jurisdiction have been guaranteed certain privacy and information security rights under the Data Privacy Act 2012. Coins.ph adheres to rights expressly stated in the Act where applicable.
How we share personal information to fulfill Coins.ph services
To process your payments we may securely share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. This includes your contact information; date of sign-up; the number of payments you have received from verified Coins.ph users; and, whether you have verified control of a bank account. We manage these data sharing activities by the guidelines of our information security policy as well as this policy. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third-parties when you use these third-parties to access Coins.ph services.

If you are buying goods or services and pay using Coins.ph, we may also provide the seller with your shipping and confirmed billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide the buyer with the seller’s address so that any goods can be returned to the seller.
We work with third-parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using Coins.ph. In this case a third-party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third-party. We use this information to confirm that you are a Coins.ph customer and that bitcoin as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you, to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a Coins.ph customer with a third-party we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and Coins.ph cannot be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.
