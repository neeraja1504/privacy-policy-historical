We also ensure we have appropriate contractual protections in place with these third parties.
By using CoinBundle, you consent to your Personal Information being transferred to other countries, including countries that have different data protection rules than your country. In all such transfers, we will protect your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We do not maintain a published list of all of the third parties with whom we share your Personal Information with, as this would be heavily dependent on your specific use of our Services. However, if you would like further information about who we have shared your Personal Information with, or to be provided with a list specific to you, you can request this by writing to support@coinbundle.com.
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers store and process your Personal Information in the European Union, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America, and elsewhere in the world.
We may use Automated Decision Making (“ADM”) in order to improve your experience, or to help fight financial crime. For example, so that we can provide you with fast and efficient service, we may use ADM to confirm the accuracy of the information you have provided to us. None of our ADM processes have a legal effect on you.
Your financial acquisitions may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks, which are not controlled or operated by CoinBundle or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter Personal Information from such networks.
As CoinBundle and its affiliates are subject to various legal, compliance and reporting obligations, including BSA or national AML requirements (as defined above), we are required by law to store some of your personal and transactional data beyond the closure of your account with us. Your data is only accessed internally on a need to know basis, and it will only be accessed or processed if absolutely necessary. We will delete data that is no longer required by any relevant law or jurisdiction in which we operate.
Subject to applicable laws, you may have the right to access information we hold about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the relevant data protection legislation. For further information, please contact support@coinbundle.com.
Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.
CoinBundle is not directed to persons under the age of 18, hereinafter “Minors”, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Minors. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from a Minor, we will take legally permissible measures to remove that information from our records. CoinBundle will require the user to close his or her account and will not allow the use of CoinBundle Services. If you are a parent or guardian of a Minor, and you become aware that a Minor has provided Personal Information to CoinBundle, please contact us at support@coinbundle.com and you may request to exercise your applicable access, rectification, cancellation, and/or objection rights.
Any questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to support@coinbundle.com.
Where we have a legal obligation to do so, we have appointed data protection officers (“DPOs”) to be responsible for CoinBundle’s privacy program for the respective data controllers. If you have any questions about how we protect or use your Personal Information, you can contact our DPOs by email at support@coinbundle.com.
If you feel that we have not addressed your questions or concerns adequately, you may contact your data controller.
