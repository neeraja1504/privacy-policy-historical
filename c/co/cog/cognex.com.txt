We may transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA to other Cognex entities and where our subcontractors or processors host data or process outside the EEA. If we do, we will ensure a similar degree of security of Personal Data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
Where we share Personal Data among Cognex entities or where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.
In those cases, you will have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above (e.g. to request a copy where the safeguard is documented, which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality), by contacting us as indicated in Section 9, “Contact us”.
