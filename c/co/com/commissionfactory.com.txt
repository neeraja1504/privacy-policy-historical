Commission Factory holds your personal information on servers located in Australia
All Data, including personal and non-personal information, that is entered into the Service by You, or automatically imported on Your instruction, is transferred to Commission Factory's servers as a function of transmission across the Internet. By using the Service, You consent to Your personal information being transferred to our servers as set out in this Policy.
Currently our servers are located in Australia (AU), primarily by Indigo Solutions Pty Ltd (Indigo), and Your personal information will be routed through, and stored on, those servers as part of the Service. If the location of our servers change in the future, we will update this Policy. You should review our Policy regularly to keep informed of any updates.
By providing Your personal information to Commission Factory, You consent to Commission Factory storing Your personal information on servers hosted in Australia. While Your personal information will be stored on servers located in Australia, it will remain within Commission Factory's effective control at all times. The server host's role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to Commission Factory, and we've taken steps to ensure that our server hosts do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, Your personal information.
If You do not want Your personal information to be transferred to a server located in Australia, You should not provide Commission Factory with Your personal information or use the Service.
Commission Factory takes steps to protect your personal information
Commission Factory is committed to protecting the security of Your personal information and we take all reasonable precautions to protect it from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Your personal information is stored on secure servers that have SSL Certificates issued by leading certificate authority DigiCert Inc, and all Data transferred between You and the Service is encrypted.
However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your information will be secure at all times. Transmission of personal information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only enter, or instruct the entering of, personal information to the Service within a secure environment.
We will advise You at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of a security breach where Your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorised persons or in any unauthorised manner.
Commission Factory only discloses Your Personal Information in limited circumstances
Commission Factory will only disclose the personal information You have provided to us to entities outside the Commission Factory group of companies if it is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your personal information was collected pursuant to this Policy, including the provision of the Service.
Commission Factory will not otherwise disclose Your personal information to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However, You should be aware that Commission Factory may be required to disclose Your personal information without Your consent in order to comply with any court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process or investigation including by tax authorities, if such disclosure is required by law. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You if we are required by law to disclose Your personal information.
The third parties who host our servers do not control, and are not permitted to access or use Your personal information except for the limited purpose of storing the information. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users of the Service, Commission Factory does not currently "disclose" personal information to third parties located overseas.
Upon receipt of your application to join the Commission Factory service your business details and/or ASIC information may be obtained to do a prior check of the status of your business and verify your operation.
