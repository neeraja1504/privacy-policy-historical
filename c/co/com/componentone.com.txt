In this process, we only collect basic personal data about you that includes some or all of your name, organization, job title, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, contact history, order history, information selection choices, and product usage information from GrapeCity and/or our Technology Partners. It also includes information you provide to us (whether requested by us or not) in emails, on the telephone, in voicemails and in computer chats, and a record of sign-ins to your GrapeCity account.
If you choose not to create an account or download a trial version of our software, we will not have collected any of your personal data, but you will still be able to use many of the information features of our website that do not require registration.

We are the developers/publishers of the software products that we sell. When you purchase software products, your name, organization, street address, and email address are registered with us in order to identify you as a legitimate licensee.
