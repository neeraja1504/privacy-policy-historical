Information Collected through Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology
Comic Book RoundUp and our business partners' websites use "cookies" and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tags, scripts and device identifiers). We may receive reports from business partners based on use of these technologies. These reports may provide this information on an individual as well as on an aggregated basis.
1. Cookies
A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer's memory temporarily and automatically deleted when you close your browser (a session cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a persistent cookie) by a web page server. A persistent cookie is not deleted when the browser is closed. Comic Book RoundUp uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. Comic Book RoundUp cookies do not save any personal information. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please refer to your web browser for more information. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Comic Book RoundUp websites and services that depend on cookies.
2. Web Beacons
A "web beacon" is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email. Our business partners use web beacons on our websites, in our emails, in our advertisements on other websites (including social media), and in our advertisements contained in third party emails sent to you. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising in various ways for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our websites from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our websites after viewing a particular advertisement as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded. This helps us send more relevant advertisements to our users and on the websites most visited by you. Unlike cookies, you cannot decline web beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies may help prevent web beacons tracking your activity.
