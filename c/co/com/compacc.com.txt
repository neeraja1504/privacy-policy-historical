Competition Accessories believes in your right to security and privacy. The document below is an outline of the information our site gathers and how it is used.
Personal Information:
The personal information you provide to Competition Accessories will not be sold or given to any other companies or businesses, and we treat your personal information as confidential. We use the information you provide us in a variety of ways. Your information will not only help us to get to know you better, but will also allow us offer you products more suited to your riding style. In addition, we will be able to process and ship your orders quicker, and automatically register you in all of our contests, sweepstakes, and promotional events.  Although Competition Accessories does not specifically seek to obtain any information from children, there are certain areas of our website that children are able to visit. We urge children to provide us with information only after they have discussed it with their parents.
E-mail:
Competition Accessories does not "rent out" our customers' e-mail addresses to third parties for unsolicited e-mail communications. From time to time, we send out e-mails providing our customers with the latest information that we think they will find useful, including information about our new products and services.
You may OPT-OUT of emails or catalog mailings at any time by simply opting out of the e-mails we send or by emailing us at supervisors@compacc.com or using the Contact US section on the site.  Additionally you may call customer service at 1-855-518-6681.
Cookies:
In order for Competition Accessories to customize your visit to our site, we may use "cookies". A cookie is a small piece of data that most browsers accept and store on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way. We use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the site. Browsers are designed so that we cannot look at the cookies of other sites and they cannot look at ours. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, however, you can set your browser to "disable" cookies. You will still be able to order from Competition Accessories, but you may miss out on many of our special features.
On-line Security:
Competition Accessories understands customer concerns when it comes to safety on the Internet. We guarantee that each purchase you make is safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not be held responsible for reimbursement. The credit card information that you provide during the checkout process is encrypted using the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology provided by Verisign. This protection means that it is actually safer for our customers to use their credit cards over the Internet rather than in a retail establishment where credit card numbers appear on hard copies and receipts. When your browser is in "secure mode", an unbroken key or padlock icon will appear at the bottom of your browser window.
