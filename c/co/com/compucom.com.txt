Sites Covered by This Privacy Policy
CompuCom has corporate presence world-wide, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that span across borders. Except with respect to the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks (which are applicable only to websites and domains operated by CompuCom Systems, Inc.), this Privacy Policy applies to all CompuCom-owned websites and domains.
EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks

CompuCom Systems, Inc. is subject to the jurisdiction, and investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Personal information we collect under the Privacy Shield Frameworks includes contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address, as well as billing and transaction information such as your credit card number, order details, and user IDs and passwords for accessing our websites. We collect and use this personal information to: assist you in connection with a transaction or order; communicate with you about products and services; provide service and support; update you on services and benefits; provide personalized promotional offers; select content to be communicated to you; and/or prevent and detect fraud or other malicious activity. Any credit card information we collect is used solely for processing payments and is not used for any other purpose.
We may disclose certain types of your personal information to third-party service providers who provide services directly to us for our own purposes, and we may disclose registration information (name and contact information) to our business partners for use in connection with a joint marketing campaign with that business partner. For additional information on disclosures, generally, please see the section titled “Sharing of Your Personal Information,” below.
We may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and/or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield, CompuCom Systems, Inc. is potentially liable.
If your personal information is subject to the Privacy Shield Principles you have the right to access that information (as well as information about its processing, recipients of that information, and categories of information involved), and to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Principles (except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy for the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than yourself would be violated).
With respect to sharing of data described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, you have the right under the Privacy Shield Principles to opt out of: our sharing of personal information with third parties for purposes other than their performance of services for us and on our behalf, use of your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected from you or subsequently authorized by you, and use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Return email: We use email addresses to answer the email we receive.

Email addresses obtained from events: To market our products and services, we use email addresses obtained through business reply cards and forms at events (for example, seminars). If you receive an email from us following such an event, we may provide a "message reply" option for you to elect not to receive future email messages related to our product and service promotions (or you may always email us at PrivacySupport@compucom.com).
We will obtain express or implied consent from you before contacting you whenever we are required to do so by law (such as the Canadian “anti-spam” law).

Sharing of Your Personal Information
CompuCom will not sell, rent or lease your personal information, or share it with others, except as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
Other than sharing within the CompuCom family of companies, CompuCom will not disclose an individual's personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true:
CompuCom has the individual's permission to make the disclosure;
the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business;
the disclosure is to persons or entities providing services on CompuCom's or the individual's behalf; or
the disclosure is to a business partner and consists of registration information (name and contact information) submitted in connection with a joint marketing campaign with that business partner.
CompuCom may share your information to protect the safety, property, or other rights of CompuCom, its affiliates, customers, or employees, or when we believe that the law requires it. We will share your information:
when release is required by law or regulation, or is otherwise required to be produced to a government agency (for example, in response to a subpoena);
when the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or CompuCom’s defense of legal claims; or
upon discovery of potential fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices, to a governmental agency that we believe should be notified.
Note that CompuCom may share aggregate information (not personally identifiable) with our business partners. For example, CompuCom may inform a business partner that a certain number of individuals visited a certain area on our website or that a certain number filled out a registration form.
Links to Other Sites
If, when you are on a CompuCom website, you choose to navigate to other sites, remember that those sites are not under our control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or collect personal information from or about you. If the CompuCom website provides a link to any third-party website, we make no representation or warranty as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of the third party's privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any third-party website before submitting your personal information to it.
We may also provide social media features that enable you to share information with social networks and to interact with CompuCom on various social media sites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites. Actions you take in connection with social media features may be reflected in a manner visible to others; for example, if you “Like” us on Facebook, others may be able to see that you have done so.
No Use by Children Under the Age of 18
We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of minors under the age of 18, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and California’s statute titled “Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World.”
Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to use CompuCom sites without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to place orders or provide personal information through CompuCom sites. If we learn that someone under the age of 18 has provided any personal information through at CompuCom site, we will remove and delete that information as soon as reasonably possible.
If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your minor under the age of 18 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact PrivacySupport@compucom.com. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, we will cooperate with you to discuss what, if any, personal information we may have about your child and how that information may have been shared or used.
Your California Privacy Rights

Such a request may be made by sending an email message to PrivacySupport@compucom.com with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line of the message. In response to such a request, we will provide information as required by the California law for the previous calendar year concerning such other businesses and the categories of personal information, if any, that we have shared with them.
