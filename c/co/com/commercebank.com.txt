In addition, in certain circumstances we disclose nonpublic personal information about you to "nonaffiliated third parties" (i.e., third parties that are not members of our corporate family) as permitted by law. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties as necessary to process transactions that you have requested or authorized, to government entities in response to subpoenas and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to any other nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law.

Your Choice to Limit Marketing
One of the benefits of doing business with Commerce Bank and its Affiliates is the opportunity to effectively meet most of your financial needs – all in one place. We can do this by having our own brokerage and mortgage Affiliates, as well as student loan, trust and other financial services under one roof. This is the family of Commerce Bank companies, and through this corporate family we’re often able to offer you better value and convenience.
We understand that your time is limited and you are interested only in products that can provide a potential benefit to you. For that reason, we limit our marketing contacts to those complementary Commerce products and services that our research has shown may be of interest to you.
Commerce Bank and its Affiliates are providing this notice.
Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all marketing from our Affiliates. Federal law also requires us to give you this notice to tell you about your choice to limit marketing from our Affiliates.
You may limit our Affiliates, such as our trust, mortgage, insurance and brokerage Affiliates, from marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information includes your income, your account history with us and your credit score. Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliates will apply until you tell us to change your choice. If you have already made a choice to limit marketing offers from our Affiliates, you do not need to act again.
To limit marketing offers, contact us toll-free at 1-800-543-4845.
