Cookies
A “cookie” is a small text file that is transferred to your browser and stores information about your interactions with a particular website.  A cookie is then read by the Web server that placed it on your browser.  It works as a sort of identification card, recording your preferences and recalling previously entered information.  By using cookies, your navigation time is reduced and use of a website is simplified.
Compuware uses two types of cookies:
A “ session ” cookie is temporary and is deleted once you close your browser. Session cookies are used to help a user’s browser navigate a website more smoothly and may show up if the user comes from a website with which the subsequent website has some relationship (e.g., the website of an affiliated company).  Session cookies can also give helpful information.
A “ persistent” cookie is more permanent and is stored on the hard drive of your computer.  Persistent cookies are used to customize a website for a user.  They may store passwords, preferences, registration and account information so that users do not have to re-enter this information each time they visit the website.
A cookie cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  Compuware uses both session and persistent cookies to collect and store information that allows us to offer better customer service and ensure easy navigation through our website(s).
You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. In most cases, if you do not accept the cookie you are still able to use the site. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit this site.
Opt-Out
Compuware provides the opportunity to opt-out of receiving its communications whenever we request personal information from you and when you receive material from us. If you have difficulty opting-out, you can go to the Compuware Unsubscribe page or e-mail unsubscribe@compuware.com and provide your name, e-mail address and subscription you wish to cancel.
