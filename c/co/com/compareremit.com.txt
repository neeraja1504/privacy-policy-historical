Privacy Policy
SCOPE
This Privacy Policy explains the practices of Path2USA.com Inc. (“CompareRemit”, “we”, “us” or “our”) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you access and use our website located at compareremit.com (the “Site”), or our remittance comparison mobile device application (the “App” and together with the Site, the “Services”) or through contacting us by telephone or other form of communication. This Privacy Policy applies only to CompareRemit’s remittance comparison and exchange rate tracking offerings and doesn’t apply to any of our other offerings or any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.
By using or accessing our Services, you give us your consent to collect store and process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy (except in certain cases described below, where you may specifically opt out of certain uses of your personal data). If you do not wish to allow us to do so, please do not use our Services. If you wish us to stop collecting and processing your personal data, please contact us as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT
Personal data means any information about an individual person from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed, i.e. anonymous data.
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
Identity Data includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, and country and/or state of residency.
Contact Data includes your email address.
Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, device version, and other technology on the devices you use to access our Site or on which you run our App.
Profile Data includes your interests, preferences, feedback, survey responses, and the reviews or other commentary you contribute to the Services
Usage Data includes information about how you use our Services.
Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences. This also includes us making a note of conversations we have had with you in person and/or communications you sent to us. This helps us to manage our relationship with you and ensures you only receive communications from us that are relevant and timely.
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Service feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
HOW WE COLLECT YOUR DATA
We collect different information about you in a number of ways:
Information you give us
When you sign up for our marketing communications, post a review or other commentary on our website, or contact us to ask a question or give us feedback, we will store the personal data you give to us such as your name, email address, and other details. We will also keep a record of our communications with you (including information like your survey responses and the reviews or other commentary).
Automated technologies or interactions
As you interact with our Services, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies.

Analytics providers such as (by way of example only) Google
Advertising networks such as (by way of example only) Facebook or Quora
Publishers who run our advertisements on their websites or mobile apps
Search information advertising providers such as Google AdWords
HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to.
Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Where we have your explicit consent before using your personal data in that specific situation. However, generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data and you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us (or by using any other mechanism we provide, such as an “unsubscribe” link in an email). You will find the relevant contact details at the end of this policy.

Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.
Finally, while the table below describes our practices, we do not use any personal data (in any of the categories we have identified) relating to individuals in the European Economic Area for any marketing communications or advertising unless such individuals have opted in to receive marketing communications or advertising from us.

These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon.

You may also disable Web beacons by disabling HTML images in your email program, which may also affect other images in emails you receive.
