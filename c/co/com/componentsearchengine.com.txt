This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 1, 2019.
SamacSys, Ltd. (“SamacSys,” “we,” or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting and using the SamacSys Offerings or registering for the SamacSys Offerings and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the SamacSys Terms of Service that you can find at https://componentsearchengine.com/TermsOfUse.html and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes SamacSys’s practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the SamacSys Offerings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that SamacSys does not own or control or that do not support SamacSys in providing the SamacSys Offerings.
“Personal Information” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
“Anonymous Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.
We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the SamacSys Offerings (“Users”).
BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.
General Information
As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Information hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Information. However, there are circumstances in which SamacSys cannot take action without certain Personal Information, for example because this Personal Information is required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for SamacSys to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Information.
As part of a global group of companies, SamacSys has affiliates and third-party service providers within, as well as outside of, the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). As a consequence, whenever SamacSys is using or otherwise processing your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, SamacSys may transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA.
You can request from SamacSys at any time details about which Personal Information SamacSys processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Information. Please note, however, that SamacSys can delete your Personal Information only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SamacSys to retain it. If you request that SamacSys delete your Personal Information, you will not be able to continue to use any SamacSys service that requires SamacSys’s use of your Personal Information.
If SamacSys uses your Personal Information based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from SamacSys a copy of the Personal Information that you have provided to SamacSys. In this case, please contact the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like this information, and whether the Personal Information is to be sent to you or another recipient. SamacSys will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how we can best fulfill it.
Furthermore, you can request from SamacSys that we restrict your Personal Information from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Information SamacSys has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as SamacSys requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Information), (ii) there is no legal basis for SamacSys processing your Personal Information and you demand that SamacSys restricts your Personal Information from further processing, (iii) SamacSys no longer requires your Personal Information but you claim that you require SamacSys to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Information by SamacSys (based on SamacSys’s legitimate interest as further set out below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether SamacSys has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Information.
Please direct any such request to legal@SamacSys.com.
Right To Lodge A Complaint
If you believe that SamacSys is not processing your Personal Information in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which SamacSys has its registered seat.

We may use your email address to confirm your opening of an account, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, which are not marketing-related but merely required for the relevant business relationship. With regard to marketing-related types of communication (i.e. emails and phone calls), SamacSys will provide you the opportunity to opt out if you do not want to receive further marketing-related types of communication from us.
SamacSys and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes issued by these countries, SamacSys is required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through SamacSys Sites or other delivery channels controlled by SamacSys. This may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists; (ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information; (iii) blocking of access to SamacSys’s services and systems in case of a potential match; and (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match.
Furthermore, you acknowledge that any information required to track your choices regarding the processing or use of your Personal Information or receipt of marketing materials (that is to say, depending on the country in which the relevant SamacSys company operates, whether you have expressly consented to or opted out of receiving marketing materials) may be stored and exchanged between members of SamacSys as required to ensure compliance.
Uses Of My Personal Information Based On My Consent
In the following cases SamacSys will only use your Personal Information as further detailed below after you have granted your prior consent into the relevant processing operations.
SamacSys may provide a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google) where this information is then matched against the social networks’ data or the web offerings’ own data bases in order to display to you more relevant information.
SamacSys offers you the option to use its Offerings including forums, blogs, and networks linked to its Sites that require you to register and create a user profile. User profiles provide the option to display personal information about you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company.
These profiles may relate to a single Offering of SamacSys or may also allow you to access other Offerings of SamacSys or of other entities of SamacSys, or both (irrespective of any consent granted under the section “Forwarding Your Personal Data To Other SamacSys Companies.” below). It is, however, always your choice which of these additional Offerings you use and your Personal Information is only forwarded to them once you initially access them. Kindly note that without your consent for SamacSys to create such user profiles, SamacSys will not be in a position to offer such services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that SamacSys can provide these services to you.
Within any Offerings, beyond the mere provision of access, your profile is used to personalize interaction with other users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and by SamacSys to foster the quality of communication and collaboration through such Offerings and for SamacSys to provide gamification elements (gamification is the process of taking something that already exists, such as a website, an enterprise application, or an online community, and integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty). To the greatest extent supported by the relevant Offerings, you can use the functionality of the relevant Offerings to determine which information you want to share.
Special categories of Personal Information. In connection with the registration for and provision of access to an event or seminar, SamacSys may ask for information about your health for the purpose of identifying and being considerate of individuals who have disabilities or special dietary requirements throughout the event. Any such use of information is based on the consent you grant hereunder.
Kindly note that if you do not provide any such information about disabilities or special dietary requirements, SamacSys will not be able to take any respective precautions.
If you register for an event, seminar, or webinar of SamacSys, SamacSys may share basic participant information (your name, company, and email address) with other participants of the same event, seminar, or webinar for the purpose of communication and the exchange of ideas.
SamacSys may transfer your Personal Information to other entities owned by SamacSys. In such cases, these entities will then use the Personal Information for the same purposes and under the same conditions as outlined in this section.
You may at any time withdraw a consent granted.  In case of withdrawal, SamacSys will not process Personal Information subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case SamacSys is required to retain your Personal Information for legal reasons your Personal Information will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law. However, any withdrawal has no effect on past processing of Personal Information by SamacSys up to the point in time of your withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of an SamacSys Offering requires your prior consent, SamacSys will not be (any longer) able to provide the relevant service, offer or event to you after your revocation.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
In the event SamacSys goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SamacSys or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to SamacSys sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.
We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, other Users, or third parties.

You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you may have with us. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your Account information (and associated Content) from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the SamacSys Offerings. SamacSys will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your Account or related deletion of your information.
