Privacy Policy | ComputerValley.ca
Our Privacy Commitment
At ComputerValley.ca we know how important it is to protect your personal information. When you are shopping with us online we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
This Policy applies to our Web Site and all other channels in which ComputerValley.ca collects and uses your personal information.
** What Information does ComputerValley.ca Collect?** _
_At ComputerValley.ca, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.
Personal information
Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:
your contact information � e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;
your personal preferences � e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and
your transaction information � e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.
Non-personal information
Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:
we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;
we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or
we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.
All references to �Web Sites� in this Privacy Policy mean www.computervalley.ca or other ComputerValley.ca provided Web sites.
You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a ComputerValley.ca credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.
How is Your Personal Information Used? _
_ComputerValley.ca may use your personal information for a number of different business purposes, for example to:
fulfill your specific requests for products, services or information;
provide customer support to assist you with your questions or complaints;
conduct surveys in order to improve our services;
measure and improve the effectiveness of our Web Sites or our marketing endeavors;
detect and protect against fraud and error;
track and analyze your purchases and preferences to better understand your product and service needs and eligibility;
tailor our online content or in-store offerings based on your preferences;
if you ask us, to offer and promote additional products and services we offer; and
for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.
Your Consent _
_ComputerValley.ca will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by law. When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.
Express Consent
Sometimes you will be asked to give your express consent, such as by checking a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications, or by providing your signature to indicate your acceptance of the use and disclosure terms presented on an application form.
Implied Consent
Other times, we may obtain your consent implicitly when we can reasonably conclude that you�ve given consent by some action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take. Generally, this occurs where the purpose for use of your personal information would be reasonably apparent to you.
Withdrawing Your Consent
You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure or your information. We will accommodate your request subject to legal and contractual restrictions related to your transactions.
If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example, each e-newsletter we send to you will include a link or other method to unsubscribe or decline further e-newsletters.
Information ComputerValley.ca Collects Directly from You _
_Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.
Returns and Exchanges
Our goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, ComputerValley.ca offers a Return Policy. For ComputerValley.ca to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud. You may also be asked to produce photo ID for verification purposes only.
ReClaim Insurance Replacement
When working with our ReClaim Consultants to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for you.
Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys
Following a purchase from some of our departments we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or installation of your new product. We may use contact information collected online, or via our call centre to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.
Our Web Sites
Our Web Sites can be browsed anonymously. However, to engage in certain special features or functions of our Web Sites, or to order products and services from our Web Sites, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as online forums.
Online Forums and Customer Reviews
Certain pages of our Web Sites, such as �Community Forum�, facilitate interactive discussions between users and ComputerValley.ca staff or agents acting on our behalf regarding products and services available for purchase through the Web Sites. The Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to share your thoughts on a product. These public forums and reviews are accessible to all Web Site visitors so please use discretion when posting information to them and do not post personal information.
Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates
ComputerValley.ca also offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications. Should you choose to enrol we will collect your contact information, such as name and email address. This information will only be used to send you the newsletter and promotional announcements that you have requested. You may �unsubscribe� at any time by using the unsubscribe link included in the footer of the newsletter or by using the unsubscribe link included below under the heading �Unsubscribe�. Our subscriber list is never sold or rented to other parties.
Participate in a Contest or Promotion
From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences). Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules that will be available with each particular campaign. Some contests are conducted by third parties and will be subject to the third party�s policies.
Tell a Friend
While visiting our Web Sites you may choose to use the �Tell a Friend� tool which allows you to inform a friend about products of interest to you. The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the �Tell a Friend� tool you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this correspondence and not ComputerValley.ca. If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.
Subscription Services and Activations
ComputerValley.ca may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so a government-issued ID number and your credit card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.
Call Centre
ComputerValley.ca operates customer support call centre to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints. When you contact our call centre, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity. For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.
** Information ComputerValley.ca Collects Automatically** _

This information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes and to improve the Web Sites.
Cookies
The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your language preference every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.
Web Site Tracking Information
We may use web beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases. We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. For our own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Links to Other Web Sites
Our Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources which are provided solely for your convenience and information.

Service Providers
ComputerValley.ca may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
