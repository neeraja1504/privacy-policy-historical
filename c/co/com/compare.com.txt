Privacy Statement | Compare.com
As a valued visitor and user of our site, Compare.com, your happiness with our service and trust in our ability to provide that service to you is very important to us. For that reason, we take our security seriously and we respect your right to privacy. Below you’ll find details about our policy regarding your privacy on our site. Please be aware that this privacy policy only applies to Compare.com. Should you navigate to a site other than Compare.com, you will be subject to that site’s privacy policy and our policy will cease to be in effect. We would like to make you aware that you may be contacted by one of our partners. These partners could include the insurance company which you showed an interest in purchasing from, the one that provided you the lowest rate, or a partner who has additional savings opportunities or product offerings for you.
Please be aware that by your continued use of Compare.com, you consent to the terms stated in this privacy policy. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to Contact Us.
That’s the nutshell version. Below you’ll find the nuts-and-bolts and some of that legalese we know you’re dying to read, as well as more detailed information on emails we send, our security, and things you might like to know about your personal information and our partners.
Information We Collect and How It’s Used
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected and used as part of the quote process. Some of this information may be collected from persons other than the individual or individuals proposed for coverage. We collect this information and relay it to our list of insurance providers to present you, the user, with accurate quotes for a car insurance product, as well as to report to our marketing partners on the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Please be aware, however, that this disclosure may occur without your specific authorization.
This data is stored in our secure database so that you can return to Compare.com at any time and get a new quote, minimizing the amount of information you’ll enter on your return visit. This feature is optional and we’ll only use your information on your return visit if you ask us to. Your consent is granted by providing your email address, which serves as your login for return visits. We and/or our partners may also reach out to you to remind you about your renewal or to inform you about additional saving opportunities or product offerings. A right of access and a right to correct your personal information exists. A more detailed notice providing information about our insurance information practices, including your right to access and to correct your information, will be provided to you upon request.
A user account will be automatically created for you with your email address. Compare.com will email and/or text/SMS a link that will allow you to set up your account access, with the email account and/or phone number that you provide. Once you have received quotes, you will be able to retrieve and/or update them through your user account.
Compare.com will also contact you on occasion to ask for your feedback, provide you with information, send reminders about quotes in progress, or potential renewal rates for which you may be entitled. We may also share your information with advertisers to allow them to show you advertisements. We promise to keep it to a bare minimum, but if you’d prefer not to receive emails, text messages/SMS, phone calls, or any other communications from Compare.com or our partners, we do provide you with the option of unsubscribing, or opting out of our communications at any time through the settings tab on the User Account page. We’d like you to know that our communications are geared toward helping you, not filling your inbox with an avalanche of junk mail.

Collecting information to develop new services for our users

Tracking cookies may be turned off from within the Settings menu of your web browser.
