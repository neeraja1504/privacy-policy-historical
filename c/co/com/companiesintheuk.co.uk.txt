Who are we and what we do
CompaniesInTheUK (CUK) provides information on UK Companies. We hope that this information will lead to better and more transparent relationships with your suppliers.
CUK monitors a number of publicly available data sources for this Company information. We correlate and cross reference the information from these sources, and present an overall view of the company’s profile, it’s directors and financial status.
Some of this information may be classed as ‘person data’ under European Union (EU) law because it relates to a natural person, such as who the director of a company is. We are required to provide this privacy notice on how we process this personal data under EU law.
Note that the EU GDPR privacy laws and UK Data Protection Act only relate to the protection of ‘natural persons’ i.e. People, as opposed to ‘legal persons’, which are business entities i.e. Companies. We do not remove companies from our database, and we will decline any requests asking for ‘my company’ to be removed from our website due to GDPR or UK Data Protection legislation.
