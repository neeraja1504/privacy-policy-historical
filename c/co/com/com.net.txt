We do not collect the email addresses of users who do not establish accounts (i.e. with username and password) with us. We do reply to inquiries made by email; such emails may contain incorrect reply addresses: due to limitations of the Internet email system ("return address spoofing"), we are unable to determine when this has occurred, however such a reply message would only occur once per inquiry.
