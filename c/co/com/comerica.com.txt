Privacy Notice | Comerica
​Effective date: January 1, 2014
Online Privacy Practices​
These Online Privacy Practices only relate to the information we collect online. See below for our general privacy notice applicable to consumers as required by federal law. How we handle information about you when you visit our website will depend on what you do when visiting comerica.com and other websites owned by Comerica Bank.
Customer information
Solely Visiting Our Website
If you visit our website to solely read information and do not use any of our online services (offered to non-customers and/or customers), then we collect and store only the name of the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our website, Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website and your zip code.  We may record the “IP address” assigned to you by your internet service provider as part of this process. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to different sections of our site, and to help make our website more useful to visitors.
Using Our Services
We recommend that when you complete your online transactions to log off completely before visiting other sites and/or restart your personal computer.  This may clear your cookies (see “Cookies” discussion below).  We also recommend that you do not visit other sites during your online banking session with us.
When you visit our website and use our website to engage in account opening or electronic banking services (e.g. Comerica Web Banking®), then there may be times when you are asked to provide information about you that is personally identifiable (“Personal Information”).  This may include the following:
Personal
your first, middle and last name,

your e-mail address,
a telephone number,
social security number,
account number,
date of birth,
mother’s maiden name,
password or any other identifier that permits physical or online contact with you, and

Available Down Payment Amount.
Other
Account Preferences,

Please note that user IDs, personal IDs, passwords, and PINs along with tokens or challenge/security questions would be provided by you only in connection with you opening or logging onto one or more of our services or when you set up and use an aggregation service that allows you to consolidate your financial account information from a variety of sources.  Comerica Bank would never request personal information (e.g. social security number, user IDs, or passwords) via unsolicited e-mail.  Be cautious when clicking on links in e-mails or responding to e-mails you have received, particularly when the message is urgent or threatening.  By doing so, you may unwittingly downloaded viruses or spyware that may cause you to be redirected to a fraudulent site, even when you type in a legitimate site address, such as comerica.com/privacy.  If you are concerned that an e-mail you have received may not be from Comerica, then please send the suspicious e-mail to us at ReportFraud@comerica.com.
Personal information might be needed or requested from you for you to be able to open deposit accounts online or to register for online banking and other services, or to fill out our forms or applications for services for special promotions or contests, or to accomplish transactions you request.  This may result in sharing Personal Information with third parties (such as data processors or service bureaus) as part of servicing your accounts or transactions.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies
As mentioned above, we collect information from your online visits to our website and your use of our online banking services to help gather statistics about usage and effectiveness, personalize your experiences and tailor our interactions with you.  We do so through the use of various technologies, including the use of cookies, web beacons and other use-tracking devices.​
Definitions
Cookies.   A “cookie” is generally a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user’s web browser while the user is browsing the internet.  A “session cookie” is a cookie that exists in temporary memory only while the user is reading and navigating a particular website.  A session cookie is typically deleted when the user closes his or her browser.  A “persistent cookie” is a cookie that generally outlasts the user’s current online session and may be sent back to the server every time the user visits the same website.  Persistent cookies are commonly referred to as “tracking cookies” since the user’s activity on a particular website may be tracked over time.
​Web Beacons .  A “web beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or e-mail and is usually invisible to the user but allows checking that a user has viewed the page or e-mail.  It is basically a technique to track who is reading a web page or e-mail. A web beacons, also called “web bugs” are often invisible to the user because they may be very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and/or are made to blend in with the background color of the webpage, document, or e-mail message.  Web bugs are identified with HTML IMG tags in the webpage.
Use of Cookies
Cookies help websites keep track of your preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor.  When you return to a website you have visited before, your browser gives the information stored in the cookie back to the website’s server. For example, in addition to other information, www.comerica.com may use a cookie to save your zip code location selection so that we can present product and service information that is available in your area. Additionally, we may use cookies to facilitate online surveys, to track how visitors use our site, or to deliver our products and services to you.  We use this information to improve the content, usability and functionality of our website.  Recording information in a cookie allows us to simplify and personalize your online experience, as well as delivering our products and services to you.  We generally use both session and persistent cookies.
You may choose to set your browser to reject cookies.  However, we do not recommend disabling cookies on our website because you may not be able to log in or use basic features on our website such as Comerica Web Banking®.  For more information see the "Help" information for the browser you are using.  If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set your internet browser to refuse cookies before accessing our site, with the understanding that certain features of the site may not function properly without the aid of cookies. If you refuse cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.  Please see the heading “Our Response to Web Browser Do Not Track and Other Similar Mechanisms” below for further information.
Use of Web Beacons
With the assistance of a cookie, web bugs may collect the IP address of your computer, the URL of the page the web bugs comes from and the time it was viewed, or other personal information. For example, web bugs may add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile.  Another use of web bugs is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular website and to gather statistics about web browser usage at different places on the Internet. You may use the "view profiles" of the webpage you are viewing on our website to see whether the page is using a web bug.
Use of Other Technologies
Comerica may use other use-tracking devices, which may change from time-to-time as technology changes, to help diagnose problems and to administer our website.  We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our website design.
​
Our website may include advertisements for third parties and their products, and those third-party advertisements and websites may include a cookie, web bugs, or other device of the third party.  Comerica does not have control over the cookies, web bugs, or other devices used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect.
If you visit our website or engage in any online service that we offer, then we may collect and store the categories of Personal Information.  We will not share the Personal Information you provide us at our website with a third party, except as described below under the heading “Categories of Third Parties with Whom Comerica May Share Information.”
Our Response to Web Browser Do Not Track and Other Similar Mechanisms
You may set your web browser to disable the ability for one or more websites to track your usage.  For example, as stated above under the heading “Use of Cookies,” you may choose to set your browser to reject cookies.  We will respect any disabled cookies as a do not track mechanism that provides you a choice regarding the collection of Personal Information when you visit or conduct online activity on our websites regardless of whether your visit or online activity is a one-off occurrence or occurs over time.  However, we may not be able to respond or take any action when it comes to other “do not track” technologies due to technology and industry standards constantly evolving.  Also, we are unable to respond or take any action when you access third party websites or online services.  Further, please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other tracking mechanisms, then your experience using our online services may not be the same depending on the particular service.  Specifically, functionality of a service may be limited, may not function properly, or may not work at all. These functionalities include, but are not limited to, settings as to screen size and appearance, logon verification, and pre-populated information.
Other Parties May Collect Personal Information
Other parties that may collect personal information about you when you use one or more of our websites once or over time are generally limited to service providers with whom Comerica Bank may share in order to administer, process or service the product or service you are using online.
Categories of Third Parties with Whom Comerica Bank May Share Information
Presently, Comerica Bank discloses Personal Information to third-party persons about our customers or former customers only as permitted by law in connection with the administration, processing or servicing of accounts.
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties and our marketing partners except as permitted by law to those third party persons or entities that perform services for us on your behalf.  This may also include disclosure to protect against fraud, or as part of an audit or examination; and disclosure to protect and defend our rights and property or to act in an emergency or to protect someone’s safety.
As we develop our business, we may also buy and sell assets, and your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.  In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
Please be aware that other services, provided by other companies via links to their website from Comerica’s website, are not subject to these Online Privacy Practices.  We encourage you to review third party service providers’ privacy policies before sharing your Personal Information.
