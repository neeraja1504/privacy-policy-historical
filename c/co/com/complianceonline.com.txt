We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third parties process personal data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.
Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of third parties who perform services on our behalf in connection with their handling of personal data that we transfer to them(including where we transfer personal data to them pursuant to the Privacy Shield).
