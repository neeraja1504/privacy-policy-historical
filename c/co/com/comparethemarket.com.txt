Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will have a contract in place with them placing obligations on them to keep your data secure and only use it for the purposes that we authorise. The third parties that we use may include, for example, IT service providers and market research agencies.
Where our insurance partners and comparison service partners collect data from
In order to provide you with a quote for comparison, our insurance partners and/or comparison service partners will exchange information about you with other companies and/or carry out checks with various databases. These checks are standard practice in the insurance and financial services industries. Each of our insurance partners or comparison service partner is a data controller in respect of these checks and we are not responsible for those checks. We have set out below some of the common databases that they may check.
Checks against existing records
Some of our insurance partners may carry out checks against data they already hold on your (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data. They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums. They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.
DVLA
Where we ask you for your, or any named driver's, driving licence number, we will pass this to our insurance partners who may pass this to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data.
Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and ensure policy premiums are fair. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or your named driver's) driving licence record.
For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit www.dvla.gov.uk.
Credit searches
Many of our insurance partners will carry out checks with credit reference agencies when they generate a quote for comparison. These checks may include-
checks against publicly available information such as the Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information;
checks against data relating to your credit history. Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud. Our insurance partners may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation. Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application. A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained and this together with other factors will be used to assess your application for a quote.
The Credit Reference Agencies will keep a record of the search and you may see this recorded on your credit file. The name of the company that carried out the search will be stated on your credit search and if you have any queries regarding any search that has been carried out you will need to contact the company directly. If you want to check the information that the Credit Reference Agencies hold about you then you can contact them directly. The main credit reference agencies are Call Credit, Experian and Equifax.
Claims and Underwriting Exchange and Other Registers and Databases
Our insurance partners will exchange information with various databases and registers to help them to check information provided, to detect and prevent crime or fraud and to obtain information about your no claims history. These may include the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, the Hunter Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, the No Claims History Database and any other relevant industry databases or registers. Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.
Publicly available sources
We use some open sources of data which are not personal data (such as information about particular geographic areas) and combine this with the personal data that we hold about you (such as your own address). For example, if you request a home insurance quote, we might pre-populate information about your house value from publicly available sources. We will make it clear where we do this and you must check the information to make sure it is correct. This information will be passed to our insurance partners in order to assess insurance risk and provide you with an accurate quote.
Providing data about other people
You will sometimes need to provide us with data about other people, for example where you request a quote for a policy which includes another person as a joint policyholder or named driver. You may also obtain quotes on behalf of your family or friends. Where you give us data about someone else, you must make sure that you have made that person aware of this Privacy Policy and that they are happy for you to provide their data.

If you consent to us contacting you for marketing purposes, we will disclose an anonymised version of your email address (we use a process called hashing to protect your details) to third party social media sites such as Facebook to enable us to display marketing to you via such sites. "Hashing" is similar to encryption and means that we scramble the plain text of your email address to create a unique and irreversible message.

Your personal data will also be used to assist us and our approved advertising providers with our advertising activities, as set out in more detail in the "Targeting Cookies" section of our Cookies Policy.

Your name, email and password are used to log you into the App and to link you to your comparethemarket.com account to check your eligibility for Rewards and that your membership is valid and has not expired.
Your name is also used to personalise any messages that we send to you through the App.
If you have agreed to receive messages from us, we will either use your device information to send you push messages (where you have opted in specifically to receiving push messages), or we will send in-app messages to you, for example to ask you to review the App.
If you have agreed to receive marketing from us we will use your device information to notify you of information, products or services that we think may be of interest to you based on your previous use of the App, such as the release of a new film or a change in the participating restaurants for Meerkat Meals.
We will use information about your account to send you service messages relating to your account, for example to let you know if your Rewards are about to expire.
When you first log into the App, you will be asked if you are happy to allow location services. This means that we are sent information by your device about your location. You can turn this setting on and off any time using your device's settings. If you have consented to the use of location services, we will use your location to show you information about which restaurants or cinemas are nearby. We will also use this information to identify when you enter a particular location. For example, we will use this location information to identify when you enter a cinema or restaurant.  We’ll use this information to give us insight as to how you use your Rewards and may also use this information to send you more tailored messages for example reminding you to use your voucher code.
How long do we keep data?
We'll only keep your personal data as long as we need it and ensure it is securely destroyed when it is no longer required. We do however need to keep certain data after we have provided you with your quotes for certain periods as detailed below.
Generally, you can expect us to keep your data for a period of 5 years from when you obtain your quote. If you have an account with us we will keep your data while your account with us is active and then if you stop using your account we will generally retain your data for a period of 5 years from that point (unless there is a requirement for us to keep the data for longer, for example if there are any ongoing queries or claims relating to your quotes).
We keep data for these periods as it plays an important part in allowing us to undertake fraud detection and prevention activities, allows us to deal with any queries or complaints that may arise regarding quotes that have been provided and allow us to carry out research and analysis to help us improve our products and services (as described in the section headed "What do we use your data for?" above).
Any of our partners who process your data to provide a quote should only keep the data for as long as is necessary in relation to the quote they have provided. If you take out a policy with one of our insurance partners, that partner will keep your personal data in line with its own retention periods and you should check that insurance partner's Privacy Policy for further information.
If you use the 'Your Documents' facility we will keep your documents for a period of 5 years from the date you last used the account as described above.
Overseas Transfer of Data
We use third party suppliers to process limited personal data about you. Some of these suppliers may be located in countries outside the UK which may not have equivalent laws in place to protect your personal data. For example, we use third party software suppliers such as Microsoft to process data such as your IP address and email address, which Microsoft stores in the USA.
Whenever we do use third party suppliers to process personal data about you outside the UK, we will ensure that your personal data is kept securely, is only used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and is afforded equivalent protection as it would be if it were processed in the UK. We do this through various mechanisms, for example making sure that European Commission approved contractual clauses are in place with the supplier or ensuring that suppliers who process personal data in the USA are signed up to the Privacy Shield arrangement. If you are concerned about our use of third party suppliers to process personal data outside the UK, or if you would like any further information about any of these suppliers, please contact us using the details set out under "Contacting us" below.
Our insurance providers and comparison service providers may also process personal data in countries outside the UK which may not have equivalent laws in place to protect your personal data. Our insurance partners and comparison service partners are the data controllers in respect of any such processing and such processing will be subject to their own Privacy Policies.  We do not have any control over whether our partners or comparison service partners process personal data outside the UK but if this do this they must do it in accordance with data protection legislation.
Your Rights
Data protection law gives you various rights in relation to your personal data. All the rights set out below can be exercised by contacting us using the contact details set out under the "Contacting us" section below. Please note that we can only deal with requests to exercise these rights where they relate to personal data that we process as data controller. If you send us a request which relates to personal data processed by one or more of our partners or comparison service providers as data controllers, we will direct you to the appropriate insurance partner(s) or comparison service provider(s).
Your rights include:-
You have the right to ask us to provide a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. This is called a Data Subject Access Request or "DSAR". You can access information about your quotes by logging into your account. If you want to receive other personal data that we hold then you can make a DSAR. When contacting us please describe the information you require and make sure that you tell us any email addresses you or anyone else have used to obtain quotes with us as this allows us to trace all relevant information. Please also include the following: your full name, your date of birth and your full address. For security purposes we can only deal with requests where the contact details you provide match the details we have on file and we may need to ask you for further information to verify your identity. If you have changed your contact details or you require information sending to different contact details please include a copy of your passport or driving licence and proof of address such as a recent utility bill to assist us in verifying your identity. We might also need to ask you for additional information to help us locate the data that you are looking for. Once we have all the information that we need to process your DSAR, we will respond within one month unless your DSAR is very large or complex, in which case we may need to extend this period. If we need to do this we will let you know. If you want to make a DSAR in relation to personal data that is held by any of our insurance partners then you will need to contact them directly. You can find our list of insurance partners here.
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. If you think any of your personal data is inaccurate, please contact us and, provided we can verify your identity and are satisfied as to the accuracy of the correction requested, we will correct the relevant personal data as soon as we can. You can also amend inaccurate data in your account.
You have the right to request that we provide a copy of your personal data in a machine readable format or to ask us to send your personal data to another company. This applies to personal data that you have provided to us, which we have processed electronically, such as personal data you entered on our website when you obtained a quote.
You also have the right to ask us to delete personal data that we hold about you. We are obliged to delete personal data in some circumstances, such as where it is no longer needed. However, data protection laws allow us to keep the personal data if we need to, for example if the data is needed for fraud prevention.  In any case, we will retain your personal data in line with the retention periods detailed under "How long do we keep data?" above.    If you use the “Your Documents” facility to store your documents, you can delete the documents at any time by selecting the delete option available in the Your Documents section.
You have the right to ask us not to do anything with your personal data except store it in limited circumstances, such as if you and we do not agree on the accuracy of personal data and steps are required to validate it.
You have the right to object to us processing certain personal data about you. However, where we need to continue to process the personal data, for example for fraud prevention purposes, we are not obliged to stop processing it.
You have the right to ask for significant decisions that have been made about you wholly by automated means to be reviewed. We do not make any significant decisions about you wholly by automated means. However, the nature of the quotes provided by our insurance partners means that they have to use this kind of automated decision making to assess your quotes. If you want any wholly automated decisions in relation to your quotes to be reviewed, you will need to contact the partner who has produced the relevant quote.
