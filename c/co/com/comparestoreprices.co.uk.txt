Here is extended Information about Our privacy Policy

CompareStorePrices.co.uk does not automatically collect any personal information about you. We do collect PII, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, geographical location, age and gender, through membership registration, newsletter sign-up requests or promotional contests. Please note that it is not necessary for you to become a member in order to use many of the features on CompareStorePrices.co.uk.com, a non-member can easily see products and prices, perform searches, read reviews and take advantage of many other useful features on the site.
CompareStorePrices.co.uk also operates a free e-newsletter service - the CompareStorePrices.co.uk Update - to help you keep up-to-date with the best deals, contests and CompareStorePrices.co.uk news. This is an opt-in service so, as a member, you will receive the newsletter. To unsubscribe simply send an e-mail to remove@CompareStorePrices.co.uk and include your e-mail address.
The reason that we ask for this PII is to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with any promotions you participate in.
We also use this information for internal business purposes, such as aggregating the data to help us to create a profile of CompareStorePrices.co.uk visitors, as a whole, so that we can; a) build a better understanding of our users and enhance the services we offer, and b) attract advertisers to spend money on CompareStorePrices.co.uk, thus enabling our free price comparison service to operate.
