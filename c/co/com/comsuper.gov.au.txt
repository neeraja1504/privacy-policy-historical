CSC's statutory functions are set out in the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011 and scheme legislation and deeds. CSC, as the trustee of the CSS, MilitarySuper, PSS, PSSap and ADF Super is also required to comply with, for example, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations, the Corporations Act 2001 and regulations, tax legislation and regulations, and the Anti-Money Laundering & Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006.
Collection, holding, use and disclosure of information
Personal information is collected, held, used and disclosed as required or authorised by law, for the purpose of managing the superannuation schemes and member accounts of Australian Government employees and members of the Australian Defence Force for their retirement. This includes the management of superannuation investments, providing superannuation products and information to members, administration of the superannuation schemes and member accounts, conducting market research and product development.
Personal information is primarily provided to CSC directly or through external service providers:
Pillar Administration (Pillar) [ABN 80 976 223 967] provides scheme administration services for the PSSap. This includes processing and administering member accounts, such as receiving employer contributions and maintaining records. Their privacy policy is available at pillar.com.au
AIA Australia Limited (AIA) [ABN 79 004 837 861, AFSL 230043] provides insurance options available to certain PSSap and PSS members. AIA's privacy policy is available at aia.com.au
Industry Fund Services (IFS) [ABN 54 007 016 195, AFSL 232514] provides financial advice to members. IFS's privacy policy is available at ifs.net.au
the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT).
Pillar, AIA and IFS may pass on personal information to CSC for the purpose of managing the superannuation schemes and member accounts.
Personal information is provided to these service providers or to CSC directly from the superannuation member themselves, a third party associated with the member such as an adviser or family member under a power of attorney (consent is obtained from the member in these circumstances) or through an eligible employer who makes superannuation contributions on the members behalf.
CSC may also collect, hold, use and disclose information to and from a court or tribunal where required.
Type of information
The type of personal information that is collected, held, used and disclosed includes information about superannuation contributions, name and address details, date of birth, salary, employment details, beneficiary details and contact details.
Sensitive information is collected where consent has been provided and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of CSC's functions or activities. Sensitive information can also be collected where the collection of information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order. Examples of sensitive information that is collected, held used and disclosed includes health information, sexual preferences or practices and criminal records.
Information is collected via email, correspondence, telephone, or gained through the website. Sensitive information is more likely to be collected, held, used and disclosed in circumstances where an insurance or legal claim is being decided or contested, where a reconsideration of a decision is sought either internally or through the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT).
Sensitive information is primarily provided to CSC through external service providers, such as scheme administrators, insurers or by external dispute resolution bodies (such as the SCT), when dealing with claims or complaints.
Overseas recipients
CSC does not disclose personal information to overseas recipients. Where permitted by law, CSC's scheme administrators may disclose personal information for the international transfer of superannuation benefits to an approved superannuation scheme.
Inaccurate information
Where information is not provided by a superannuation member, or is inaccurate, a superannuation member may not be provided with an appropriate level of service. For example, a higher rate of taxation may be payable by the member where a Tax File Number has not been provided.
Accessing and correcting your information
Members of the superannuation schemes managed by CSC may request access to information held about them under the Privacy Act 1988 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982. Further information about FOI and CSC's Information Publication Scheme can be found here
