5. Alternatively, Users can open an Account and signup to the Services via existing third party accounts (namely, Facebook account) used by the User ( **“Facebook Connect”** ).

Nevertheless, we DO NOT keep all of this information. We only store in our databases the following: profile picture, full name and e-mail address (to the extent that your e-mail address is set as ‘public”). All other User information provided via the third party website is promptly deleted.
6. In the event that the User would like to send us Feedback regarding the Services, the User will be required to provide Come2Play with the User’s e-mail address.
