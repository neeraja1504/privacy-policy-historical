What choices do I have about Comic-Con International collecting, using, and sharing my information?
While we believe the limited disclosure of your information will result in opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your information to any third party. As noted above, Comic-Con International uses third-party venders for various administrative functions (e.g., Registration) for its events. In order for these venders to be able to provide the necessary services they need to have access to member information.
Given the concerns relating to the transfer of member information, we allow members to control the scope of transfer by providing two types of Opt-Outs for member information. The first Opt-Out allows a member to Opt-Out of having their information transferred to third-parties who are not involved in any administrative or operational aspect of an event. Selecting this Opt-Out still allows Comic-Con International to transfer the information on an as needed basis to venders who are involved in administrative or operational aspects of an event. To select this Opt-Out, login to your Member ID account, select the "Change My Preferences" option, then select the "Non-Critical Transfers" Opt- Out.
The second Opt-Out is for those members who do not want any of the information transferred to any third party. This Opt-Out If you do not want Comic-Con International to share your information with any third party, login to your Member ID account, select the "Change My Preferences" option, and select the "Cancel Member ID" Opt-Out. Please note that by selecting this "Cancel Member ID" option, your Comic-Con membership will be canceled and you will not be able to purchase badges and you will not be able to make hotel reservations through our vender. If you have already purchased a badge for Comic-Con 2012, that badge will be canceled and the purchase price will be refunded if the membership cancelation was requested before the refund deadline. Periodically our website may not allow members to enter "Cancel Member ID" requests due to system maintenance or for other reasons. If this occurs, please try again at a later date.
What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?
