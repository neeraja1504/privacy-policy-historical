Privacy Policy - costumecity.com
At Costume City, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What Information Do We Collect? How Do We Use It?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit-card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status. You may voluntarily sign up to be informed about certain offers. For this service we need only an e-mail address, which we use to send the information you requested. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address, so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
We personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web site, new Costume City services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please notify us. Make sure to notify us for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.

We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending an e-mail message to costumecity.info@gmail.com.  (If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message from each e-mail account you use.) Also, Costume City may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
