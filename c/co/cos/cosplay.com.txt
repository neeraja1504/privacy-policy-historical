Cookies
A cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for a period of time. Cosplay.com uses cookies to simplify member login and to facilitate navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Cosplay.com also uses cookies for customization of content, storing login information and statistical site-traffic analysis. Advertisers that appear on Cosplay.com may place cookies on your computer.

The Way We Use Your Information
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website, to customize the content and/or layout of our site for each individual visitor, to notify you of updates to our website, to communicate with you, and to conduct internal research on site usage and trends.
We do not share, sell or disclose your email address to third parties. You also have the option to opt-out of receiving administrative emails from our server. We retain the right to email you in any case where it is absolutely necessary. Cosplay.com aggregates anonymous information to compile demographics which may be shared with other services or companies. None of this aggregate information contains any personally identifying information.
We may share your personally identifying information if you specifically allow us to share it, such as opting in for more information on a specific product or service.
We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights, or protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users or others.
In the event Cosplay.com becomes part of another organization either through acquisition, sale of assets or merger, your user information and all personally identifying information may be transferred the successor entity, and your information would remain subject to the pre-existing privacy policy.

We strongly advise minors 13 years of age or older to ask their parents for permission before posting any information about themselves anywhere on the internet.
