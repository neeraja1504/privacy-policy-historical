Privacy Policy – Cosmetic Stuff
For each visitor to the blog, my web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name, IP address, browser type, version and e-mail address (where possible).
The information I collect is used to improve the content, to notify visitors about updates, to protect against unauthorized use, and is disclosed when required by law.
With respect to cookies, I use cookies to alert visitors to new areas that I think might be of interest to them when they return to the site and to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.
If you do not want to receive e-mail from me in the future, please let me know by sending e-mail to johnmazzara@umpire.com .
I will never share the e-mail addresses of those who access the blog with anyone without first obtaining their expressed consent, and if you supply me with your postal address online or by email, you will only receive the information for which you provided your address.
With respect to advertisements, to try and bring you offers of interest, I have relationships with companies that place ads on the blog. As a result of your visit, ad server companies may collect information about you, like your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of  Google.
From time to time, I may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy notice. If these practices change at some time in the future, I’ll update this policy, and for these new purposes will only use data collected from the time of the policy change forward.
Please check this page from time to time if you’re concerned about how your information is used. Visitors may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by e-mailing or calling me at the above address or telephone number.
Even upon request, I do not offer visitors the ability to change the information I maintain about them.
