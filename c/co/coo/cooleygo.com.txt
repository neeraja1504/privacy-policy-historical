A Note About Children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits Personal Data to Cooley and we learn that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at cooleygo@cooley.com.
A Note to Users Outside of the United States. If you are a user of the Cooley GO Site who resides in a country other than the United States, your accessing or using the Cooley GO Site in any way constitutes your agreement that (a) we may process your Personal Data for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy, and (b) your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your Personal Data, you consent to such transfer.
Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
Information You Provide to Us.
We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, mailing address, and phone number.
If you provide us feedback, post an event or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the form, in order to send you a reply.
We may also collect Personal Data at other points in the Cooley GO Site that states that Personal Data is being collected.
Information Collected via Technology.
Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Cooley GO Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“ IP “) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ ISP “), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Cooley GO Site, track users’ movements around the Cooley GO Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Cooley GO Site, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to provide information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.
Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Cooley GO Site. This type of information is collected to make the Cooley GO Site more useful to you.
Do Not Track Browser Setting. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals from web browsers.
Pixel Tags. We may use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
Collection of Data by Advertisers. We do not use third parties to serve ads on the Site or collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites.
Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Cooley GO Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Cooley GO Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Cooley GO Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Cooley GO Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Cooley GO Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Cooley GO Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Cooley GO Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

send you follow-up communications when you contact us via e-mail, submit feedback, or post an event; and
send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as updates regarding the Cooley GO Site, security, or support and maintenance advisories.
Creation of Anonymous Data. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.

Corporate Restructuring. We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.

Third Party Websites. The Cooley GO Site may contain links to third party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of your Personal Data after you click on links to such outside websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit. The links to third party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content or websites.
