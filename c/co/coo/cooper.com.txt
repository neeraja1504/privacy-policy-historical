Access your personal information
Correct your personal information
Erase your personal information
Limit processing of your personal information
Object to processing of your personal information
Obtain a portable version of your personal information
Withdraw your consent to Cooper’s use of your personal information
We will provide you with the ability to determine whether or not we process your personal information and, where we do, obtain access to the personal information, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned and the recipients of the personal information, if any. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply you a copy of your personal information. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
We will provide you with the ability to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and, where applicable, to have any incomplete personal information about you completed.
Under some circumstances we will provide you with the ability to have your personal information erased without undue delay. These circumstances include one or more of the following: your personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal information have been unlawfully processed. However, we will not erase personal information that we believe is or may be necessary for Cooper to comply with a legal obligation, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Under some circumstances we will provide you with the ability to restrict the processing of your personal information. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal information; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.  Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal information. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
We will provide you with the ability to object to our processing of your personal information on grounds relating to your particular situation.  However, we will not erase personal information that we believe is or may be necessary for Cooper to comply with a legal obligation, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
We will provide you with the ability to object to our processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal information for this purpose.
To the extent that the basis for our processing of your personal information is: (a) consent; or (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, we will provide you with the ability to receive your personal information from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
If you believe that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence or your place of work.
To the extent that the basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, we will provide you with the ability to withdraw that consent at any time.  If, for example, you request electronic communications from us, such as a newsletter, you will be able to unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included in the communication.  Withdrawal of your consent will not be applicable to Cooper’s processing of your personal information before a reasonable time for Cooper to address your withdrawal of consent.

Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
California “Do Not Track” Disclosures
Our Web server automatically recognizes and stores certain computer-readable information, such as your IP address and domain name combination. This is typically anonymous information automatically provided by your computer. We use this information to follow visitor usage patterns in order to improve user experience. If your Internet browser employs blocking or “Do Not Track” technology that limits recognition or the collection of such computer-readable information, Cooper will not alter or bypass such technology.
International transfer of Personal Information:
We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in, countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including the United States, Canada or other destinations outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the data. When we transfer your data to other countries, we will protect the data as described in this Privacy Statement and comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of data to countries outside the EEA or Switzerland.
If you are located in the EEA, we will only transfer your personal data if:
the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision; or
the recipient of the personal data is located in the US and has certified to the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework; or
we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example we have entered into EU standard contractual clauses with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding corporate rules.
