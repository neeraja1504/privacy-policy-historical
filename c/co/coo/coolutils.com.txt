Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information (typically the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request). Our sole purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use www.coolutils.com.
We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. For example, all our free online converters do not ask for your name or email or any personal info. However, we need you info to process orders and generate keys for our programs. We store personal information (names and emails) in an encrypted way on our server. We do not share your personal information with anyone except to resend the keys or inform about new upgrades. All the other personal information gathered during the purchase of CoolUtils programs is not stored on our servers as the payments are collected and processed by PayPro Global Inc.
