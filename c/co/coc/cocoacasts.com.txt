Privacy Policy
The Privacy Policy was last updated on May 25, 2018.
Cocoacasts is a product of Code Foundry BVBA. Your privacy is critically important to us. At Code Foundry BVBA, we have a few fundamental principles. (i) We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (ii) We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. (iii) We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.
Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.
Code Foundry BVBA ("Code Foundry") operates several websites and applications, including Cocoacasts. It is Code Foundry's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our products.
Website Visitors and Product Usage
Like most product businesses, Code Foundry collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Code Foundry's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Code Foundry's customers use its websites and products. From time to time, Code Foundry may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, for example, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites and products.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to cocoacasts.com choose to interact with cocoacasts.com in ways that require cocoacasts.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that cocoacasts.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Cocoacasts Plus for their name, email address, and physical address.
In each case, cocoacasts.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with cocoacasts.com. Cocoacasts.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like signing up for Cocoacasts Plus.
All of the information that is collected on cocoacasts.com will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Code Foundry discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Code Foundry's behalf or to provide Code Foundry's services or products, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Code Foundry's websites and products, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Code Foundry will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and non-personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Code Foundry discloses potentially personally-identifying and non-personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Code Foundry believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Code Foundry, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of a Code Foundry website or product and have supplied your email address, Code Foundry may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Code Foundry and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Code Foundry takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and non-personally-identifying information.
