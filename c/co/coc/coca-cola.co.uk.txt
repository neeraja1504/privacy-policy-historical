Vi.      Third-party websites
The Website is linked to third-party websites. Linked sites hosted by third parties, including sites belonging to our affiliates, are outside our control and we do not therefore assume any responsibility for the data protection practices applied by those third parties. Such links are provided purely for your convenience and do not imply that the relevant third-party site is endorsed by us. Whenever you provide payment information or other personal data through one of these third-party websites, the relevant transaction will take place on the relevant third-party website and not on ours and any personal information provided by you will be collected and checked in accordance with the relevant third party's data privacy policy. It is therefore important that you are aware of the data privacy policies and practices of those third parties.
The Website also uses software components like plug-ins from social and other networks, such as Facebook, Brightcove, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest. The plug-ins are identifiable by a logo or an additional "Like" button (Facebook). Whenever you visit websites using this type of plug-in, your browser will automatically create a direct connection to the networks' servers, sending the contents of the plug-ins to your browser and then integrating them into the Website. As a result, the information that you visited our website will be forwarded to the relevant network.
If you click the "Like" button, the information will be transferred directly to Facebook and stored there.
The data privacy policies of those networks provide further information on the purpose and scope of their collection, processing and use of data, on your rights and on settings which may help you protect your privacy.
