Cocco - Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy:
Dear Customer: Since your privacy is important to us we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
Information pertaining to the purchase of website subscriptions by credit card or bank payments is not collected by us but rather is retained only the particular processor (eg, CCBill, iBill, Verotel, etc). For their privacy policies please consult their websites; however we can provide reasonable assurance that extremely high standards of security of information are maintained by these reputable companies and that they only use your personal information for the purpose of concluding a particular transaction. We are able to access that information but do so only to assist customers with their own accounts and do not retain a record in our own databases.
Customer information pertaining to the purchase of tangible goods such as DVD disks is entered into our local database for the purpose of tracking and shipping orders. We DO NOT use or keep a record of credit card account numbers. Our database, which primarily holds names and addresses is on a password-protected computer in secure, locked facilities with authorized-personel-only access.
We do not share or sell our customer information with anyone whatsoever. We do not utilize recorded email addresses to send out unsolicited emails of any nature. We only contact customers individually should the need arise.
We may, from time to time, offer customers inclusion in an email mailing list compiled for a specific informational purpose of which the customer is informed in advance and which the customer must voluntarily sign-up for. Deletion from the list is always offered.
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at:
