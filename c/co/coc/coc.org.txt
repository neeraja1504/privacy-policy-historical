Donor  Privacy Policy
Center of Concern (Center) uses personal information that donors provide, whether for on-line or off-line donation, solely to fulfill the contractual and regulatory obligations resulting from the donation, e.g., acknowledging the donation to the donor and honoree or survivor in the case of an honorific or memorial donation; recording the donation in accounting and other internal records; and reporting the donation for tax purposes, depending on the scale and scope.
The Center does not share personal information for other reasons unless the donor gives express written permission for it to do so, and then only according to the scale and scope for such permission. The Center honors all requests from donors to remain anonymous, except for reporting obligations to tax authorities; in such cases, it makes available for public inspection a redacted version of its Internal Revenue Service Form 990 that omits this personal information.
The Center does not sell or share donor lists. The Center periodically may contact donors who supply it with their postal address and/or e-mail address for solicitation purposes and/or to share information regarding resources, program performance, and upcoming events. The Center makes available to all donors an option to receive a single contact annually. The Center honors all requests for removal from mailing lists, regardless of the means for the request, including e-mail, postal mail, telephone, or in-person communication.
The Center does not participate in telephone fundraising activities, directly or through third parties. When the Center contacts donors via telephone, it does so solely regarding previous donations.
To contact the Center regarding its policies and procedures for protecting personal information, or to give instructions regarding the Center’s use of your personal information, please use one of the following means:

This aggregate information is used solely in the pursuit of helping us improve our web site.
Does the Center of Concern use cookies?
Yes, while we use cookies for a variety of purposes, we do not use cookies to collect personal information about site visitors. The site does use cookies in our online store as well as in the Education for Justice area of the site. Please see the specific policies for that service below.
A "cookie" is a tiny element of data that our site can send to your browser which may then be stored on your hard drive. Cookies that are sent to your browser by our site are only readable by the Center of Concern and are never shared with any other site. If you are concerned about your privacy and the use of cookie technology on the Center of Concern you may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

We will always explain the extent of its use at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt out." Under certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, such as the participation in online actions or subscription to the Center of Concern newsletter.
Does the Center of Concern rent, sell or trade my information?

How do I know my credit card information is secure?
The Center of Concern uses secure server software (SSL) that is the industry standard and is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. In the event of an unauthorized charge to your credit card you must 1) write to the creditor at the address given for "billing inquiries," not the address for sending your payments, and include your name, address, account number and a description of the billing error, 2) send your letter so that it reaches the creditor within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you.
What do I do if I have questions that aren't answered here?
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or your dealings with this website, please contact us.
Changes to our Policy
The Center of Concern reserves the right to change these policies at its sole discretion without any obligation, to modify or correct errors and omissions within the web site. Changes to this policy will always be posted and public. If any changes are made to the type of information we collect or to the ways in which we use that information, clear, specific instructions will be provided on how you may opt out of new practices.
