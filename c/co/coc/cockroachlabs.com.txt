Privacy
Privacy Policy
Last Revised: February 6, 2019
Cockroach Labs, Inc. (“ CRL ,” “ we ,” or “ us ”) provides this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information (“ Personal Information ”) about you when you visit or use any of the websites owned or operated by CRL (collectively, the “ Sites ”), any of our products or services that you can access, download, or use via the Sites (collectively, the “ Services ”), or when you otherwise interact with us. By visiting or using the Sites or any of our Services, you consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, products, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Sites or the Services.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy, adding a statement to our homepage, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to use the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at info@cockroachlabs.com.
Information We Collect
Information You Provide to Us
We collect any Personal Information that you give us. For example, we collect Personal Information about you when you sign up for one of our Services, create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Sites or the Services, fill out a form, give us feedback, ideas or submissions about any of the Services, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, register for white papers, web seminars, and other events hosted by us, or otherwise communicate with us via the Sites, the Services, or any other means.
The types of Personal Information we may collect include your name, email address, credit/debit card information, as well as any other Personal Information you choose to provide to us. For information about ways to limit our collection of your Personal Information, please see the “ Account Information ” section below. If you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, you understand that we may not be able to provide certain of our Services to you, and that certain features of our Sites or Services may be unavailable or work differently.
Personal Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Sites or the Services
When you access or use the Sites or use the Services (or certain portions of the Sites or Services), we automatically collect certain Personal Information about you. This information includes:
Log Information : We log Personal Information from your use of the Sites and the Services, including the type of device you use, access times, IP address, pages viewed, and the page you visited before navigating to one of our Sites and/or using the Services. We use this information for analytics and product improvement purposes.
Device Information : We collect Personal Information about the computer or device you use to access the Sites and the Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version and unique device identifiers. We use this information for analytics and product improvement purposes.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies : We use various technologies to collect Personal Information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory, while web beacons (also known as “ tracking pixels ”) are non-visible electronic images. These technologies are used for analytics and product improvement purposes, such as seeing which areas and features of our Sites and Services are popular, or determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see the “ Cookies ” section below.
Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy : Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
Personal Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may obtain Personal Information about you from other sources, and combine that with information we collect through your access and use of our Sites and the Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a site like Google.com or GitHub.com, we may have access to certain information about you from those sites, such as your name, log-in credentials, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by those sites. We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from companies that provide our products and services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our website (“ Third Party Companies ”). Our Third Party Companies may supply us with Personal Information, such as your calendars and address book information, in order to help us establish the account. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our website in order to improve the products and services we provide.
Personal Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Sites or the Services:
Provide, deliver, maintain, test and improve our Sites and Services;
Send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and to provide customer service;
Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events offered by CRL and others, and to provide news and information that we think may be of interest to you;

Detect, investigate and prevent suspected breaches of the terms applicable to your use of our Sites and Services; and
Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs, and to provide you with better service.
CRL does not use your Personal Information for purposes that are materially different from the purposes described above, unless you otherwise authorize us to do so.
Additionally, we collect and use de-identified information about your usage of the Services through diagnostic reports in order to help us understand and improve the Services. For more information about diagnostics reporting (including how to opt-out), please visit https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/diagnostics-reporting.html.
