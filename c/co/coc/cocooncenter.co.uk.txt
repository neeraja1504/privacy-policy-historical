"Plug-ins" and social modules
Our site uses "plug-ins" or social modules. These include little buttons such as "like", "share" by third-party social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. which you will find on our websites. They allow you to like and share information from our websites and apps with your friends on social networks. When you consult a page of our COCOONCENTER sites (web or mobile) containing plug-ins or social modules, a connection is established with the servers of the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) which are then informed that you have accessed the corresponding page of the COCOONCENTER site, even if you do not have a Facebook or Twitter user account, and even if you are not connected to your Facebook or Twitter account.

If you use the plug-ins (e.g. like), your actions can be recorded and published on your accounts in the social networks according to the setting of your social network account. If you do not want social networks to post your actions from plug-ins to your social network accounts, you must sign out of your social networks before visiting our site.
