The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at Car Buyers Guide. We use the information to deliver services and products, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as my basket and customer reviews and recommend vehicles and services that might be of interest to you.

Here are the types of information we gather.

Automatic information: we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Car Buyers Guide. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Car Buyers Guide if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

Does Car Buyers Guide Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below:
Agents: we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering magazine packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the Data Protection Act.
Promotional offers: sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Car Buyers Guide customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give them your name or address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please send a blank email to remove@cbg.ie
