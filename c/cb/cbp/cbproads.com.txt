When you engage in activities on our website or within our services, like registering, using trial versions of services, requesting technical support, or subscribing to newsletters and e-mail publications, CBproADS may ask you to provide us with information.
By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to CBproADS' collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes of providing the services to you as outlined herein.
Any information you post to our live customer support chat window is available to all staffs of the site.
Any information collected will be used only by CBproADS to improve our services and website, or to communicate with you in the form of newsletters and notices if you give us permission to do so. CBproADS uses information and/or e-mail addresses for internal purposes only and does not sell, lease or rent information to third parties.
This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.
In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
