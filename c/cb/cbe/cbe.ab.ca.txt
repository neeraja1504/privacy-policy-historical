Privacy Statement - Privacy Statement - CBE
The CBE is subject to the Alberta Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act, and is committed to providing a website that respects your privacy while you visit us online. This privacy statement summarizes the privacy practices of the CBE with respect to our web site.
We do not automatically gather any personal information from you, such as your name, phone number, or email address. This information is obtained only if you supply it voluntarily, usually through contacting us via email or by providing it on an online form. You should review the privacy statement each time you submit personal information on the website.
Any personal information you do provide is managed according to the FOIP Act. This means that at the point of collection, you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected, the legal authority for collection and the person who can answer your questions about the collection. The CBE does not sell or otherwise distribute any information collected to third parties.
Information Collected in Emails and Online Forms
We treat emails with the same respect we treat letters sent to the CBE. We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you. The only personal information collected that is used to identify you is information you give voluntarily. When you submit a question or comment, you may be asked for your name, email address, or other information. This personal information is used to process and respond to your question or comment and is only disclosed to those who need it to answer your question, to the person that your inquiry relates to or to parties legislatively authorized to receive the information.
If you complete an online form and submit it to us through our website, we use that information for the purposes described on the form. Personal information collected from an online form will be treated in accordance with the privacy protection provisions of the FOIP Act.
