Data Collection and Dissemination
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Notice and Policy, the following discloses our data gathering and dissemination practices.
Cboe values your privacy and processes your personal data, as a data controller, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  Processing means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.
Cboe processes your personal data for certain legitimate business purposes/interests which may include some or all of the following:
To administer and manage our relationship with you
To evaluate, review, approve, or enter into potential contractual arrangements
To enable us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services/ communications for the benefit of users

Use of a Cboe Website may involve the collection of personal data by Cboe. There are also cases where users may be asked for personal data on a Cboe Website. For example, online surveys are occasionally conducted to better understand the needs and profiles of Cboe Website users. Our online surveys typically ask users for demographic and profile data such as zip code, age, and income level. In addition, personal data is requested if you voluntarily register to receive additional information about Cboe, sign up for Cboe products and services, or if you want to purchase a product directly from a Cboe Website. Voluntary Cboe Website registration forms may request user personal data such as name, mailing address and/or e-mail address. Registered users of Cboe Websites may have certain "opt-out" choices which are described in the choice/opt-out section below.
What Data We Share
Cboe will only grant access to personal data on a need-to-know basis, and such access will be limited to the personal data that is necessary to perform the business function for which such access is granted.  No authorization will be extended to access personal data on a personal basis.
From time to time, your personal data may be processed on our behalf by, or shared with, Cboe affiliates and other unaffiliated parties. (collectively “third parties”). Third parties who process your data may include agents, suppliers, vendors, business partners, and regulatory agencies that are located in the United States and in other countries inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) for the purposes outlined above.  For data transfers outside the EEA to third parties, Cboe relies on appropriate safeguards, as defined in GDPR and as approved by the European Commission, to provide an adequate level of protection.
Select third party providers which may process your personal data may be found in the “Service Providers” section below.
Security
Cboe shall exercise reasonable precautions to safeguard and secure personal data. Cboe has security protections in place that help to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control. Security protections use technology consistent with current industry standards. Cboe periodically tests the security protections of its information systems and monitors the effectiveness of its information security controls, systems and procedures. Although we take proper measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of data, no assurances can be provided that personal data that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice and Policy.
Data Retention
Cboe will retain your personal data for as long as your account, membership, customer relationship or any other business relationship with Cboe, as applicable, is active and as needed to provide you with products or services. In addition, personal data may be retained for such additional time as may be required under applicable law.
