Data collection & your privacy
Hypenica respects your privacy and seeks to protect your personal data. It is the aim of Hypenica to ensure that the processing of personal data by or on behalf of Hypenica is fair and reasonable and that your personal data is secure, accurate and up to date. Each time we want to collect personal data, we will tell you the purposes for which we use the data and then ask for your consent to that usage. We only use your data for the purposes for which you consent. Because Hypenica is an international organization, personal data may be made available internationally, including countries which have varying data protection laws – however we require those to whom we transfer your data to protect it and your privacy in line with the existing Hypenica privacy policy.
Hypenica collects personal information from you through the use of enquiry and registration forms and every time you e-mail us your details. This information includes contact, registration and payment details, as well as details of individuals’ interests. It is used for administration and to support, improve and obtain feedback on Hypenica products and services and to prevent and detect breaches of network security, the law or our contract terms. We also collect information automatically about your visit to our site. The information obtained in this way, which includes demographic data and browsing patterns, is only used in aggregate form.
Hypenica may use this information to assess what products and services may be of interest to individuals and to personalize the service we provide.
If you agree, Hypenica may, from time to time contact you about its services which may interest you and in some circumstances invite you to conferences and similar events, or offer you subscription or marketing opportunities by mail, fax, e-mail and by telephone. You have a right to ask us at any time not to contact you by way of direct marketing.
Except where the law permits or unless you agree, Hypenica does not sell or rent your personal data to others outside of Hypenica. In some instances, we may pass relevant information to third parties involved with Hypenica, such as administration companies acting as sub-contractors to Hypenica ( e.g. companies that process credit card payments, handle conference registration etc) or if the data is required to be disclosed by law on to a regulator.
If you have any questions about Hypenica’s privacy/data protection policy, please contact Errol Bryce on errol.bryce@hypenica.com
