How does the CMMI Institute use Internet Based Advertising?
We may – or may have third parties, on our behalf - display to a visitor interest-based advertising and other custom content regarding our capabilities, products or services that may be of interest to visitors. This advertising may be served to a visitor on our Platform, or in our emails or on third-party sites or may be placed on other websites. It may be based on assumed interests attributed to a specific visitor, based on the use of our Platform by that visitor, or use information gathered about that visitor over time across multiple sites. They may be based on other interactions you have with us or our Platform. They may be based on other activities and behaviors that you demonstrate online.
The information collected about a user’s use of our Platform, or across the Internet, the products in which the user appears to be interested, etc., may be used to build an assumed profile of a particular person. To do so, our service provider may place or recognize a unique cookie on the user’s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags. If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID or Advertising ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you.
How to Opt-out of Interest Based Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving interest based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear any opt-out cookie.
Each visitor may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered to them on other websites by visiting the following websites, please visit http://www.aboutads.info or http://www.networkadvertising.org.
Mobile device visitors may also download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out from interested based advertising served in mobile apps.
The features above will allow a visitor to opt out of many –but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.
Do Not Track
Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Consequently, due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.
Links to Third-Party Sites or Applications
The Platform may allow you to directly access applications or services operated by third parties. These links are provided for your convenience only and should be used at your discretion. These links do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of the content, policies or practices of such third-parties’ applications.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. We are not responsible for any information these third-parties’ services may obtain or how they may use it. You should review their privacy notices to understand how they may use your information.
