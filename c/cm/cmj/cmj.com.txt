Children’s Online Privacy Protection
The safety of children is important to us. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age without prior parental consent and notification, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information. In the absence of prior parental consent,
information received online will only be used to respond directly to the child’s request and will not be used for any other purpose. In an effort to insure parental consent, we require that all CMJ Rewards
Program participants seeking to exchange ‘Points’ for Rewards items have a valid credit card tied to a verifiable physical address.
Further, if a minor seeks to redeem ‘Points’ for a Reward item, we will notify the minor’s parents by email, telephone or letter in order to confirm the existence of parental consent.
Please keep in mind that whenever someone voluntarily discloses personal information online, that information may be collected and used by others. If you post personal information online that is
accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from outside parties. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account information and passwords. We urge you to be
cautious and responsible whenever online.
We may, from time to time, amend this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion. By continuing to visit and participate on the Sites, following such change, you will be deemed to have agreed to such change(s). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or any subsequent changes, amendments or revisions to the Privacy Policy, you must cease using the Sites.
