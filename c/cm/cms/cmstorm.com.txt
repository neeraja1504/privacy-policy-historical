Cooler Master: Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 30, 2018
1. What’s in this policy?
This policy tells you:
What information we might collect about you
How we might use that information
When we might use your details to contact you
What information of yours we might share with others
Your choices about the personal information you give us
2. What does this policy cover?
This policy covers the services that are offered by the Cooler Master Technology Inc.
And sometimes it covers services offered by parts of our organization that operate as separate companies.
What’s not covered in this policy?
Our services sometimes link to services run by other companies, like embedded online videos such as Youtube or analytics platforms such as Google Analytics. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours.
We sometimes offer Cooler Master branded services to other companies, like Cooler Master YouTube page, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Instagram. Make sure to check their privacy policy so you know how they will use your information.
3. How do you protect my personal information?
We're strongly committed to keeping your information safe. And to do this we design our services with your safety in mind. We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.
At the same time, no service can be completely secure - if you have any concerns that your CM Fanzone account, CM Store accounts, or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please get in touch straight away.
Where we store your information
Some companies that provide service to us run their services from different regions. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the EEA.
What types of personal information does Cooler Master collect about me?
We'll give details about why we need your personal information and how we'll use it before you begin, unless it's obvious.
a. Information that you give us
We might ask for your name and contact details, your date of birth or locations, depending on what you’re doing. For example: If you apply for an online RMA service, we might ask you about your contact information.
b. Device information
Devices are lots of things like:
Your computer
Your mobile
Your tablet
We automatically collect some technical information from these devices and web browsers even when you’re not signed in to a Cooler Master (CM Fanzone) account. This might include:
IP (internet protocol) address
c. Information on your activities outside of Cooler Master when you talk about us
Like if you’ve mentioned us in a Facebook post, we’ll collect your Facebook handle.
What if I have a CM Fanzone account?
When you register for a CM Fanzone account, or update your details or settings we ask for some personal information, like your email address and age.
We also collect information about how you use our services, like the articles you read.
What if I have a CM Store account?
When you register for a CM Store account, we’ll also collect specific information needed to deliver your order, and process your payment securely.
4. How long will the Cooler Master keep my personal information?
When you give us any personal information we'll let you know how long we'll hold it for. And always stick to these principles:
We only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a valid reason to keep it
For our FanZone and CM Store accounts, we will keep data which allows you to have continued use of your account services until you request to close or delete your account.
We design our services so that we don't hold your information any longer than we have to
5. How can Cooler Master use my personal information?
We have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like when you subscribe to an email.

A few things on our websites wouldn't work without some cookies. Tech people call these "strictly necessary cookies". They're always on when you visit us.

Bear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These "third-party cookies" might track how you use different websites, including ours.

Some are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so they're there when you come back.
d. How do I control my cookies and tracking?
You are always able to delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser.
Stopping all cookies might mean you can't access some Cooler Master services, or that some of them might not work properly for you.
