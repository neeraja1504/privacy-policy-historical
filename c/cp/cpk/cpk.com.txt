California Pizza Kitchen - Privacy Policy
a. Personally Identifiable Information.
In general, you can visit CPK.com or download the App without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, our Sites offer certain features or services, including but not limited to CPK Rewards Program enrollment, online food ordering, fundraising inquiries, gift card purchases, and online job applications (collectively, “Services”) that require you to share certain information that personally identifies you with us or our third party service providers ("Providers"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personally Identifiable Information," or "PII" means your name (last name combined with first name or first initial), your CPK account log-in information, your email address, your phone number, and your physical address. Some Services require you to disclose certain types of PII while making the disclosure of some types of information optional. You may also be asked to generate a username and password for future access to an account related to your use of Services. If you order food on our Sites, you will be redirected to the site of our ordering Provider, Mobo Systems, Inc., dba Olo ("Olo") and, if you choose to pay via Olo, you will be asked for information related to that transaction, including your credit card number, its expiration date and security code, and your zip code ("Credit Card Information"). If you wish to use the pay by mobile function in one of our restaurants, you will be asked to add your Credit Card Information to your account profile in the App. For your security, we do not keep or store your Credit Card Information after your purchase transaction is completed unless you elect to create an account containing your Credit Card Information. If you place a food order for delivery, we may use your PII and/or location information, described in paragraph 2.b. below, or provide your PII and/or location information to one of our delivery Providers to complete the delivery order.
b. Social Networking Information
We may provide the opportunity for you to post information about yourself and/or your experiences with us through various social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Plus, and Pinterest), including for purposes of entering any contest or sweepstakes. Remember that any information you post will become publicly available, so please use discretion. We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalize your experience on the Site. This information may include PII, such as your username or ID and email address, as well as interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Sites or of social media. We may use your PII to locate you via social media for marketing purposes.
c. Contact information for email newsletters, emails and/or mobile offers
From time to time, we send newsletters, emails, push notifications, and/or other communications to share information or special offers about the Sites, the Services, contests and sweepstakes, special events, or our restaurants. If you have registered with any of our Sites, you are likely to receive such communications. If you provide us with your mobile number and elect to do so, you may receive text notifications as well. Remember, if you elect to receive texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on inbound and outbound text messages. Please check with your wireless carrier for details.
You may opt out of receiving promotional email communications from us by modifying your email preferences in your account profile or by following the instructions or links contained in the communications when we send them to you. You may opt out of receiving text messages by following the instructions in the text message. You may opt out of receiving push notifications on your mobile device by adjusting your notifications settings. Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, you may still receive transactional communications from us, including emails about your account or your purchases.
d. Entry information for Contests or Sweepstakes
From time to time, we may operate contests, sweepstakes or other promotions through our Site, our social media outlets, or in our restaurants, which may require registration on a Site or in our CPK Rewards Program in order to enter. The PII that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, your first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age, and email address. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists.
Winners of contests, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will often be required to provide additional PII in order to authenticate themselves and collect a prize. Entry into a contest or sweepstakes or acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site or our promotional materials, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your PII may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation, or other promotional purposes.
If the privacy statement varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion, or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature’s terms of use. We urge you to review the official rules and privacy statement (if different) of the particular contest/sweepstakes before participating. In the event that the Official Rules of a contest/sweepstakes conflict with or provide us with broader disclosure rights than set forth in this Privacy Statement, the Official Rules will govern the PII disclosed in connection with that contest or sweepstakes.
e. Information collected for Surveys or Voting
From time-to-time, we may request PII from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and will not request your PII. However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide what information to provide.
