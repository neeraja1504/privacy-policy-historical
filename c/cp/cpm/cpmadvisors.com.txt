Privacy Policy
The following describes the overall company practices of BN, Inc. including all subsidiaries, affiliates and network (referred to as “BN”, “Brand Networks”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our web sites (including but not limited to bn.co) and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it and how it is used.
What Information Is Collected?
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE CONSUMER DATA
Brand Networks may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a BN Web site or the Web site of one of BN’s business customers, including advertisers and Web publishers (collectively “Business Customers”). This anonymous data includes information such as a web visitor’s IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels.
These cookie-based technologies allow us and our advertisers to better target advertising to user interests, and provide other benefits for example, to limit any person seeing a given advertisement too many times. If you want to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising that uses anonymous browser cookies, please click here.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE CONSUMER DATA (PII)
To date, on our wholly owned properties we do not ask for personally identifiable information other than outlined below for business purposes. At some of BN’s partner properties, people may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data. BN is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.
OTHER INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED
At some BN properties, including this one, BN collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with BN (“business information”). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of BN’s web advertising network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information and sending payments. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.
How Is Such Information Used?
BN will use your non-personal information in order to better target advertisements and offers across the BN network, to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumer preferences with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners for similar use. If a consumer elects to provide BN with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to better serve consumers with offers that may be of interest to them. For example, you may register for a newsletter and provide us with your email, If a consumer elects to provide us with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the service in question. We collect PII from customers who are individuals or companies that wish to enter into business relationships with BN, including websites and online marketers. This customer information is used only for purposes of administering these relationships, including maintaining account information, managing payments and communicating with the client. BN may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BN; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of BN; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BN, its websites or the public; 4) To provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer.
SECURITY
BN uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to BN and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, BN makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
