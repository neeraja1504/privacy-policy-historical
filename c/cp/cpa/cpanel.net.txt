What Information We Gather and Track
We request personal information when you place an order, request a service, answer a survey, correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our Web site.
For example:
1. If you submit an order on-line with us, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction - such as your name, address, and credit card number.
2. If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction - such as your name, email address, and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.
How We Use the Information We Gather and Track
We use personally identifiable information in the following ways:
1. To provide you with information about security alerts, product discounts, informative mailings, and policy changes;
2. To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you;
3. To provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you and to improve your experience on our Web site;

5. To allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select;
6. To help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you.
With Whom We May Share Your Information
cPanel takes personal privacy seriously. While we may need to share your information with third parties, cPanel will share your information only with parties that require such information. An example of this is that we must share your credit card information with our credit card processor so you can place orders on our site.
Information posted in public profiles (forums, manage2) is not considered private and is therefore not protected under this privacy policy.

These measures include technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction. Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.
