CNAS Privacy Policy | Center for a New American Security
The Center for a New American Security values our visitors' private information and understands the need for security and trust surrounding such information.
The following policy outlines the ways in which we collect, store and use personally identifiable information in providing our products and services. Except for very limited exceptions further described in the remainder of this Privacy Policy, we do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties.
**Information Collection & Use **
For each visitor to our Website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address (where possible). We collect only the domain name, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Website, and is only disclosed when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website.
Event Registration
In order to attend a CNAS event, you may need to first complete an online registration form or send us your contact details. We may use this information to contact you about the event for which you have registered, or a similar future event which we determine may be of interest to you.
If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.
Email a Friend/Forward to a Colleague
If you use referral services to tell a friend/colleague about our site or electronic newsletters, we will send your friend/colleague a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the location you have specified. CNAS does not retain this information in our database.
E-Mail Communications from CNAS

If you wish to subscribe to our event announcements or receive other materials, we will use your e-mail address to send the requested materials. We always provide a way to unsubscribe or opt out. Please see the “Manage Your Preferences” or “Opt-out” at the bottom of the email you receive to be removed from our mailing list.
