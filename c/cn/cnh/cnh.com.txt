Effective Date:  January 01, 2002 (Updated 2012)
PURPOSE
CNH is committed to providing privacy protection of employee data that is maintained by the company.  CNH complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  CNH has certified with the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CNH’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.  Compliance with the safe harbor framework demonstrates the adequate privacy protection required by the European Commission's Directive.
SCOPE
This policy applies to CNH Global N.V., and its subsidiaries.
INTRODUCTION
CNH maintains a global Human Resources Management System (HRMS) to manage and administer the Company's human resources data storage.  The database for the HRMS is located at the Company's data center in Italy, which is maintained by a subsidiary or  an affiliate of the Company.  The system provides a benefit to the company and employees and is used to support payroll, benefits, and bonuses, improve training programs, plan career development, monitor workplace health and safety, and supports the company goal of being the "best place to work."
POLICY
Notice:   Employees are asked to provide personal data at hiring, and throughout their employment, for the purpose of compensation including fringe benefits and other tasks related to the operation of the company.  Employees may request to review their personal information maintained in the HRMS by contacting the Human Resource Representative for their location.  Employees should direct any inquiries or complaints, regarding personal data, to their local HR Representative.
Choice:   There are situations when personal data are transmitted to third parties to provide compensation, fringe benefits, or to satisfy home country government reporting requirements.  Prior written consent of employees will not be requested for this employment-related data.  CNH will not provide personal data to any other third party without the prior written consent of the employee.
**Onward Transfer:  ** If personal data is transferred to third parties acting as an agent for the company, such third party will be required to either subscribe to the safe harbor principles or enter into a written agreement with CNH requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles.
Security:   Access to the HRMS is controlled by a log-on sequence and requires all users to identify themselves and provide a password before access is granted.  Users are limited to data required to perform their job function.  Security features of the HRMS software and developed processes are used to protect personal information form loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Data Integrity and Access:   Employee data maintained by the company will be used for the sole purpose of supporting company operations and providing employee benefits.  Company HR and Payroll processes include tasks and procedures to keep personal data accurate, complete, and current.  Employees have the option to review personal data by contacting their local HR representative.  As part of the review process, employees can correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate.
Enforcement:   Annual review of this policy and principles will take place as part of the certification process with the U.S. Department of Commerce.  CNH will include internal compliance reviews as part of the company internal audit process.  Employees should forward any complaints or disputes regarding personal data protection to their local HR Representatives.  Complaints or disputes that cannot be remedied by the local HR Representative should be forwarded to the Office of Corporate Secretary located at:
Attn:  Office of Corporate Secretary
6900 Veterans Blvd.
Burr Ridge, IL   60527-7111
CNH agrees to cooperate with (local country) data protection authorities to resolve disputes with employees that cannot be remedied directly with the employee.
The Company has the authority to change or terminate this policy in whole or in part.  Similarly, the Company retains its sole and absolute discretionary authority to resolve all questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application of this policy.  This authority includes construing the terms of this policy, including any disputed or doubtful terms.  The Company's determination will be conclusive and binding on all persons.
