Echo Nest music identification
This feature has been removed from current versions of CDBurnerXP.
For music identification (if you use the feature), CDBurnerXP generates a fingerprint of the song you identify (basically a “compressed” version of the music that only is a few KB in size) and submits it to EchoNest servers. No further data that identifies yourself or your file is submitted.

Installer / OpenCandy
OpenCandy has been replaced by installCore in current versions of CDBurnerXP and is no longer active in older installers.
Installer / installCore
The default installer (setup packages without installCore are also available) makes use of the installCore advertisement platform. When installing CDBurnerXP, you are asked to review and accept the installCore Installation Guidelines.
This installer uses installCore to recommend other software you may find valuable during the installation of this software. installCore collects NON-personally identifiable information about this installation and the recommendation process.
