Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we've developed this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used within our sites and services.

When Personal Information Is Collected and How CDI College Uses Your Personal Information
CDI College collects personal information to make our site(s) and service(s) more relevant and rewarding for you to use.
For each visitor to our Web pages, our Web server automatically recognizes your domain, service provider, operating system, and internet browser. Our Web server additionally records usage of pages by our visitors. We use this information, in aggregate, for our research reports and performance surveys. We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.
Some of CDI Collegeâ€™s pages request you to provide personally identifiable information in order to participate in the activities and offerings within. We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to our services, to fulfill a request by you, or to contact you about your account with us. Most of our communications provide an "opt-out" feature.
We may also use your information to update internal systems. This allows for seamless delivery of services and resources to you across CDI College.
The CDI College website(s) and service(s) may contain email services, bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal Web pages, calendars, photo displays and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with others (collectively, "Communication Services"). The information we collect in connection with these Communication Services is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these Communication Services. Within many of these Communication Services, CDI College provides you multiple privacy options that allow you to restrict the use and viewability of your information to others.
