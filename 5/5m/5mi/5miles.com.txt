What does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information, including Personal Information (defined below) that we gather when you access or use any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and also applies to your use of our website(s), products, services and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”), but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this information for you to interact with our Services, internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties as described below.
Will 5miles ever change this Privacy Policy?
We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, and we may also change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well.  We may alert you to changes by placing a notice on the website at https://www.5miles.com/, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

If you are not an adult, you are not authorized to download the application, register, and create an account with us.  All minors require permission from their respective legal representative in order to use the Services.  5miles does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us.

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at support@5milesapp.com.
What Information Does 5miles Collect?
The information we collect is used to improve the content and user experience of our Services. The type of information we may collect from you includes both personally identifiable information, which is information such as your first and last name, email address, phone number, home address and third-party account credentials (e.g., your Facebook login credentials, Google login credentials) (“Personal Information”), your location (which can be real-time), and demographic information such as information regarding your gender, nationality and occupation (“Demographic Information”).

Non-personal information is, generally, information that does not identify you and it includes such things as the type of mobile device used to access the application, device ID, browser type and version, date and time of a user’s visit, and language preference. Non-personal information that we collect automatically is discussed below.
In the interest of safety, we also collect information that could potentially identify a user, such as a user’s IP address when the user logs into the Services.
How Does 5miles Collect My Information?
Information You Provide :
5miles collects information that you provide directly to us.  For instance, during the registration process (or when you update your account) you provide us with Personal Information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, and possibly your Facebook (or other social media platform) credentials and your Google credentials.
Additionally, there may be instances where you find it necessary to communicate directly with us or where you have provided us with the means to communicate with you. For example, if you have given us your email address, we may send promotional email offers to you, notify you of any changes to the Terms or Services, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive data when you open an email from us or use our Services, including your contacts information. This data helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services. You are, however, free to opt out of receiving email communications from us by navigating to the settings page within the Services. Please note, however, that you may be unable to opt out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Services, such as an order confirmation or service notifications.
Information Collected Automatically :
Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, browser and/or device type, and the page or feature you requested.  This method of information collection is discussed in more detail below:
Cookies : Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to improve your overall 5miles user experience. For instance, cookies allow us to preserve our users’ preferences and record session information, such as what pages a user visits or items the user looks at, recognize the user’s browser or device type, and determine which pages and/or features are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
Through cookies we place on your mobile device or browser, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and to customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option which allows  you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Currently our Services do not monitor, support or take any action with respect to “Do Not Track” requests, signals or mechanisms, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
Location : The 5miles marketplace is geared specifically toward facilitating transactions between sellers and interested buyers who are within proximity to those sellers. For example, we use your location info to determine that you are in San Francisco so that we can prioritize and deliver listings from San Francisco or places nearby to you. As such, the collection of users’ location information is absolutely essential to providing you with the best and most useful marketplace experience we can.
When you access our Service through a mobile device or application, we and a third party partner may receive or collect and store the advertising identification number associated with your device and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (such as latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. You may enable or disable the collection of this data at any time using the settings on your mobile device by: (a) deleting the app or adjusting the in-app settings of the app if the app makes that option available; or (b) deleting or resetting the applicable mobile advertiser ID by limiting ad tracking on your device. You may also use the Digital Advertising Alliances “AppChoices” application (available at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) to opt out of participating third party advertising networks who target advertising to your mobile device based on your mobile advertising identifier.
Device Information : When you access the 5miles Services via your mobile device or computer, we collect and may share data we collect about you including unique identification numbers associated with mobile devices or through its API (including, for example, a Unique ID for Advertisers ("IDFA"), Unique ID for Vendors ("IDFV"), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, battery life, and, depending on the user’s mobile device settings, the geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of the mobile device (“User Data”) with our third party partners, that enables us to provide you with information, advertisements, or offers specific to your location and interests.
Information from Third Parties :
You may have the option of registering a 5miles account and logging into or otherwise linking to that account using a third-party account such as Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application. If you choose to provide or log into your account using your credentials for a third-party platform we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, contacts or friend’s lists, account information, public profile, and email address. Consequently, if you provide your third-party account credentials, you acknowledge that the above-identified information, as well as other information for that account (collectively, “Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your 5miles account if you authorize such transmissions. You further acknowledge that Third Party Account Information transmitted to us is governed by this Privacy Policy. Please note that certain information may be required to register a 5miles account or to take advantage of some of our features.  Also, 5miles may, from time to time, combine information from other sources with information we collect through 5miles Services in order to enhance our ability to serve you, prevent fraudulent transactions, tailor our content to you, offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for any other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Is My Personal Information Secure?
Protecting your privacy is important to us, which is why 5miles endeavors to protect the security of your privacy and information using commercially reasonable security measures. Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Therefore, 5miles cannot guarantee that your information will never be hacked or that your information is free from unauthorized access, data loss, or other breaches. In other words, your use of the 5miles application or website is at your own risk. 5miles encourages you to exercise caution when using the 5miles Services by keeping your password safe and not sharing it with other individuals.
By accepting this Privacy Policy and the corresponding Terms and continuing to use the Services, you acknowledge that 5miles is not responsible for your own disclosure of your information to third parties through our Services (e.g., sending your contact information to another user through the Services). Further, you acknowledge that you, and you alone, are responsible for the content of your profile and the accuracy thereof.
