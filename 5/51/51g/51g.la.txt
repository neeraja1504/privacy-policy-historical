Collection and Use of User Details
When you register at www.la, we may collect personal details about you. Personal information such as your name, address, email address and job title is collected via www.la's registration forms.

Cookies
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during a www.la visit. This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site. It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them). This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit. We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop www.la in the light of our analysis of people's usage. We also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content.
You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again.
Unlike many sites, you will be able to use www.la even if you set your browser not to accept any cookies. However, certain features and content may not be available to you and you will have to log in every time you visit.
