PRIVACY POLICY
50 Cubes Inc. is committed to maximizing your experience on our website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in the 50 Cubes website ( www.50cubes.com ) and enhance your experience. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online at our website or in any of our games, including Mall World , Fashion Designer , Fashion Tale and Shop Spot.

(1) What types of information does 50 Cubes collect and how will it be used?
50 Cubes only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send spam or sell email addresses. So that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that you register for a personal account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration, we collect identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and demographic information such as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, usage of the 50 Cubes website, favorite games). Our website contains links through which an online user can email us. We collect personal information contained in the email for the purpose of responding to a user's questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on our website job openings at 50 Cubes and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant's qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy policy.
No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.
From time to time we may offer marketing or promotional programs in which eligible and selected users may receive an award, compensation or other benefit based on participation. The conditions of any such program are stated in our Terms of Use Agreement accessible on this screen.

(4) Does 50 Cubes use cookies or other means to collect information?
You will know when personally identifiable information is collected because you will be asked to fill out a form. However, we may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our website, your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.) We do not use IP addresses or cookies to collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, or to link this information to personally identifiable information already collected about you. This information may be used to make our website more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect our service, website or users to the website.
(5) With whom does 50 Cubes share my personally identifiable information?
From time to time, we may employ and share your personal information with vendors who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of our website (e.g., technical support and network delivery).

It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your personal information to any company not directly related to 50 Cubes as a provider or customer. 50 Cubes reserves the right to share your personally identifiable information with our parent or affiliated companies.
