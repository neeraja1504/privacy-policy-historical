INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY GATHERED WHEN YOU VISIT A SITE
Our web servers automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our Sites. These “access logs” allow us to enhance the Sites for all visitors. The access logs do not record a visitor’s name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information: the date of the visit; the time and length of the visit; the path taken through the Sites; the browser being used; a list of files downloaded or viewed; the amount of time spent listening to audio files; the Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), as may be assigned by your Internet Service Provider, of the machine accessing our Sites; and any errors encountered.
We use this information to aid the technical administration of the Sites and to better understand how the Sites are functioning for users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data either through registration or a purchase via the Sites. This information may also be used in aggregate form.
We may track your visit to sections of our Sites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, “cookies” or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information.

You may opt out of Google Remarketing Ads on Google’s website.
