List of Features and Review of WannaMeet App
There's no doubt that the evolution of communication technology, embodied primarily by smartphones has changed the way we communicate, and even how we establish relationships. In the old days, if you wanted to meet someone to see if there was a spark, you'd have to set up a first-date, find out about the other person and sometimes endure an evening of dead space between the useless banter. But no longer.
Now there are apps that take all the guesswork out of meeting someone you'd actually want to spend time with, and the latest entrant into this field is WannaMeet The application provides a platform for free dating experience. Let's take a look at what the app offers you and how it stacks up in the already-crowded field of social networking.
Features

Price: There is no charge to download the app onto your smartphone or tablet, which is always a plus. Nothing worse than spending money on an app that doesn't add anything to your social life, and actually makes you pay for the privilege of being disappointed.

English is the primary language, but WannaMeet Also offers Arabic, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Italian.

Location: WannaMeet! Pings your location and shows you other members within your geographic area who may be of interest to you. The app's GPS works throughout the world, so even if you're traveling out of town, you'll still be able to socially interact with other WannaMeet! Application users.
Matchmaking: After you've entered your profile information, including any kind of sexy, pensive or playful photo, the application lets you surf through the profiles and photos of the other WannaMeet users. If you find someone interesting while you're surfing, you click on a rectangular box at the bottom of your phone that says WannaMeet' Then you wait to see if the person you've asked to meet hits you back, at which point, you'll see a message at the top of your phone that says, It's a match!' followed by the name of the person you're interested in and a message that he wants to meet you as well.
