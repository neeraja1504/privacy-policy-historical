You may also provide us with information about yourself if you correspond or otherwise interact with us on behalf of an organization. We will use this information in order to fulfill your (or your organization's) requests for our products and services, and to respond to your inquiries. To this extent, we process your information in the performance of the contract between us and as part of our general business operations. If you do not provide us with the necessary personal data, we may not be able to provide the requested services to you and/or your organisation.
Marketing and advertising We will only process your information in order to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You can choose to unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of the email, or by emailing us at marketing@wandisco.com. If you do so, we will not send you any more marketing messages, although the messages we sent you prior to unsubscribing will still be lawful.
Information provided to us by your organization If we provide services to your organization, your organization may send us information about you. This may include information such as your name, work address, e-mail address, job title, telephone number, fax number and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. We will use this information in order to provide the services we have agreed with your organization.
We will process this information in order to perform the contract agreed between us and your organization. It is also important for us to have sufficient information to perform our services and administer our business effectively.
Information that is collected automatically We, and our partners and vendors, may collect certain information automatically when you visit many of our web pages or when you use our software and services, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the IP address of your computer, the amount and type of data replicated, and other information related to your use of our software and services. We use this automatically-collected information to improve the design and content of our site and our software and services. We may also use this information in the aggregate (i.e. in a way that does not identify you) to analyze usage of our site, software and services, including through our partners and vendors. We may also use this information to provide advertisements to you and for our own marketing purposes.
Many of our web pages use 'cookies'. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), and save your password in password-protected areas.
We use the following cookies:
Google tag manager
Facebook Lead - Contact Specialist
Facebook Pixel Base Code
Kickfire.com
LinkedIn Insight
Universal Analytics
We also use our own cookies from wandisco.com, or svnforum.org (and hadoop-forum / gitforums ) to facilitate login etc.
We collect and process this automatically-collected information because it is in our interests as a business to make sure that our website functions smoothly and effectively. If you reject our site's cookies, or have turned cookies off in your browser, you will still be able to use the site, but you may find that the site does not function optimally or that certain aspects of its functionality are impaired.
If you have registered an account with us (either on your own behalf or on behalf of an organization), we may use your personal data to provide you with certain communications such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the services that you (or your organization) have requested from us and you cannot opt out of these emails.
Service providers
We will share your personal information with our trusted third party service providers where we need to do so in order to provide you (our your organization) with the services you have requested, or where necessary for our legitimate business administration purposes. Such third parties include our payment processor; the company that provides our client record management tools; our mailing list administration software; our lead management service provider; our partners and vendors who make our software and services available to you and your organization. In accordance with the law
On rare occasions, we may release personal data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, regulation or legal request; to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WANdisco, our employees, our users, or others.
Business transfers
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. If WANdisco or substantially all of its assets were acquired (such as through a merger or acquisition), or in the unlikely event that WANdisco goes out of business or enters bankruptcy or is dissolved or otherwise reorganised, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. In any of these events, we consider that it would be in the legitimate interests of WANdisco (or our creditors or transferee(s)) that the relevant customer information be transferred.
Agents and contractors of WANdisco who have access to personal information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for WANdisco. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data, and unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
Third party websites
Our site contains links to other sites, and our services may be offered by partners or vendors, whose information practices may be different than ours. Please consult all third party sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, third parties.
We do not knowingly market or provide our services to children, and our services (including this website) are not designed for use by persons under 18 years old. Children under 18 are not allowed to register with or use our services, or to submit personal data to us. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will delete that information as soon as reasonably possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a person under age 18, please contact us at marketing@wandisco.com.

require us to rectify the personal data we hold about you, where that data is incorrect;
require that we restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances;
request access to the personal data that we hold about you;

require that we provide you with the information that we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;
