However, this Policy does not apply to information customers or users (“users”, “you,” or “your”) may process when using our Services.
The information we collect includes “personal data,” which is any information about an identifiable individual, as further set forth in this Policy. Wasabi is the sole owner of the information collected on the Sites or through your use of the Services. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy.
Further, Wasabi respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data in line with the General Data Protection Regulation – Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). This Policy will inform you as to how we will look after your personal data when you interact with us, including visiting our Sites. It also tells you about your rights in relation to your personal data.
We recommend that you read this Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed regarding our privacy practices. If you have any questions about this Policy or Wasabi’s data collection, use, and disclosure practices, please contact us at privacy@wasabi.com.

H. International Transfers – Wasabi has offices and provides Services both within and without the United States.

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please contact us https://wasabi.com/legal/privacy-policy/#contact if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information (however, in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms).
• request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
