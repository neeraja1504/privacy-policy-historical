Privacy Policy
Welcome to WacoTrib.com, home of the Waco Tribune-Herald Online Edition.
We understand that privacy is very important to our readers. We want to make sure that you understand why we collect certain information, how we use it, and how we protect it. We want our guests to feel confident that their information is handled with great care on WacoTrib.com.
How do I know my information is safe on WacoTrib.com?
In the normal course of business, WacoTrib.com and the Waco Tribune-Herald do not share reader information with anyone. We collect this information for the sole purpose of improving WacoTrib.com and providing more and better services to our readers.
The only times we will divulge a guest's personal information to a third party are:
If we believe in good faith that the law requires such disclosure.
If we need to disclose the information in order to identify, contact or initiate legal action against someone violating WacoTrib.com's Terms of Service, or someone who is causing injury to or interference with WacoTrib.com's rights or property, other WacoTrib.com users, or anyone else who can be harmed by such activities.
In the event WacoTrib.com contracts with an outside research firm, we may provide your contact information to the research firm to contact you regarding participation in surveys, focus groups or other research activities that will help us improve WacoTrib.com's products and services. The research firm will be bound by its contract with WacoTrib.com to use your information strictly for WacoTrib.com research purposes, to keep your information confidential, and to adequately secure or destroy its records of your information when the research is complete.
We may also use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our third party service providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a non-personally identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our affiliates and/or marketing partners for the same purposes.

If you contact WacoTrib.com, we may keep a record of your correspondence.
WacoTrib.com also tracks and collects computer IP addresses to help with system administration and to compile information about traffic patterns on the site. Computer IP addresses identify computers and the networks or Internet service providers to which they are connected.
Cookies and how WacoTrib.com uses them
A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred from a Web server through your browser and stored on the hard drive of your computer. The cookie contains your user name and password so that when you log on, the Web server recognizes you.
Some advertisers on WacoTrib.com may use their own cookies. When you click on an advertisement, visit an advertiser's Web site or make a purchase from an advertiser, that company may use cookies according to their own policies. Advertisers' cookies are not covered under WacoTrib.com's policy.
You do not have to permit the use of cookies. You can, through the options in your Web browser, choose to accept all cookies, choose to reject all cookies or choose to receive notification when a cookie is being delivered so that you can make a decision whether to accept each cookie on a case-by-case basis. If you refuse all cookies WacoTrib.com will no longer remember you when you return requiring you to log in each time you visit the site.
General statistical information
Visits to WacoTrib.com are monitored to gather statistical information, including the number of visits to the site, the pages visited, which domains visitors come from and the browsers used to visit the site. This data is accumulated at the aggregate level.
This statistical information enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of the services we provide, to monitor site performance and to make it easier for visitors to use the site.
How does WacoTrib.com use the information it gathers?
Information collected on WacoTrib.com, including traffic patterns and user behavior, is used primarily for the following purposes:
Internal research. WacoTrib.com is continuously assessing how visitors use the site. This data assists us in making decisions about how to improve the site and to better serve our users. Research data are aggregated and do not include data about specific individuals. We may share aggregated research (but not individual user information) with our advertisers or business partners. Additionally, WacoTrib.com may use your information to contact you to ask for your participation in a focus group, survey, or some other type of research effort.
To customize your experience on WacoTrib.com. As WacoTrib.com improves its service, it may offer users more opportunities to customize content and other aspects of the site. Information provided by you may be used to assist in the customization process, if you elect to participate in these features.
To tailor advertising efforts. Most of the information and services available to you at WacoTrib.com are free. In order to continue providing services free of charge, WacoTrib.com sells advertising. Advertisers prefer to target their communication toward audiences who are most likely to be interested in their products. The information gathered on WacoTrib.com helps us advise advertisers in general terms about certain aspects of site visitors (e.g. how visitors use the site, general demographic attributes of visitors, usage patterns on various parts of our site, etc.). This information helps both advertisers and WacoTrib.com make better decisions about where to place advertising. No specific information about individual users is ever provided to advertisers. However, visitors who choose to conduct financial transactions with advertisers on WacoTrib.com may provide specific data to those advertisers during the process of their transactions. Additionally, any information provided during the purchase of WacoTrib.com or the Waco Tribune-Herald products or services will result in the collection of certain information required to complete the transaction.
More specifically, here is how WacoTrib.com may use information you provide:
E-mail addresses. If you supply WacoTrib.com with your e-mail address, either by registering on the site or by communicating with us via e-mail, we may, from time to time, send you information that we believe would be of interest to you via e-mail. This information may be from WacoTrib.com, the Waco Tribune-Herald, or from one of our quality advertisers. Note: If we send you e-mail on behalf of another company, your information is never disclosed to that company. Rather, the company provides us with the information it wants to send, and we prepare and send the e-mail directly to you. Your information never leaves our systems.
Postal addresses. If you supply WacoTrib.com with your postal address, we may send you periodic mailings with information on new products, coming events, surveys or other research materials, or other information we think might be of interest to you.
Telephone numbers. If you provide your telephone number, WacoTrib.com may call you regarding orders you have placed online, to tell you about new products, services, or coming events, or to offer other information that may interest you. Additionally, WacoTrib.com, the Waco Tribune-Herald or one of their agents may call you for research purposes.
