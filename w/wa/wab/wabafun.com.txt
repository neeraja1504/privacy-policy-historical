Privacy Policy
Relevant Play will not share your information with any third party company, including email marketing firms. Your personal information will be kept secure and confidential in our database purely for our own marketing purposes. If you wish to be excluded from occasional emailings from Relevant Play (the company that sells Kinetic Sand, Mad Mattr, Bubber, and ShapeIt! Sand), please send us a note to info@relevantplay.com . Thank you!
What We Know About You
If you register an account with Relevant Play weâ€™ll have access to your e-mail address and any additional contact information you choose to provide us. If you place an order, we retain a record of the contents of the order, delivery and billing address information, and any communication you might have with our Customer Service or Tech Support teams about the order. If you use features such as commenting, in-stock notifications, and comment reply notifications, we retain record of this fact.
If you browse relevantplay.com, with or without a login, we know for a limited time that a user at your IP address has visited pages on the site.
We collect data on what products and content you browse in order to offer better value to you through personalized email, and to see which products/content are the most useful to you.
When and How We Send Email
We send mail to users when orders are placed, shipped, or ready for local pickup. We may also be in contact when an order requires payment before shipping, or if other issues prevent us from fulfilling an order.
We offer a set of opt-in email subscriptions for things such as newsletters, in-stock notifications for products, and comment reply notifications. You can control your subscriptions (when logged into your account) on the Email Notifications page. All new customers are signed up to our main newsletter by default, and SparkFun may at any time add all new and all existing customers to existing and new newsletters at our discretion.
We may occasionally send you an email that you did not request or trigger with an action of any kind in order to promote a certain aspect of our site, products, or services.
When you talk to our support
If you email us, chat with us, or call us on the telephone for support we can and most of the time will record the interaction. This is done so for training and audit purposes and the private conversations between customers and support staff are never sold to or shared with third parties (except when a third party tool, such as email or our chat service, is used to make the interaction possible). To reach our Customer Service department or contact our closest office to you, please reference the Contact Us page of this site.
Does Relevant Play use 'Cookies' on the site?
Relevant Play, like virtually all e-commerce sites today, occasionally issues 'cookies' to create a more effective and convenient site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user for a particular website. Relevant Play does not store any sensitive information in the cookie, but the cookie can be used to allow Relevant Play to offer unique functionality on the site. Relevant Play also stores your name in a cookie file, so Relevant Play can give you a personal greeting when you come back to the website.
Surveys
In the future, the Relevant Play website may request information from users via surveys. Participation in those surveys is voluntary and the user has a choice to disclose or not disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, personal preferences, etc.). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and effectiveness of the site.
