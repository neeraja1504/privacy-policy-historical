What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from
We collect most information directly from you when you order or buy from us. We get technical details from the devices you use to access our apps and websites and from cookies which tell us what you look at online, where and when. Like most other websites, our technology also lets us know when and how you use our websites, such as when you have added to or abandoned your basket or filled in a form.
The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it. We will only collect the personal information we believe we need to use, or which you have agreed we can collect from you or agreed someone else can share with us, such as Unidays to confirm student status.
Sometimes we are given information about you unexpectedly, such as from the police, organisations and agencies trying to prevent threats and fraud, and from the public.

What we do with your personal information
We need to collect and use lots of information about you so that you can use our websites and apps, shop in our stores, buy things from us and learn about our offers and new arrivals. We also need to use some details to prevent and detect fraud.
We look at and learn from your browsing, shopping and how you respond to our marketing to understand what sort of customer you are and predict what products we have that you may also be interested in. We try to show you adverts and offers we think you will like tailored to you based on stuff like your location, including what we know about you including through our apps, websites and other websites you visit, relying on the extra understanding about you which ad providers and social media platforms have collected with your consent.
Our use of your details will depend on you and what you are doing: browsing or buying, if you are new to us or a registered customer. Use will be different on-line and in-store but we will try to join up details of our relationship with you in store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online. We explain our lawful reasons for use of your personal information in our detail section. You can access this by scrolling to “Additional Details”.

Who we share your personal information with and why
We use suppliers and service providers, such as for delivering orders, or dealing with card checks and payments. These include other group companies and external contractors. We only share the personal details they need to know for their services and we make sure your privacy is respected and protected.
We share personal information with third parties when you have told us that we can share, or them that they can share, or you agree we can share your information, such as when you register to use a ‘Style adviser’ function we offer which is provided by a third party, or with third party ad providers, such as social media platforms or Google, so our adverts are shown to you.  We will share agreed details with third parties like Newday if you choose to use their store card, or Klarna if you choose to use their payment service, for the purpose of enabling the service which you have sought to use.
We will provide personal information about you to the police, fraud prevention and credit reference agencies when we have to by law, or when we deem necessary to prevent fraud.  If we decide to reorganise or sell all or most of our business, your personal information may be transferred to the buyer of the business but we will never sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you.

Where we send your personal information outside Europe
Business for us and many suppliers is international so your personal information may, at times, be handled in a location outside Europe. When this occurs, we take care in ensuring the security of your information. In the event you ask us to deliver your order outside of Europe, we need to send limited details outside of Europe to fulfil this request.
Click here to read more.
How do we keep your personal information secure
Our people understand how important it is to keep your personal information safe and secure. We take steps  online and in store  to keep our stores and offices, systems and records secure.
Click here to read more
How long we keep your information and why
We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This period will depend on a number of reasons, such whether we still need to deliver to you, or you have an account with us, or we are providing ongoing customer care to you. Sometimes we must also keep your information by law, to deal with a regulator or where required by our insurers. We delete your personal information at your request where possible and we won’t keep it for longer than we should or need to for the provision of a service and for communicating with you.
Your rights and how to use them
You have rights to find out about how and why we use your personal information and to control its use. These include rights to access and correct your details, in some cases to ask us to limit or stop our use of them and even to delete them.  Where we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to change your mind and you can always unsubscribe from our direct marketing to you, by simply clicking unsubscribe in a marketing email, or in this policy.
Your privacy matters, so we have appointed a Data Protection Officer and have a Data Protection Team to help. You can get in touch with our Customer Care team for help with data protection matters at Customer.service@wallis.co.uk. You also have a right to complain to the UK’s privacy regulator should you feel your rights or the law has been compromised.

Concessions
Where you shop in one of our concessions in another retailer’s store, their systems will check and take and record payment, operate CCTV and security and Wi-Fi. They will provide us with details of your purchases for our records. Unusually, if you are involved in any suspected incident, they may share additional details with us to help us together to prevent and detect crime.
Cookies
So we are clear, cookies are the nickname for tiny text files which some websites pages place on the device you use to access them, to give us encrypted information such as to remember what you have put in your basket when shopping, your preferences, whether you have an account and what cookies you have accepted. They will not collect your name, address and payment card details but send back technical facts.  They also help us to understand and sort out technical errors which sometimes happen online. We need cookies to make our websites and your device able to work well together. Some cookies are our own but we also work with carefully selected third parties to help us and who set their cookies from our website pages and to help us run our websites (these are called third party cookies).  You will not be able to buy from us online and your browsing experience may not be as enjoyable if you block your device from receiving cookies.
We use cookies online to do the job a good sales assistant does in store, noting what you are interested in, seeing if we can help show you where those items are, find more like them and tell you about products which work well with them. We can also tell you about special offers and promotions, just like they would.
Personal information does not include information where your identity has been removed or is unknown (anonymous data).  Some of this information may only be identifiable to you and personal because you are logged in to your account, or because we have collected details of your IP address or the device that you have used to access the website. Where we can, we prefer to show you adverts online which you are more likely to be interested in.
Normally until you buy from us, you are an unnamed user of our website but we want to make you a customer. We work with online advertising partners to do this. They set a cookie from our webpages and this allows them to spot when you use the same device on other websites they publish ads on. They can then make sure you see an ad from us (retargeting). In some cases, the ads you see from us online will be more tailored to you (tailored or behavioural ads). This uses known and observed information about you to try and categorise you and predict what you will want to buy and which offers you will most like (profiling). This will be from our knowledge of you as a customer with us and from your use of our websites but we do not share that detailed information with those advertising partners. In other cases, it will be based on what advertising partners /social media providers know about you from their cookies and use of their websites but we do not receive the detailed information from these websites.
You can get more information about cookies and can change your mind about cookies at any time. if you want more details or to change your mind, see our cookies policy.
What we do with your personal information
We need to collect and use lots of information about you and any devices you use to access our apps or websites for many different reasons but we will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. This will always be for one of these reasons (our lawful basis):
Legal basis
|
When we use this basis
---|---
Contract
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for a contract reason (to comply with a contract with you, or take steps you have requested to start a contract with you).
Legal obligation
|
This is where we must use your personal information to comply with the law, or a binding request like a court order.
Consent
|
This is where we use your personal information with your clear consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.
Public interest
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for an official purpose, or for a reason in the public interest for the greater public good, like cooperating voluntarily with an official police investigation.
Vital interests
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm.
Legitimate interests
|
This is where, on balance and being fair to you, we have (or a third party has) another good and lawful business reason for using your personal information and we do not need your consent.
By law we must treat special category or sensitive personal data, such as on health or alleged crimes, with even more care and must have an additional reason for collecting and using this type of personal information. Where special categories of sensitive personal information are involved in addition our use will always be for one of these reasons.
Legal basis
|
When we use this basis
---|---
Legal obligation
|
This is where we must use your personal information to comply with your or our legal rights or obligations related to employment or social protection.
Preventative medicine
|
This is where we need to use your personal information for medical diagnosis or preventative health reasons
Substantial public interest
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in the substantial public interest for the greater public good.
Explicit consent
|
This is where we use your personal information with your very clear and express consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.
Legal claims
|
This is where we need to use your personal information to investigate, take advice on bring or defend legal claims.
Vital interests
|
This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm and you are not capable of giving your consent.
We want you to understand why we use the personal information we do and our legal basis for doing so. We explain this here.
Where we can, we will also move from using your information in ‘individual picture’ form about you, to ‘big picture’ form as a member of a group but not as an individual. To do this, we can bunch lots of information on individuals together (aggregation), remove or change details that identify you to make that more difficult or impossible (de-identification, pseudonymisation and anonymization) and change information about people into information about numbers (statistics). This helps us to protect your privacy whilst having the information we need to run our business and comply with our obligations. We can use the details for research, statistical analysis, and reports.

Where we send your personal information outside Europe
Data privacy laws in the UK and across the countries in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, (the European Economic Area) are very similar.  We have called this area ‘Europe’ for ease. If it is necessary for us to transfer your personal information outside Europe we will only make that transfer if we use a method approved as privacy-safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe:, including:
the country to which the personal information is to be transferred has been approved by them;
the recipient of the personal information is in the USA and has certified they will comply with the Privacy Shield rules to protect personal information, approved by them;
the recipient of the personal information is legally bound to protect your personal information under binding corporate rules approved by them;
we have made sure that there is a contract to protect your personal data with the recipient, using a template approved by them;
the transfer is needed for another reason approved by them, such as to make an international delivery at your request; or
where you explicitly consent to the transfer
You can ask for a copy of the method approved as privacy safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe from our Customer Care team or Data Protection Team using the contact details in section 8 below.
How do we keep your personal information secure
We take specific steps required by data privacy law to take appropriate care of your personal information, whether online or not. This is to protect it against theft or other loss, being corrupted so we cannot use it properly or at all and to stop people who should not be able to see or use it from doing so.
How long we keep your information and why
We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This will depend on a number of factors, including:
whether you have placed an order with us, or have a registered account with us;
any laws or regulations that we are required to follow;
whether we are dealing with a current request, customer care issue or complaint;
where there is a legal or other type of dispute involving or affecting you;
the type of information that we hold about you; and
whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal data for a valid reason.
We will keep your personal information during the period that you are a customer with us and then for as long as is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations. This may mean that we keep some types of personal information for longer than others. Generally, if you are an inactive customer we will remove your account after 18 months.
Your rights and how to use them
You have rights to understand and control use of your personal information. These rights only apply to your own personal information. For all these rights:
we must be able to verify your identity;
your request must not impact the privacy rights of other people;
Your request must not be excessive, very unreasonable or repeated [too often].
They cannot clash with the provision of a service (for example submitting a right to erasure when we are processing an order from you)
Many rights have limitations and exceptions, for instance, we do not have to provide you with legally privileged advice involving your personal information.

Your Personal Stylist - Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
Stylemania Limited, trading as Dressipi (for more information about us see the About Us section below), (“Dressipi”) operates the Your Personal Stylist Service which is available via this website (the “Service”).  Dressipi is committed to protecting your personal information when you use our “Service” and we want our Members and visitors to have a safe and enjoyable experience.  It is completely optional to use the Your Personal Stylist Service (and become a Member), but if you choose to do so, you will be required to undertake the Your Personal Stylist profiler and enter certain personal data about yourself. To become a Member you will be required to set up an account with a password, email address, date of birth, gender, location and various clothes size information.
Dressipi is legally obliged to only hold and use your personal information in line with the Data Protection Act 1998 and related laws (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the ‘data protection laws’).
The Service contains links to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy and cookie policies and we urge you to review them. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
2. What Information Will Dressipi Collect About Me?
A. Unregistered Users
We encourage you to save the answers and information you provided when you created your Your Personal Stylist profile in order to to take full advantage of all the features of the Service detailed below. However, you may choose not to register and take advantage of any feature of the Service where registration is not required.
If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our applications or hosting environments, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. It would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you accessed the Service by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.
We also place small files known as ‘cookies’ (and/or similar technology) on your computer’s hard drive to maintain the integrity of our content and to provide our users with a better site experience. Please see below for more information about cookies.
B.  Users who have registered with Your Personal Stylist (‘Members’)
If you choose to register with Your Personal Stylist, you will be provided with personalised clothes and styling recommendations, relating to Wallis products and services.  The benefits of registering will increase over time as we get to know you better and introduce new features. We encourage you to register so that you can experience everything that Dressipi has to offer.
Upon registration, we will collect personal information from you including your name, email address, gender, birthday, location, clothes sizes and password.  We may also give you the opportunity to add optional information about yourself.  Finallly you will be given the chance to sign up to receive fortnightly Personal Stylist emails recommending new Wallis products for you and to receive Wallis’ newsletter by email (including exclusive offers, competitions and style advice).
We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit.
C.  Purchases from Wallis
If you choose to purchase any clothing or accessories recommended to you by Your Personal Stylist by clicking on a link to the website of Wallis, Wallis will collect your personal details (such as your credit card number, address, etc.) for the purpose of completing your chosen transaction.  We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with Wallis and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. For further information on how Wallis collect and process your personal information and how to manage your preferences please read the Wallis privacy policy wallis.co.uk.
3. How will Dressipi use the Information?
A.  To Personalise the Way Content is Presented to You
As part of the Your Personal Stylist registration process you will be given the option of saving the answers and information you have provided. Having selected various options (and any options that we may add to in the future), Dressipi will create your automated style preferences which enables Dressipi to tailor and match the content presented to you so that the recommendations you receive are personalised according to our machine learning algorithms.
B.  To Contact You
We will use the email address and any other relevant contact details provided by you when you register, to contact you from time to time.  This may be for security reasons (so that we can check that you are who you say you are, by sending you an initial validation email); to inform you about planned maintenance which will affect the Service or other disruptions; to ask your opinion about the Service; or it may be to keep you updated on the services currently available  from Your Personal Stylist; and any changes to those services and those that we intend to launch in the future.
We may also contact you about any submission you have made to the Service, including any content you provide and to invite you to participate in surveys about Dressipi services (participation is always optional).
Wallis
Where you have agreed to this upon registration, we will send your name and email address to Wallis so that they can send you fortnightly emails recommending new Wallis products or contact you about  their products and services that they think may be of interest to you based on your use of the Service, or to deliver targeted advertisements, promotions and other similar initiatives to you. We may also share your name and email address with Wallis to enable them to analyse the use of the Service, its effectiveness and for other purposes of improving their products and services and website.
C.  Monitoring and Editing User Content
Where in the future we allow users to submit reviews or provide other content as part of the Service we will require users to comply with Terms of Use.  We may, but have no obligation to, monitor such content via electronic software or otherwise in order to check for obscenity, defamation, unlawful acts, abusive or inappropriate language or other breaches of those Terms of Use.
D.  Statistical Analysis
We may use your information in order to generate anonymous statistics regarding use of the Service. We may share this anonymous information with our partners and advertisers, including Wallis. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
E.  Third party suppliers
We may need to share your information with third party suppliers that support the Service such as our web hosting provider (all your information) and Wallis’ email marketing provider (your name and email address only, and only where you have opted in to receive such marketing as described in Section 2B above).
F.  Third–Party Adservers
We may use third–party advertising companies to target and serve ads when you use the Service. These companies may use information (this will not include your name, address – though possibly the location of your home town–, or email address) about your use of the Service and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and other tracking technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personal information to them through an ad or email message). See our cookie policy below for more information.
4. Will Dressipi Share my Information With Anyone Else?
We will keep your information confidential except as set out above or where disclosure is required or permitted by law.
If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere connected with the Service, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour regarding the Service, Dressipi may use your personal information to stop such behaviour. Where Dressipi reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any of applicable law (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), Dressipi may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
If Dressipi is acquired by another company or sells all or a portion of its assets to another company, or in the event of a merger or reorganisation, it is likely that user information will be a part of the assets transferred and may be disclosed to the new company.
5. Children
Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to use the Service and must not attempt to register with Dressipi and/or submit any personal information to us. We don’t knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 18, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at unsubscribe@dressipi.com, and we will delete all relevant information.
6. How to Remove Details, Stop Marketing Emails and Update Your Personal Information
You may have your registration details, including your profile, removed at any time. To remove yourself from Dressipi altogether, please email us at unsubscribe@dressipi.com and we will endeavour to remove your details within 7 days of receipt of the email.  To simply opt out of receiving marketing materials from Your Style Advisor please email us at [Wallisunsubscribe@dressipi.com].
You can review and update the personal information you have provided through the registration process by clicking on ‘My Profile’ on your account page.
7. Security/How Long Will Dressipi Hold Personal Information
We employ firewalls and store all of our files and information on computer hardware which require password access. You should never disclose your account password to unauthorised people. We use certain security measures to help keep your personal information safe, but we cannot guarantee that these measures will stop any users try to get around the privacy or security settings through unforeseen and/or illegal activity. Consequently, you acknowledge that there are circumstances in which your personal information may be accessed by unauthorised persons.
In the event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavour to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e–mail address, we may notify you by e–mail.
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary to provide the Service. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a Your Personal Stylist member, your account will be deleted but once an account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.
Where you contribute reviews or other content to the Service, Dressipi will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.
8. Changes to this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to the Service. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.
9. Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a ‘device’) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

We use these cookies to identify you as a valid user and to help personalise your Dressipi experience in conjunction with your profile. We currently employ persistent cookies which stay on your computer after you have gone offline. Persistent cookies remain in the ‘cookies” folder after you have closed your web browser.
Most browsers have cookies turned on as a default, but you can always disable cookies or only allow non–persistent cookies via your browser preferences. If you choose to disable cookies, however, you won’t be able enjoy a significant proportion of Dressipi’s functionality. Please remember that cookies cannot read your hard drive or give any information collected to any third party. A cookie can only be read by the organisation that sets it.
10. Can I Find Out What Personal Information Dressipi Holds About Me?

(We charge £10 for information requests and will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.)

Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy to privacy@dressipi.com.
11. About Us
Dressipi is a free fashion advice and recommendation service. We give you the know-how to dress your shape and update your style – and a quick and easy way to find the best clothes and brands for you.
