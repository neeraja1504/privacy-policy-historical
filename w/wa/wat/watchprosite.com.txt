Cookies New Updates
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Pubzap LLC and Puristspro LLC (herinafter HOST) we have a few fundamental principles:
We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.
Pubzap LLC & Puristspro LLC. ("HOST") operates several websites including www.HOST.com, www.watchprosite.com and www.puristspro.com. It is HOST's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, HOST collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. HOST's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how HOST's visitors use its website. From time to time, HOST may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
HOST also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. HOST only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to HOST's websites choose to interact with HOST in ways that require HOST to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that HOST gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at watchprosite.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with HOST - by purchasing access to a service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, HOST collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with HOST. HOST does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
HOST may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. HOST uses tracking software to monitor its visitors to better understand how they use it. This software is provided by Google Analytics which uses cookies to track visitor usage. The software will save a cookie to your computers hard drive in order to track and monitor your engagement and usage of the website, but will not store, save or collect personal information. You can read Google's privacy policy here for further information [ http://www.google.com/privacy.html ].
For instance, HOST may monitor the most popular posts on the watchprosite.com site. HOST may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, HOST does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
HOST discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on HOST's behalf or to provide services available at HOST's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using HOST's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. HOST will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, HOST discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when HOST believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of HOST, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an HOST website and have supplied your email address, HOST may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with HOST and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. HOST takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
