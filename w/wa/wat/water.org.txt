Credit Card Information:
Water.org is grateful for the donations that help us continue our valuable work. It is very important to us that your personal information remains secure. When you donate to Water.org online, your credit card information is secured by a reputable security company (Verisign). Also, your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored. You will see the “closed” lock symbol in the lower part of your browser screen (often times it is yellow as well) when you are on our secure donation pages. You will also notice in your website address bar that the domain name starts with an “https” on those donation pages. This means that information entered on those pages is encrypted for your security. If you have any questions regarding the security of your credit card donation online, please contact us or call (816) 877-8400 for more information.
