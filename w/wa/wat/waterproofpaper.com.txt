Privacy Information
Visitor Information Logged
Our server logs each visit to our site and records the pages that have been viewed. We use this information to understand how visitors engage our website and to enable us to make informed decisions about improving the experience of our visitors. The logs do not contain information about visitors that would identify them personally. Similar information is collected by the server of almost every commercial website.
Information collected includes:
URL web addresses that send traffic to our website (these are search engines, social media sites and other websites that included a link to our website)
The search queries that visitors use to arrive at our site
IP addresses (a unique number assigned to a computer when it connects to the Internet) of visitors that enter our website
The types of browsers (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox) used to access our site
The operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site
The date, time and duration for each visitor's access
The URLs of pages viewed by each visitor
We do not share the contents of our visitor log files with anyone outside of our company. The only reason that we would release this information is if it is requested by a law enforcement or government agency for the purpose of an essential investigation.
We also use the GetClicky.com and CrazyEgg.com services to learn how visitors use our website. These services collect information similar to the server logs described above but they also include information about where visitors click on our site, the internet service providers used by visitors and the click paths used by visitors who checkout in our shopping cart. This information helps us understand how visitors use our website and we use that information to improve the design of our site in ways that facilitate visitor engagement and sales.
Information Voluntarily Provided by Visitors
We welcome feedback about our website and respond to information requests from visitors each day. These communications are done by email messages initiated by our website visitors. We will use the information associated with your message to prepare a reply but information about your identity is not shared with anyone outside of our company.

How Credit Cards are Processed
Our website has a store where visitors can make purchases. The shopping cart of this store operates through the use of session cookies. These cookies are small files that are placed on a visitor's computer to allow that computer to temporarily remember information about an order in progress. These cookies contain information that allows our shopping cart to remember which items have been selected for purchase. No personal information is contained within the cookie and they expire when the shopper restarts his/her computer.
Session cookies expire over time. If you place items in a shopping cart tonight and return tomorrow to complete the purchase the items might be gone from the cart.
In the checkout process the visitor must type in name, address, email and credit card information. This information is transmitted by secure connections to Ultracart.com (our shopping cart provider). The information is then transmitted through credit card processors to the website visitor's credit card bank. This information is only used to complete the credit card transaction, complete a fraud check, ship the merchandise to the visitor and communicate with the visitor about the status of an order.
During the checkout process the customer can check a box that will invite us to send them information about sales or special offers. We are the only user of this information and we never share customer purchase information with anyone outside of our business. Ultracart.com and our credit card processors have similar policies and do not release any information about our customers.

When we link to a website, we always review that site to be sure that it has quality content and to be sure that it is a site that we would recommend to our colleagues, friends, and members of our family. We do not control the content of these websites and encourage any visitor to contact us if you feel that one of these sites contains information that is unsuitable for visitors of any age.

Ads Displayed on this Website
Google Ads
Most of the ads that we display are sent to our website through the Google Adsense program. Google has a privacy policy for ads that explains the information obtained through their advertising and how that information is handled. Visitors can also learn how Google ads are customized to match their potential interests via the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
All of Google's advertisers are required to comply with the Google Ad Content Policy. We regularly inspect the ads that appear on our site and believe that Google does a very good job of delivering ad content that matches the topics of our website and the potential interest of our visitors. In the few instances that we have seen an ad that contained questionable content we immediately installed manual filters to ban future ads from that advertiser's website.
Google and other advertisers on our site use technology such as cookies, web beacons or the DoubleClick DART Cookie. These send advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed or other viewing software installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). You can easily opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or online email accounts. These settings can also disable your ability to make purchases from our site and other ecommerce sites that use similar technology.
Private Placement Ads
We display a small number of ads promoting companies that have directly contracted with us. All contracted ads are approved by us and the advertiser's website is inspected at the beginning of each advertising term. Each of these ads leads to a website that we would recommend to our colleagues, friends and members of our own family.
Advertising Networks
We also display ads on our site that are delivered by ad networks that include TribalFusion.com and Adblade.com. These companies have technologies that try to match the ads that they deliver with with information that they obtain from cookies in your browser. The cookies contain information about your previous browsing history. For example, if you have visited their site in the past their ad might be displayed. Or, if you have visited a auto dealer site in the past an ad inviting you to an auto dealer site might be displayed.
