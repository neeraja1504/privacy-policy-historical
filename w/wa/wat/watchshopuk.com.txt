We may, sometimes, employ 3rd party companies for marketing purposes. In these cases, we may pass your name and email address on to a trusted 3rd party provider. Examples include sending e-mail newsletters, feedback requests and analysing data. The companies involved will not sell or lease your data, and will not market to you themselves.

We store your name, address and telephone number if you register for an account with us.  This is optional, but enables you to place further orders without having to enter your details again. Your details are also stored in relation to unregistered orders.
