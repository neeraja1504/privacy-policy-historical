Interest-Based Advertising
On our sites, apps and/or emails we and our third-party service providers may obtain information about your activities to provide you with advertising about our products and services tailored to your individual interests. Our third-party service providers also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites and apps. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
We engage third-party advertising networks to help us target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and contextual means on limited third party applications or websites. Through these ad networks, we can track your online activity on our Service over time by obtaining information through automated means, as described above. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests (for example, they might show you an advertisement for the Service if you have visited our site but have not acquired a subscription). The information our ad networks may obtain on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites and use of apps that serve our advertisements, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on those websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our sites, apps and emails and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

The Service may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially provided the information (e.g Australia or the EU), including the United States. If you are based in Australia, you consent to having any personal information accessible from or transmitted outside of Australia.
When your personal information is transferred to (or accessed from) a country outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected. This may include data transfer agreements, a copy of which you can obtain by contacting us as indicated in the "How To Contact Us" Section below.
However, your personal information may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of the recipient country in accordance with applicable law. When we transfer your personal information, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
