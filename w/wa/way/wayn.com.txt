5. Sharing and use of information
Any visitor to the WAYN Service anywhere in the world can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the WAYN.com community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the WAYN.com website and which network of WAYN.com members can see what information.
The over-riding principles we apply are these:
We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation except as consented to by you in accordance with prevailing law.
Profile Information. Once a Member selects a location, some or all of the information held for that Member, except for the email address, telephone numbers and passwords, will be publicly available at the listing for that location.
Your home location, in terms of your town / city, state / county and country, and any other location specific information you submit to the WAYN Service must be considered at all times to be publicly available information, save where you specify (in the Privacy options that apply to your profile) that you wish your profile only to be viewable by either Members or friends. In addition, if address details are submitted to the WAYN.com service they are not made publicly available.
Email addresses. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the WAYN Service. Similarly, when you send an email to another Member through the WAYN Service, neither the sender's nor the recipient's email address is disclosed by the WAYN Service itself. Members can, however, choose to make their email addresses known to other Members; however, WAYN does not recommend that you do so, and any such disclosure is at the Member's own risk. Members may change the email address we hold them at any time by visiting "Edit Personal Details", which is accessible from the Member's account settings found at the top of most pages when logged on to the WAYN Service. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email with a read or delivery receipt, your email address will be revealed. No tracking technologies are used within / in conjunction with emails nor do we share, sell, rent or trade Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their promotional purposes, except for where we have specifically partnered with a third party to provide enhanced services to members.
Un-validated Memberships. If you register for the WAYN Service, and you receive a validation email, but fail to validate your Membership then we may contact you via email at periods of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days at your registered email address to notify you of the invalid status. Should you fail to respond to these notifications then we may send you one final notice before the un-validated Membership is removed.
Advertising. The WAYN Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit the WAYN website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on the WAYN website, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.
Telephone numbers. You may enter a contact telephone number in your Personal Details. This number is for internal use only, for future or current services such as SMS. Your number will never be disclosed to any third party without your prior consent. Should we introduce an additional service which utilises telephone numbers, or we wish to provide you with informational content via your mobile phone, you will be given the option to agree to this, as we believe it should be your choice what services you receive.
Notification of unread messages. If you have a number of messages waiting for you in your WAYN mailbox, and you have not logged in to the service for an extended period, we may at our discretion contact you via your registered email address to notify you of the unread messages. Should you still not read and remove these messages then we may remove the messages as part of our data cleansing process.
Credit Card information. There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we work with the leading Merchant Providers in the industry who specialize in Fraud and Data Verification. These companies include Protx and Meta Charge. Members' credit or debit card information is encrypted and stored securely. We share your billing information with such companies insofar as necessary for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud. These companies have agreed not to retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.
WAYN companies and subsidiaries. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies owned by us, but only for the purposes described in this policy.
Changes in WAYN's business. If all of the assets which WAYN uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party.
Place of processing. The computers and companies that process data on our behalf are based in the United Kingdom, Poland and other countries, some of which may be outside the European Union ("EU"). Thus, your personal data (which may include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or concerning health or sex life) may be transferred to, processed and held both inside and outside the EU. Countries outside the EU may not have as well developed data protection laws in place to protect your information as those inside the EU, but we will ensure your personal data is treated in compliance with those laws and this Privacy Policy.
Outsourcing and Third Party Services From time to time we may employ, partner with, hire or licence third party companies to process, store or manage data on our behalf, to enable the usage of such services we may need to exchange data including members personal information, however, any such exchange of data will be limited to the minimum dataset required to enable processing and ownership of the data will remain with WAYN. These companies may be based within the United Kingdom, the European Union or other countries. Examples of such services may include, but not be limited to; Cloud Computing Services (Such as Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure), Email Processing services which will require us sharing your email address for the purpose of sending such emails (such as marketing tools or programs hosted on third party servers), Security Software services (such as fraud detection services), Website Acceleration Services(such as Content Delivery Networks). Countries outside the EU may not have as well developed data protection laws in place to protect your information as those inside the EU, but we will ensure your personal data is treated in compliance with those laws and this Privacy Policy. Where at all possible we will endeavour to ensure data is stored within the European Union.
6. Sharing Information
When you use the WAYN Service, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. [When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. You post a User Submission (as defined in the WAYN Terms and Conditions) on the WAYN Service at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Submissions you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Submissions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Submissions.
Where Are You Now? Ltd may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the WAYN.com service through the operation of the service (e.g. photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.
When you register for the WAYN Service, you can create your own profile and determine your own privacy settings.
Your name and profile picture thumbnail will be available in all search results across the WAYN.com network and may be searchable through third party web-sites with which we partner (such as sites for which we provide a social network service) and third party search engines, and may be automatically notified to third party tracking websites/weblogs; in each case, you can prevent this happening by specifying (in the Privacy options that apply to your profile) that you wish your profile only to be viewable by either Members or friends.
The fact that your WAYN profile has been added or updated, as well as a short extract from the title page of your WAYN profile, may be automatically notified to third party tracking websites/weblogs (thus increasing the traffic to the WAYN Service, and potentially to your own WAYN profile). This can also be prevented by specifying (in the Privacy options) that you wish your profile only to be viewable by either Members or friends. If you do so, this will prevent subsequent notifications to third party tracking websites/weblogs, but notifications prior to the time when you make the change to your profile's Privacy options may continue to appear on those websites/weblogs.
Your news feeds and friends feeds may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your news feeds at any time by adjusting your Privacy Settings.
