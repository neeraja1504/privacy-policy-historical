We share your information with the following categories of recipients as an essential part of being able to provide the Site, the App and related services, including customer service, to you:
Wayfair affiliates, including Wayfair LLC (Wayfair's parent company) in the USA. We share your information among our affiliates because each is responsible for different Wayfair activities. For example, Wayfair LLC directs and controls our global marketing and customer service activities. We share your information with Wayfair LLC so that we can provide our services to you.
Companies and individuals that help us deliver our products to you, such as suppliers, payment service providers, logistics professionals, and delivery and freight companies.
Professional service providers who help us run our business, such as marketing companies, software vendors, consultants, and advertising partners.
Companies approved by you, such as social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to us) and payment processors (such as Worldpay) or financing providers (such as Barclays) if you choose to use their service.
Government and law enforcement agencies, to (i) comply with a legal process, subpoena, order, or other legal or regulatory requirement; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use or other policies; or (iii) pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims.
We share your information with third parties only as described in this Privacy Notice, with your consent, and as disclosed at the time we collect your information. We may anonymize your information and share such anonymized information with third parties for any purpose permitted by applicable laws.
Financing Providers
If you chose to apply for a financing product offered by a financing provider (such as Barclays), we collect your financing information on behalf of that provider. Once you have completed the application form, we send the data to the financing provider and delete it immediately from our systems. We will not use your financing information for any other purpose.
Our cookie policy
We use cookies when you visit our Site and App to analyze the web traffic, to optimize the performance and content of the website and to promote trust and security. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your Internet browser on your computer. While our cookies may change from time to time, we generally use the following types of cookies:
Functionality cookies, which allow you to navigate the site and use our features.
Analytics cookies, which allow us to measure, analyze and understand how our customers use the Site, and to identify ways to improve both its functionality and your shopping experience. For example:
We use Google Analytics to help us evaluate your use of the Site, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. The information generated by the Google Analytics cookies is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, due to the activation of IP anonymization on this Site, your IP address will be shortened by Google prior to transferring it to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. You can prevent Google's collection of your information through the Google Analytics cookies by downloading and installing available browser plug-ins, for example the browser add-on for disabling Google Analytics.
We also use Criteo to help us collect and store information that we use to create pseudonymized profiles of our users. We use these profiles to analyze visitor behavior and improve and tailor our services. We do not merge or combine these pseudonymized profiles with any information about the user without a specific, express consent of the person concerned. To understand more about how Criteo helps us create these profiles, please visit Criteo's website at www.criteo.com/privacy to review its privacy policies.
Customer preference cookies, which help us remember your preferences (like your language or location) and make your experience more personalized to you.
Targeting or advertising cookies, which allow us to deliver digital ads relevant to you. These types of cookies also limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We use cookies to help us identify and retarget users who have already taken an interest in our products both on our Site and on third party websites. For example, we use proprietary technology to specifically target users by creating advertising material based on the users' previous behavior. To disable interest-based ads, please see Marketing and Behavioral Advertising below.
You can prevent the use of cookies by changing the settings in your web browser so that (i) it does not accept new cookies, (ii) it informs you about new cookies, or (iii) it deletes all already received cookies. By deleting or disabling future cookies, your user experience may be affected and you might not be able to take advantage of certain functions of our Site.
We also use web beacons (or "web bugs" or "clear GIFs") to help us identify your computer and evaluate user behavior, such as reactions to promotions. Web beacons are small GIF files that can be hidden in other graphics, emails, or similar. The information collected by web beacons cannot be used to identify you and are not associated with information on your computer or database. To prevent web bugs on our site, you can use tools such as AdBlock Plus. To prevent web bugs in emails, please set your mail program so that no HTML is displayed in messages. Web bugs are also prevented if you read your e-mail offline.
Marketing and behavioral advertising
If you provided your consent, we will send you marketing communications and materials by email and postal mail to keep you informed of new products, promotions, and other information we think may be of interest to you. You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time through your preferences here or by contacting us at DataProtectionOfficer@wayfair.com. To stop direct marketing messages you can also click on the "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email you receive from us. Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you do not receive further marketing messages from us. Please note that it may take up to 48 hours to process your request and update our systems. Note that if you request that we stop sending you marketing messages, we will not stop sending you administrative and services communications (such as order updates and other important or transactional information).
Please note that if you use more than one name or email address when communicating with Wayfair or using the Site of App, you may continue to receive communications from us to any name or email address not specified in your opt-out request.
We also engage in online behavioral advertising to enhance your experience and show you products that might interest you. Like many companies, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching or purchasing on the Site or the App, visiting sites that contain our content or ads, interacting with our tools, or using our payment services. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook's Custom Audience service.
We offer you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can opt-out of certain interest-based ads that use our cookies by clicking here. You can also opt-out of receiving some third-party interest based ads, or learn more about behavioral advertising, by visiting www.youronlinechoices.eu. Please note that if you opt out of behavioral advertising, you will still see advertisements - they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.
Blogs, reviews and forums
The Site and App also may from time to time offer publicly-accessible blogs, reviews or forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your information from blogs, customer reviews or forums, please see Your Rights and Choice below. Please note that in some cases we may be unable to remove your information.
The Site and the App use social plugins, which allow you to interact with us through your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media accounts. If you visit a page of our Site or App that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to that social media's webservers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by the social media site directly to your browser and incorporated by the social media site into the Site or App. By integrating the plugins, the social media site receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our Site or App, even if you do not have an account or are currently not logged in to your account. We have no control over the extent and use of information that the social media site collects using this plugin.
If you interact with a social media plugin by, for example, clicking a "Like" button or leaving a comment, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to the social media server and stored there. Depending on your settings, the information will also be posted on the social media site and displayed to your contacts or friends on the social media site. The social media site may use this information for the purpose of advertising, market research and tailor-made pages.
To understand what information social media sites collect when you interact with their plug-ins, please review their privacy policies. You may also have the option to change your settings in the social media site to prevent the collection of your information.
Our security measures
We use appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized use, disclosure, and loss. Data transmitted to Wayfair is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We use a PCI compliant secure credit card processor and do not save your full credit card number on our information systems while placing an order. If you have questions about the security of your information, please contact us at DataProtectionOfficer@wayfair.com.
We encourage you to protect your password and your computer to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window if you are using a shared computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet cafe.
Keeping your information
We will keep your information for as long as you have an account or as long as we need it to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or disclosed to you at the time of collection. We may also keep some of your information as required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud or abuse, enforce our Terms of Use, or for other legitimate business purposes (so long as keeping it for such purposes does not infringe upon your privacy rights).
When we no longer have a need to keep your information, we will either delete it from our systems or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you.
Your rights and choices
You have the following rights related to the information that we maintain about you:
The right to be informed about how your information is used. This is the reason we provide this Privacy Notice to you.
The right to access the information we hold about you.
The right to request the correction of inaccurate information we hold about you. You can correct some of this information in your account settings.
In some circumstances, the right to request that we delete your information, or stop processing it or collecting it.
The right to stop direct marketing messages, which you can do through your preferences here or by clicking on any "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email you receive from us. You also have the right to withdraw your consent for other processing activities for which you have given us your consent.
The right to request that we transfer your information either to you or a third party.
The right to complain to your data protection regulator.

Transfers outside of Europe
Wayfair is headquartered in the USA. While Wayfair Stores Limited is an independent entity, its operations, sales, and online presence are closely tied to Wayfair LLC (which is its parent company in the USA). As a result of this relationship, your information will be transferred to the USA to be processed by Wayfair LLC.
Wayfair LLC is a data controller and has committed to complying with this Privacy Notice and European privacy laws with regard to information transferred from Europe. The USA does not have a decision of adequacy from the European Commission, meaning that the laws in the USA may not be as protective as the laws in Europe. Because of this, Wayfair has taken steps to protect your rights when your information is transferred to the USA through the use of the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses.
Third party links
We may provide links to third-party web sites that we do not own or control. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third-party websites and do not endorse such practices. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of third-party websites before providing any information to or through them.
Children's privacy
The Site and the App are not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 16. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 16, we will take steps to obtain the consent of that child's parent or guardian prior to processing that child's information any further. If do not obtain the parent or guardian's consent, we will delete the child's information from our systems.
Changes to this Privacy Notice
We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect new ways that we process your information. If we make significant changes that affect your information, we will provide you notice of such changes through the Site, the App, by email, or some other means of contact. This notice will give you an opportunity to review the changes before we use your information in these different ways.

2. Terms of Sale
The following sets out the terms and conditions upon which we supply products to you. Where you are buying products as a consumer, nothing in these terms and conditions affects your legal rights, and we have a legal duty to supply products that conform to the contract between us. Further information regarding your legal rights can be found on the Citizens Advice website at www.adviceguide.org.uk.
Order Acceptance - If we accept your order, we will send you a confirmation of this by email. The receipt of an email order confirmation by you constitutes our acceptance of an order and the conclusion of a contract between us to sell the goods you have ordered, subject to these terms (the "Contract"). You should retain that email for your records. Whereas, following such acceptance, we will always seek to meet the requirements of your order, there may be circumstances following confirmation where we are unable to ship products due to unavailability (of which we were not aware at the time of confirmation of the order). If that is the case, we will notify you as soon as possible and will refund the money for the unavailable products back onto your card or into your account. If the payment process has not begun at that time, the money for such products will not be taken out of your account or from your card. Our acceptance does not therefore guarantee and is subject to the availability of products following the receipt of the confirmation email by you.
Our products - Prices and availability of products on the Site are subject to change without notice. While we endeavour not to make any errors on the Site and to ensure that the descriptions, details and dimensions of our products, our prices and other information about us or our products, are accurate and up to date, errors can occur. Errors will be corrected when discovered, and we reserve the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions (including after an order has been submitted). If we identify an error that materially impacts your confirmed order, we will notify you as soon as possible and will provide you with the option of cancelling your order in full or the part(s) of your order affected by the misinformation. If you make such a cancellation, the money for the cancelled part of your order will be refunded to your account or onto your card (or will not be taken at all if the payment process has not begun at that time). This in no way restricts or limits your ability to return the goods in line with our returns policy.
Prices and Payment – The price of the product will be as shown on the order pages when you place your order. Payment for the product is required on dispatch. If items are shipped in instalments, payment may be taken in instalments as each is product is dispatched (but will not exceed the order total). Where payment has not been received, we are under no obligation to deliver the product to you. Our invoice(s) for the price of the products you purchase are set out in the email order confirmation we send to you. You can also review and print these invoices at any time by logging in to "My Account" section of the Site. You should retain copies of the invoices for your records.
Delivery – Typical methods and costs of delivery are as shown here under the "Delivery Information" tab and are confirmed at checkout. We will give you an estimated date for delivery, and we will endeavour to deliver any products ordered within the estimated period and will deliver your order within 30 days of the Contract date unless otherwise agreed with you as stated in our email order confirmation (see Order Acceptance, above). Please note that some products require a signature as proof of delivery.
Delivery may be delayed due to circumstances outside of our control. If this occurs, we will notify you as soon as possible and take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We shall have no liability for delays.
In the event of a failed delivery to you, our courier may re-attempt delivery, leave your delivery with a neighbour or in a safe place outside of your home or leave you a card or contact you to re-arrange delivery. In such event, we may charge you for storage costs and further delivery costs. If we are unable to contact you to re-arrange delivery, we may end the Contract.
Risk and Ownership – You will be responsible for the products from the time we deliver the products to you at the stipulated delivery address. You will own a product once we have received payment in full for that product.
Right to Cancel – You have certain rights to cancel your Contract as set out in our Returns Policy. Your rights depend upon what you have bought, the reason for your return and when you decide to end the Contract. If you have taken advantage of any manufacturer’s warranty applicable to the product you have bought you may have rights under that warranty which you should direct to the manufacturer.
Certain orders may constitute improper use of our Site and "Wayfair Rewards". We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any Contract for any reason. Payment will not be taken, or will be refunded, for any refused orders. Your account, including Wayfair Rewards, may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at our sole discretion, if you have breached these Terms of Use and Sale or any other policy or terms of use relating to the Site or if you have otherwise misused the Site. Verification of certain information may be required prior to the acceptance of any order. An order may not be accepted if such information is not forthcoming from you following such a request.
Warranties and Disclaimers: Sale of Goods
We are under a legal duty to supply products that are in conformity with the Contract and, where you buy as a consumer, you have certain rights, including legal rights relating to faulty or misdescribed goods which apply in addition to our Returns Policy.
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, we disclaim any and all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, in relation to the products. This does not affect your legal rights where you buy as a consumer, nor does it affect your rights to cancel any Contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.
Limitation of Liability: Sale of Goods
We are only responsible for losses that are a natural, foreseeable consequence of our breach of these Terms of Sale. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, OR SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY CONTRACT FORMED UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE AND SALE:
WHERE YOU ARE A BUSINESS, TO ANY BUSINESS FOR ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, GOODWILL OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, OR ANY INJURY TO BUSINESS REPUTATION; OR
ANY LOSSES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE BY BOTH OF US AT THE TIME OF THE CONTRACT.
WHERE YOU BUY AS A CONSUMER, THESE TERMS OF USE AND SALE AND OUR RETURNS POLICY WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER LAW WHICH CANNOT BE OTHERWISE EXCLUDED. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT YOUR LOCAL CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAU.
NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SALE SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, FOR FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR FOR BREACH OF YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THE PRODUCTS.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding paragraph shall apply to all products or services you buy from us through the Site or other channels.
Disputes: Sale of Goods
If you have any issue regarding a product or service you have bought from us, you can seek to settle the dispute out-of-court through an Alternative Dispute Resolution or Online Dispute Resolution (ADR / ODR) procedure. These procedures are an alternative to resolving disputes by arbitration or before a court and as such they are called Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). When they are carried out online, they are called Online Dispute Resolution (ODR).
Resolving disputes through ADR/ODR, in general, is easier, faster and less expensive than resolving disputes before a court. Under the EU-wide ODR Regulation, the European Commission has established a European Online Dispute Resolution platform (ODR platform). The ODR platform is a web-based platform that is specifically designed to help consumers who have bought goods or services online and subsequently have a problem with that online purchase. It allows you to submit your contractual dispute and conduct the ADR procedure online and in any of the 23 official languages of the European Union.
The ODR platform is accessible here: https://ec.europa.eu/odr.
