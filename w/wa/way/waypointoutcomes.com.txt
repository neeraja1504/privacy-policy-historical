- Bridgepoint Education Privacy Policy Bridgepoint Education
APPLICATION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Bridgepoint Education Site. This Site includes links to the websites for Ashford University which has its own privacy policies. To see the privacy policy for Ashford University, click here.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected at any site that is not owned by Bridgepoint Education, including any third-party website reached through a link on this Site. Third-party websites are generally those that have a URL—that is, a web address—that does not contain “bridgepointeducation.com.” For example, there are links on this Site to Bridgepoint Education’s pages on other third-party websites. The name and logo of Bridgepoint Education may appear on third-party sites in order to notify visitors that the sites contain information or materials related to Bridgepoint Education, but this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through third-party sites. You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of third-party websites you access through the Bridgepoint Education Site. We have no control over, and we assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party website. By using the Site, you release Bridgepoint Education from any claim or liability arising from your use of any third party website.
We may use third parties, including third party websites, to perform functions on our behalf, which may include assisting us in gathering and processing information you provide. We share personally identifiable information with them so that they can assist us in using it for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Bridgepoint Education does not otherwise share the personally identifiable information you provide with third parties, and we do not share that information with any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND HOW IS IT USED?
Practices regarding cookies and other information we collect on this site:
Your browser software has a feature called a 'cookie' that stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to certain websites. As a user of browser software, you may elect to disable this feature, although doing so may prevent you from using certain components of the Site that require cookies. Cookies placed on your computer by Bridgepoint Education generally don't provide Bridgepoint Education with any personally identifiable information about you, but instead provide anonymous information that permits Bridgepoint Education to track how users navigate our pages, when users return to our sites, and which features are the most popular. We collect that information using cookies, and we use it to analyze how our Site is used. We may share that information with other persons or entities who assist us in analyzing or operating the Site.
Like many commercial websites, Bridgepoint Education servers monitor and log all web traffic on the Site. These logs contain the IP address of the computer or server that you are using to access the Site, the IP address and/or the URL from the website you visited just before you visited our Site, the URL of the page you visit upon leaving the Site, if any, and the type of browser and operating system you are using. Statistical information is collected about visitor traffic patterns in order to improve the quality, functionality and usefulness of the Site to our customers. This information does not directly identify you. We may also aggregate data from multiple records containing personally identifiable records in a manner that is no longer identifiable with a particular person (for example, the aggregate number of inquiries from a particular city, state or zip code). We may share all of the data described above with our contractors and consultants, other educational institutions, and unaffiliated third parties such as analysts, reporters, governmental authorities, and others. We may also disclose the content of the logs described above in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process.
Please be aware that while some browsers allow you to send a signal indicating that you do not wish to be "tracked", our Site does not recognize or respond to these “Do Not Track” signals.
Use of flash cookies, third-party cookies  and HTML5:
Our Site may enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies,” also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects.” Adobe provides a short disclosure about flash cookies in its End User License Agreement, stating “Use of the web players, specifically the Flash Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a local shared object on our computer. These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to configure certain settings within the Flash Player.” The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage in a manner similar to the browser cookies referenced above. However, flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. You can control the acceptance of flash cookies using tools in the settings manager for Adobe Flash (http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). (Users running the Windows operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player. Users running the Apple operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies, or LSO files are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension.) If you do not allow flash cookies on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of certain components of the Site.
HTML is the software language used for building most of the sites on the World Wide Web. Almost all web pages you visit on the Internet are built using HTML code. HTML5 is simply the fifth and latest iteration of this language. HTML5 is a popular standard for presenting content, especially content delivered to mobile devices. Some HTML5 code may allow your responses to advertising and your other online activities to be monitored over time and across different web sites, and for such information to be stored on your computer or mobile device and accessed by others you do or have done business with. Solutions that allow users to opt-out of or block this sort of tracking are being developed through browser add-ons and other tools. Bridgepoint Education may access user activity information stored through this feature of HTML5.
Additionally, like many other companies, Bridgepoint Education may use third parties to help monitor user visits to this Site and/or to place advertisements or links on other websites. When you visit this Site, these companies may collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., your IP address, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) about your visits to this Site and your visits to other websites over time. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information about your online activities over time and across different web sites, and may use this information to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising by certain participating advertising networks, you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org. Bridgepoint Education is not responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third-party websites.
