Contacting us to exercise your rights and with any questions
If you need help or wish to exercise any of the above rights or have questions about them, please email us by clicking here, or write to us at Geocaching HQ, 837 N. 34 th Street, Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98103. For specific requests to remove or change your profile information on Shop Geocaching (shop.geocaching.com), please email Shop Geocaching directly via https://shop.geocaching.com/default/contact.
We will consider all such requests and provide our response as soon as we can. Please note, however, that some personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your personal information for our legitimate interests, to protect the privacy of others, or to comply with a legal obligation. Please note that we may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.
How long do we keep your personal information?
If you want to permanently delete your account or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your personal information for longer.
If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. As an example, if you temporarily disable your account without removing or adopting out your geocaches, we will keep your information until it is clear that your geocaches are no longer available to be found. Your geocache and trackable logs and any images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which they are associated unless you delete them or explicitly request the permanent deletion of your account. If you have provided personal information or content which other users need to use in relation to the Services (for example information about a particular geocache you have logged, or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals about a particular trackable) we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the Services to our other users but we will delete the information or help you to delete the information upon your request. For more information about trackables please click here.
We know that sometimes users take a break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We will contact you if you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently delete your information. Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted we cannot get it back. If you don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, we will keep it until you want to reactivate your account and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. For example, if you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for as long as necessary to administer the competition.
We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new Services. You will always have the choice of opting out of receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can but within 10 business days.
If you have posted content online in the Geocaching Forums, we will retain that content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.
Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our apps or website (e.g. analytics), we will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose for which it was originally collected. As an example, we may conduct a test for two months during which one group of users is shown our current home page and one group is shown a new version of our home page to determine which is preferable to users. Twenty-four months after completion of the two-month test, we would delete personal information associated with the test.
How do we protect your personal information?
Groundspeak has implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We also work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of third party payment processors using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. However, keep in mind that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Transfers of your personal information outside the European economic area
If you are accessing our Services from Europe, then the Personal information which you provide to us, or which we collect about you, will in most cases be stored and processed in the U.S.
In order to ensure your personal information is protected we have signed up to the EU-US "privacy shield" framework. Please click here to see our Privacy Shield Policy, which will apply to all personal information transferred to the U.S. Please click here to find our more information about the privacy shield framework.
Do I have to be a certain age to use the services?
Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we learn that personal information of someone less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an account then you may alert us via email and request that we delete that child's personal information.
Complaints and questions
If you have any complaints or questions about how we use your personal information, you may contact us using the contact details set out above. We will then get in touch with you to see how we can help.

Privacy Shield Policy
This Privacy Shield Policy (“Policy”) applies to all personal data transferred to Groundspeak, Inc. (“Groundspeak”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) from an organization in the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This Policy sets out our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that personal data. Our general Privacy Policy applies to information that individuals give us about themselves through our websites, applications and services.
Definitions
For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:
“Agent” means any third party that collects or uses personal data under the instructions of, and solely for, Groundspeak or to which Groundspeak discloses personal data for use on Groundspeak’s behalf.
"Groundspeak" means Groundspeak, Inc., which does business as Geocaching and Geocaching HQ, and any predecessors and successors in the United States.
"Personal data" means any data or set of data that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Groundspeak to identify (together with other data) a living individual. Personal data does not include data that is anonymized or aggregated.
"Sensitive data" means any personal data that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data that concerns health or sex life, or data about criminal or administrative proceedings and sanctions.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Groundspeak complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S., respectively. Groundspeak has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“the Privacy Shield Principles”) which are the basis for the principles of this Policy. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Principles
Notice
Groundspeak receives personal data about individuals in the EEA collected by Groundspeak and partners who promote geocaching and/or use geocaching to promote their products or locations in Europe. Groundspeak uses this personal data to provide services enabling individuals to participate in location-based play and customer support, information updates and purchases related to such services and in geocaching-related promotions. This data also facilitates our partners’ participation in geocaching-related marketing and promotions and enables partners to develop other geocaching services.
Choice
Groundspeak will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their data is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal data by contacting us at the address given below.
Groundspeak will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by the individual, without first receiving the individual’s affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). Groundspeak will treat as sensitive any personal data received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
Groundspeak may employ third parties to manage its IT infrastructure, provide credit card processing and customer support, perform analytics, and manage its email service. These entities may have access to personal information if needed to perform their functions for Groundspeak.
Groundspeak may also disclose personal data – such as public profile information and geocache logs – to non-agent third parties by licensing its application program interface (API) to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services. If you wish to opt-out of transfers to such non-agent third parties, please contact us at the address given below or change your authorizations in Account Settings to stop such sharing of data.
Groundspeak may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
For data received under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Groundspeak will obtain appropriate assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal data consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield, its own EU-U.S Privacy Shield certification, or another European Commission adequacy finding.
Groundspeak’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Groundspeak remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Groundspeak proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Security
Groundspeak will take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect personal data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Groundspeak will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.
Access
Upon request, Groundspeak will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request access to their data, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their personal data by contacting us at the address given below or by making changes to their Account Settings.
Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
In compliance with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield, Groundspeak commits to resolve complaints about privacy and personal data collection or use. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact Groundspeak at the address given below. Groundspeak will investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints by reference to the principles contained in this Policy.
Groundspeak has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD web site at www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
