What information do you collect about me?
WAGBRAG collects personal identifying information (“PII”) from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us on website(s) and through e-mail. We also collect PII during transactions, sponsored events, mobile marketing campaigns, and contests/sweepstakes. When visiting one of our online sites, we collect user-specific information on what pages are visited and volunteered information such as survey information and/or site registrations. PII includes your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone and cell phone numbers, wireless service provider, and all other information you provide to us.
We may collect information about your interaction with WAGBRAG sites and services. For example, we may use Web site analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below) to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we may collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.
When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from WAGBRAG, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with WAGBRAG, information collected through one WAGBRAG site or service may be combined with information obtained through other WAGBRAG sites or services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies.

From time to time, we make your PII available to other reputable businesses whose products or services might be of value to you. If you do not want us to share your PII with other companies or organizations, please let us know by emailing us at here .
Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes
WAGBRAG LLC may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in WAGBRAG’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information.
You acknowledge that WAGBRAG is located in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.
Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees
From time to time, WAGBRAG may deploy mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider’s pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.
Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to WAGBRAG or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, WAGBRAG and the third-party campaign operator collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.
What are “cookies” and what do they do for me?
In order to provide better service when you return to our site, WAGBRAG may use cookies to store your preferences and information about such things as items added to your shopping cart, purchases you have made with us, what pages you visit, and past activity at a site. “Cookies” are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that you are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and to customize Webpage content based on your browser type (Netscape or Microsoft Explorer, for example). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allows you to turn off cookies. Please remember, however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when users visit our site.

Use of Web Beacons

Links
WAGBRAG sites may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as WAGBRAG has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.

These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. WAGBRAG has no control over the third-party sponsor’s use of this information. The WAGBRAG site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information.
