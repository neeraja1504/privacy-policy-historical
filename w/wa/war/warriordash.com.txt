OUR PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to a website, domain or mobile application owned by Red Frog Events, its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, “RFE,” “we,” and/or “us”) that features RFE or one of our events or services. This Privacy Policy applies to our websites, domains, mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). RFE makes the Services available for your use subject to all applicable terms and conditions contained in in our Terms of Service and in this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”). The Terms may change from time to time and changes are effective upon posting, so it is your responsibility to check back and review the Terms.
Please read the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Services, including, without limitation, visiting our websites, registering for our events, signing up for contests or sweepstakes, participating in surveys, submitting comments or content, you expressly acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by the Terms and any applicable local laws. You waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of the Terms and the lack of signature by the parties. If you do not agree to the Terms, please stop using the Services immediately.
This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use the information, how we share the information, and the choices you may have with respect to the information we collect.

You also may give us permission to access your information on third party social media sites. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to our websites, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to keep those updated with your preferred settings.
The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, phone number, zip code, billing address, and any other information you choose to provide.
