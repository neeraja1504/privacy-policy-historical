We use this SSL technology to prevent your information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet and is the current standard for credit card security on the Internet today.
Further, you access your Warmoth account information through double verification of your email address and password. When a new Warmoth.com account is created, we require you to submit an e-mail address that is not associated with an existing Warmoth account. We do not allow any e-mail address to access more than one Warmoth.com account, and only you know your password. You can change this email address or password at anytime, once you are successfully logged in.
