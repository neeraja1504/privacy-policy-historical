How We Use Your Personal Information
The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide the War is Boring Features to you, depending on the War is Boring Features for which you register. This includes alerting you of new services, features, or enhancements to the War is Boring Features; verifying your identity; handling your customer service questions or issues; requesting feedback; distributing newsletters; and notifying you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.
