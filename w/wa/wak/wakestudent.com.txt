Privacy Policy | About Wake Forest | Wake Forest University
This policy discloses the privacy practices applicable to visitors to wfu.edu, the website for Wake Forest University. As used in this policy, the terms “Wake Forest, “the University,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Wake Forest University, a North Carolina nonprofit corporation. “You” and “your” refer to the individual accessing the web pages owned and controlled by the University.
You may also find within the Wake Forest domain — signified by the address “wfu.edu” or within the range of domains assigned to the Wake Forest — websites over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control. Such sites include but are not limited to the Web pages of individual faculty members, staff members or students and the Web pages of student organizations and other organizations not formally a part of the University. Although the University encourages compliance with all University policies and practices at such websites, the University serves only as a neutral provider of Internet-related services to them. The University recommends that you seek information from the persons responsible for those sites directly to ensure that you know under what policies and practices they operate. Information gathered by these sites could be both automatic (upon access of the website) or voluntary (provided by the user).
Where is information gathered about you?
We automatically collect information from you when you access wfu.edu (see subsection “Device information collected by us”), as well as when you use the following services:
Go Links (i.e. short URLs)
Add This (i.e. social link sharing)
Email newsletters
Broken-link submissions
Your information is also collected on an opt-in basis when you submit information using web forms, or by making a payment or gift to the University.
What do we use your information for?
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the Wake Forest network. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous.
We may use an email address you provide to send you information or respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
We will not sell your information to third-parties, but may provide it to certain entities in circumstances in which we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate, such as to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.
Device information collected by us
We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access wfu.edu, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to wfu.edu. We will not disclose site usage by individual IP addresses unless compelled to do so by law. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis and then deleted from our systems.

Google: Analytics, Webmaster Tools, Site Search
