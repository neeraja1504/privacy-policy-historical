2.1 The information you provide us
When you use our Services, personal data may be requested.
The expression "personal data" denotes any and all information directly or indirectly identifying you, by reference to an identification number or to one or more elements specific to you.

We record your purchase history on our Websites: date, amount, article(s) bought, means of payment used.

When you use the Services, We collect information on the Services you use and how you use them:
2.2.1 When you surf our Websites, We collect the following information: IP address, connection date and time, interventions on Websites and discussion forums, interactions with the Websites (pages visited, etc.), and preferences (languages). We use cookies or other similar technologies to collect some of this data. Please see Article 5 for more information on cookies.
2.2.2 When you install and use our Games, We collect the following information: game data (data exchange log and history, connection log and history, and generally speaking all data connected to actions performed in the Games), data on your hardware and software configuration (when installing a game and in the event of a modification to your computer's hardware), and IP address.

2.3 When you decide to log in to our Services using a social media account or game platform
The Company may offer you the possibility of logging in to certain Services using a social media or game platform identifier. This connection method will sometimes be required to access certain features of the Services, particularly to offer you the possibility of interacting with other users of these networks and platforms.
When logging in using social media or a game platform, you will be asked to agree that certain information about you be shared with Ankama. By agreeing to this information being shared, Ankama shall have access to this data and will retain some of it.
Thus, by connecting to some of our Applications via the social network Facebook, Ankama will have access to your friends list, but will not retain it. This access allows us to let you use some of the social network's features that involve other users. We keep your Facebook identifier so we can recognize you on several mobile devices and to re-attribute your progress acquired during your prior logins.
When you authorize our Services to interact with social media or game platforms, we may share data concerning you with your contacts. This data includes your name, profile photo on the social media concerned, and your progress and/or ranking in our games.
These social media and game platforms are created and managed by third parties, and are not controlled by Us. We invite you to refer to their terms of use and their privacy policies to understand how these third parties process your data and what data they may communicate to us.
Article no. 3 : Purpose and Legal Basis

Article no. 4 : Disclosure of Personal Data
Ankama may have recourse to third-party service providers who collect your personal data in Ankama's name and on behalf of Ankama, or with whom Ankama will share your data, in a secure manner, notably with the aim of ensuring the completion of the tasks necessary to execute your order, deliver products, process your payments, ensure management of customer relations, provide a chat messaging service, fight payment fraud, provide advertising services, send you text messages (notably to recover your login information), or even propose surveys.
These providers may be located outside the European Union, in particular in the Asia-Pacific region, and in North and South America. Ankama has taken every necessary precaution to ensure that your personal data are sufficiently protected, either under contractual data protection clauses established by the European Commission or by ensuring that these data transfers happen with American companies that adhere to Privacy Shield principles.

5.2.3 Cookies for advertising and to track traffic: These cookies allow us to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our Websites (number of views, number of clicks, etc.) and help Us tailor advertisements promoting our Services displayed on third-party websites (targeted advertising). Additionally, for statistical purposes, We use an analysis and utilization tool for events occurring after e-mails are sent, such as messages being opened, clicks, and the termination of subscriptions or registrations. This tool operates using cookies.
For this purpose, the Company uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (" Google "). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files stored on your computer that make it possible to analyze your use of the website.

Cookie management tools available through your browser will not delete Flash cookies.

to track subsequent browsing from your terminal on our Websites.

You may set your preferences either overall for the Websites, or service by service.
Article no. 6 : Discussion Spaces and User Profiles
The Services may contain discussion spaces, particularly in the form of forums or chat rooms. You may also personalize your user profile.
