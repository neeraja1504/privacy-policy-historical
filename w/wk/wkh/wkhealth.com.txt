Some areas of this site may require you to submit information, to benefit from the specified features (such as e-mail alerts or newsletter subscriptions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what for.

It enables Wolters Kluwer to see how our users move between devices when accessing the Wolters Kluwer web site and Facebook, to ensure that Wolters Kluwer’s Facebook advertising is seen by our users most likely to be interested in such advertising by analysing which content a user has viewed and interacted with on the Wolters Kluwer web site.

LinkedIn Insight Tag | The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we have added to our websites to enable in-depth campaign reporting and to help us unlock valuable insights about our website visitors. We use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our LinkedIn adverts.
The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of metadata such as IP address information, timestamp, and events such as page views. All data is encrypted. The LinkedIn browser cookie is stored until you manually delete it or when the cookie expires (there’s a rolling six-month expiration from the last time the visitor’s browser loaded the Insight Tag).
