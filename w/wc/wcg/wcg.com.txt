Legal bases for processing your information
For users located in the EU only, the GDPR requires us to inform you of the different legal bases that we rely on to legitimize our processing of your personal data. We have described these below.
+ Where using your data is in our legitimate interests
We are allowed to use your personal data where it is in our interests to do so, and those interests aren't outweighed by any potential prejudice to you.
We believe that our use of your personal data is within a number of our legitimate interests, including but not limited to:
To organise, provide and manage the WCG Events and associated services;
To manage our users;
To provide customer support to our users;
For business optimization and service development;
To manage our Websites;
For marketing and promotion services;
To ensure that our systems run smoothly; and
To protect against improper use or unauthorized use of our systems and services.
We don't think that any of the activities set out in this privacy policy will prejudice you in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. We have set out details regarding how you can go about doing this in the section on your rights above.
+ Where you give us your consent to use your personal data
We are allowed to use your personal data where you have specifically consented. In order for your consent to be valid: :
It has to be given freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;
You have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;
You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid "bundling" consents together so that you don't know exactly what you're agreeing to; and
You need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – for example, we could provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.
We currently seek your consent for marketing and advertisement purposes, as well as consent to process your dietary requirements (where applicable).
Before giving your consent you should make sure that you read any accompanying information provided by us so that you understand exactly what you are consenting to.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and details can be found in the "Right to withdraw consent" paragraph in the section on your rights above.
+ Where using your personal data is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under our contract with you
We are allowed to use your personal data when it is necessary to do so for the performance of a contract that we have with you. For example, if you have won a competition, we need to process your bank account information in order to be able to pay you your prize money. In addition, if we need to apply for a visa on your behalf, we need to process certain personal data in order to do so.
+ Where processing is necessary for us to carry out our legal obligations.
As well as our obligations to you under any contract, we also have other legal obligations that we need to comply with and we are allowed to use your personal data when we need to in order to comply with those other legal obligations.
If you are in the EU, we rely on certain lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you.
