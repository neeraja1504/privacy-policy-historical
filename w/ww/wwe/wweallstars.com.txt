3. What types of information does THQ collect?
In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, THQ may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any one of the following features or services.
Website and game-specific registration
Newsletter subscription
General support
Product support
Online store
Contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions
Polls, surveys, or questionnaires
Message boards
Community websites and features
Other features such as e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend*
The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity. The requested personal information may include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, Xbox Live Gamertag and/or PlayStation Network ID and (for those purchasing products online) credit card information including billing and shipping addresses. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide you according to your interests and preferences. Please note, when demographic information, or any other non-personal information, is combined with personal information, we shall treat all of the information, collectively, as personal information. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below.
Any email addresses collected from you during the use of the "Send to a Friend" or "Tell-A-Friend" feature on any THQ Website are not retained by THQ, and are only used to send a one-time email notification on your behalf.
No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

4. How does THQ use the information it collects?
Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information collected from those who register on our Websites is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter or access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions). And, of course, any credit card information is solely used to fulfill and process purchase orders. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, THQ will use your information to provide them to you.
We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our Websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.
We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.
Please be advised that in some areas of our Websites, you may be able to submit information about yourself in a business capacity. Although we can assure you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. These areas typically include an employment section where you can submit your resume online and/or an investors relations section where you can fill out an online form to request financial information about THQ.

5. What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to THQ?

To simply browse our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.

We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.

From time to time, we may run contests, tournaments, or other events or activities ("Events") on our Websites.

13. Kids' Privacy Policy
Building on our general Privacy Policy, THQ recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protections when children under the age of 13 visit the PlayTHQ Websites. Our Kids’ Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use personal information collected online from children. It also describes how parents can review the personal information that we have collected
For your convenience, the Kids’ Privacy Policy uses terms that are defined in our general Privacy Policy, shown above. A link to our privacy policies is also posted at the bottom of each THQ and PlayTHQ Website.
Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Information
We allow children to surf the PlayTHQ Websites, look at content, and play some games without giving us any personally identifiable information. We do not collect personal information from children unless they register on one of the PlayTHQ Websites for access to exclusive content and to receive newsletters regarding upcoming PlayTHQ videogame releases.
During registration for the PlayTHQ Websites, THQ requests and collects from children their e-mail address and birth date, a parent's e-mail address, and a member/user name. Birth dates are collected to validate the ages of our users, including children, and we collect a parent’s e-mail address to let parents know that their child has signed up with the PlayTHQ Websites, to verify their consent and send future notices about their child’s account. We also collect the child’s e-mail address for the purpose of sending the child e-mail related to their subscription to the PlayTHQ Websites and newsletters as mentioned above. We ask that parents set their child’s password, so that the parent has access to their child’s account and personally identifiable information at all times. This password can easily be retrieved or modified by a parent at any time using instructions provided below.
Please note that any sites directed at children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in an online activity on the child's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.
THQ does not sell, market, trade, or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information to third parties outside of our company. We will not use any of the information we collect from any registrant of the PlayTHQ Websites for any purpose other than to access the website, e-mailings as described above and for the purposes of contacting the parent. Situations in which we may share a child's personal information with third parties would include those in which it is reasonably necessary to: protect the security of integrity of the PlayTHQ Websites; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies, or for an investigation related to public safety.
For additional information about how THQ safeguards the personal information of its members please see our general Privacy Policy above.
Electronic Postcards
All electronic postcards accessible on the PlayTHQ Websites request that users furnish an e-mail address. This is necessary to send the postcards electronically. The e-mail addresses are deleted from our servers and not distributed to third parties or used for any other purposes than sending the postcards.
Technical Methods
If a parent allows their child to register with the PlayTHQ Websites and for us to collect personal information about their child, we may link certain Technical Methods to that personal information. These Technical Methods allow us to operate the PlayTHQ Websites more effectively, make them more interesting and useful to you and are beneficial for various purposes related to our business. We do not however collect any additional personally identifiable information via these Technical Methods. For further information about the particular Technical Methods used on the PlayTHQ Websites, please see our general Privacy Policy under the sub-heading: "Does THQ use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?"
Sweepstakes and Contests
We send parents an e-mail when their child registers to enter a sweepstakes or contest on one of the PlayTHQ Websites. We provide parents 48 hours to confirm their child's registration and entry in the sweepstakes or contest. If a parent does not confirm their child’s registration request in this timeframe, we assume it is not acceptable for the child to enter the sweepstakes or contest, and we will delete their child’s information from our database of entries. Once a parent permits a child to register, the child will be allowed to complete their entry into the sweepstakes or contest. Only enough information as is required to enroll in the sweepstakes or contest will be collected. After the drawing or contest is concluded, we will not retain any additional personally identifiable information collected beyond the information already provided at the time of registration for the PlayTHQ Websites. If a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address provided to us during the registration process and request that the parent provide their postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, first initial of last name, city, and state of residence on the PlayTHQ Websites.
Parental Consent
We require that parents give us express permission for their child to register with the PlayTHQ Websites. Additionally, at any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our database. The parent will need to have their child's member name and password. If the password has been lost or forgotten, there are instructions on the PlayTHQ Account Maintenance for Parents page explaining how to recover or set a new password for access. There are three methods for a parent to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children:
Using the e-mail first sent to them by THQ, a parent can click on the link provided to take them to the PlayTHQ Account Maintenance for Parents page. Once linked to this page a parent will be able to log in to their child’s account, review, change or delete any of their child’s personal information, as well as update their child’s password.
A parent can access their child's account information using the following link: http://www.playthq.com/myplaythq/parental_maintenance.php, which will direct them to the PlayTHQ Account Maintenance for Parents page. Once linked to this page, a parent can log in to their child’s account, review, change or delete any of their child’s personal information, as well as update their child’s password.
A parent can also visit www.PlayTHQ.com. By clicking the link at the top of the home page entitled "For Parents" they will be provided with informative text. A link to the PlayTHQ Account Maintenance for Parents page is provided under the subheading "How can I review, modify or delete my child’s PlayTHQ registration information?" By following the link, a parent will be able to use their child’s information to review, change or delete any of their child’s personal information as well as update their child’s password.
Links to Other Sites
When children click on links from the PlayTHQ Websites to other sites, we may open the other sites in a new browser window. We make every effort to only link the PlayTHQ Websites to appropriate outside sites for children, and will advise a user when leaving the PlayTHQ Websites. Unlike the PlayTHQ Websites, however, these outside sites may collect personal information, which is outside of the control of THQ.
Amendments to this Policy
We may amend our Kids' Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail in the event of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child’s personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should keep their personal information updated and provide us with current e-mail addresses. THQ will only apply material changes to the Kids' Privacy Policy in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act that require parental consent.
