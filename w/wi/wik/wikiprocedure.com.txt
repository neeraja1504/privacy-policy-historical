Wikiprocedure:Privacy policy - Wikiprocedure
This is a initial version of Privacy policy which will be followed and developed.
General Scope
This policy covers personally identifiable information collected or stored by Wikiprocedure.
The public and collaborative nature of the projects
Wikiprocedure is collaboratively developed by its users using the MediaWiki software. Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the publicly editable pages of these sites with or without logging in as a registered user. By doing this, editors create a published document, and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed. This is a public act, and editors are identified publicly as the author of such changes. All contributions made to Wikiprocedure, and all publicly available information about those contributions, are irrevocably licensed and may be freely copied, quoted, reused and adapted by third parties.
Wikiprocedre does not require editors to register with us. Anyone can edit without logging in with a username, in which case they will be identified by network IP address. Users that do register are identified by their chosen username. Users select a password, which is confidential and used to verify the integrity of their account. Except insofar as it may be required by law, no person should disclose, or knowingly expose, either user passwords and/or cookies generated to identify a user. Once created, user accounts will not be removed.
General expectations
IP and other technical information
When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to Wikiprocedure, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. Wikiprocedure may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users. When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information for a limited period of time. This information is automatically deleted after a set period. For editors who do not log in, the IP address used is publicly and permanently credited as the author of the edit. It may be possible for a third party to identify the author from this IP address in conjunction with other information available. Logging in with a registered username allows for better preservation of privacy.
Cookies
The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever Wikiprocedure is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit to Wikiprocedure. Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use.
Page history
Edits or other contributions to Wikiprocedure on its procedures, user pages and talk pages are generally retained forever. Removing text from a procedure does not permanently delete it. Normally, in Wikiprocedure, anyone can look at a previous version of an procedure and see what was there. Even if an procedure is "deleted", a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was removed from public view.
User contribution
User contributions are also aggregated and publicly available. User contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.
Reading procedures
No more information on users and other visitors reading pages is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside from the above raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor's identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly.
Editing procedures
Edits to Wikiprocedure pages are identified with the username or network IP address of the editor, and editing history is aggregated by author in a contribution list. Such information will be available permanently on the procedure history.
Logged in registered users:
Logged in users do not expose their IP address to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a Wikiprocedure page by the user or by another user with the same IP address.
Unlogged-in registered users and unregistered users:
Editors who have not logged in may be identified by network IP address. Depending on one's connection, this IP address may be traceable to a large Internet service provider or more specifically to a school, place of business or home. It may be possible to use this information in combination with other information, including editing style and preferences, to identify an author completely.
Disclaimer
Wikiprocedure believes that maintaining and preserving the privacy of user data is an important value. This Privacy Policy, together with other policies, resolutions, and actions by Wikiprocedure, represents a committed effort to safeguard the security of the limited user information that is collected and retained on our servers. Nevertheless, Wikiprocedure cannot guarantee that user information will remain private. We acknowledge that, in spite of our committed effort to protect private user information, determined individuals may still develop data-mining and other methods to uncover such information and disclose it. For this reason, Wikiprocedure can make no guarantee against unauthorized access to information provided in the course of participating in Wikiprocedure.
