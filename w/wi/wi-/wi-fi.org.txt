We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Wi-Fi Alliance uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you.)
