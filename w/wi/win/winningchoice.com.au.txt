About Cohort Digital
Cohort Digital (Cohort Australia Pty Ltd ABN 54 600 161 386) provides permission based marketing services to major high street and online brands. We provide a service designed to deliver sales leads from consumers who have consented to be contacted.
Cohort Digital has wealth of lifestyle and demographic data that we collect directly and openly from consumers. We do this by publishing a variety of online consumer surveys and conducting a range of permission based direct mail and telemarketing activity on a range of different websites. Cohort Digital allows consumers to engage with specific brands or categories of products and services they have indicated they wish to hear from. Cohort Digital provides a range of other services to companies using our database.
One of Cohort Digital’s key business objectives is commitment to open and transparent information practices – informing individuals about how we collect and use personal information and protect the information privacy of those individuals. Personal information is information about an identified individual or one who is reasonably identifiable.
Cohort Digital complies with the Privacy Act 1988 including the Australian Privacy Principles and other Australian regulations such as the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 and the Spam Act 2003, which govern how it must handle personal information (Privacy Act). Our Privacy Policy explains how we do this.
Cohort Digital may change the Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and privacy regulation. Any changes will come into effect when an updated Privacy Policy is posted to our website.
