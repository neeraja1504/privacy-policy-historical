You may also choose to voluntarily add other information to your profile. We will store the information provided on our systems and use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may receive and keep any information you enter on our web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our offerings.
Information about you obtained from third parties : In the course of our business, we may receive and keep information about you that we receive from third parties.

We may consult sources of information related to your credit history or from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to you.
Automatic information : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site. For example, like many web sites, we use "cookies".

We may also allow third parties, such as our advertising partners, to place cookies on your computer. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Do we share what we know about you?
In general, we only share information about you with third parties when we need to in order to transact business with you or on your behalf, when you have requested us or permitted us to, when required by law, when we think it will benefit you (i.e. for your own good), or occasionally, for our own profit. We may also share your personal information with you, when we reasonably believe we are communicating with you.
In the course of running our Games and operating our web site, there are occasions when we may share information about you with other members and players. We will tell you that we may do this when we collect, or you provide us with, specific information such as your screen name and interests.
We send you email and other forms of communication for a variety of reasons, such as to tell you about new games, features, and prizes, to tell you if you have won, to confirm orders and charges, to deliver prizes and gift certificates, and to respond to your customer service requests. Also, we may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses. If you do not want to receive certain email or other communications from us, send an email from the email account that you would like to remove to unsub-int@winster.com with "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the Subject field.
We employ people, consultants, and other companies to perform functions for us. This may from time to time include order fulfillment, prize delivery, sending mail (postal and electronic), analyzing data, marketing consulting, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, and other business functions. These organizations and individuals may have access to your personal information as needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Note specifically that we may share information about you with business partners and vendors from whom we source prizes, including gift certificates, and they may retain this information for their records, add you to their customer records, and treat this information in accordance with their own privacy policies which may differ from ours. we may receive discounts, payments, or other forms of consideration in return for sharing this information with them.
As we grow our business, we may sell or buy other businesses, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the terms of any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, you give us permission to do otherwise). If our business (or substantially all of its assets in one or more transactions) is acquired by or assigned to another party, your personal information may be one of the assets transferred to that party.
We also like to obey the law, so we may release your personal information as appropriate to comply with the law or in response to what we believe to be legitimate requests from law enforcement agencies. If we suspect that you aren't playing fair, have lied to us, are impersonating or pretending to be someone else, are violating the law or our Terms & Conditions of Use, are abusing our web site or are infringing our rights (or those of some third party) in some way, we may disclose your information to others in order to investigate our suspicions or help them to stop you from behaving badly. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction, among other purposes.
Other than the above, we will tell you when we intend to share information about you with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to tell us not to do it.
Special message for California Residents: Effective January 1, 2005, companies that collect personally identifiable information from California residents and disclose such information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with third parties (SB 27). We have elected the second option, and you may request that your information not be shared with third parties by sending or hand delivering your request, including your full name, email address and postal address to: Seaside Entertainment, LLC., | 2110 Artesia Blvd. Suite 101 | Redondo Beach, CA 90278.
What do we do to protect your information?
We are committed to handling your trusted information with high standards of security.
We use scrambling (encryption) methods to protect precious information like credit card numbers. In fact some things (like passwords) are so scrambled that nobody, not even us, can unscramble it.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that protect your information. We restrict access to your information to employees who need to know that information in order to help you.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when appropriate, which scrambles your information like an egg when it is transmitted between your computer and ours.
We maintain information on a computer that is not directly accessible from the internet. Instead, we keep it tucked away discreetly behind our cozy little firewall.
You can help! Anyone who has or gains access to your account will be able to view your personal information, so please be sure that you protect yourself by controlling access to your computer(s), keeping your login and password information confidential, and exercising care when using other people's or public computers. And watch out for those sneaky kids around the house - they know more than you think!
Kids! Gotta love 'em (but not here)!
