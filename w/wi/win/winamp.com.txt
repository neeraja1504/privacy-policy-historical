to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;

We may use your Winamp Information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups of Winamp users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.
If you use Winamp communication tools to disclose information about yourself publicly, other online users may have access to this public information (for example, in chat rooms or online message boards on Winamp websites).
Your Winamp Information and any other information we obtain about you, including the contents of your online communications, may be disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Winamp is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Nullsoft or its affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested.
We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate Winamp Services. If such agents and contractors have access to personally identifiable information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing on our behalf.
Your Choices about Your Winamp Information
We offer you notice and appropriate choices about the use or sharing of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Specifically, you may opt out of certain sharing of information used for advertising purposes. Learn more about your advertising choices here. You may also have the ability to disable specific Winamp features that share information, as described in more detail below.
Privacy Information for Specific Winamp Services
Winamp offers many products and services that collect or use your Winamp Information for personalization or other purposes. All of our Services comply with this Privacy Policy, but some have additional data collection practices that you should know about:
Winamp Player
To enhance your playback experience, the Winamp Player uses technology powered by AMG and/or Gracenote to provide information about the song or other media you are listening to, such as album art, artist biography, discography, and purchase information. If you use the Infoviewer and Now Playing features, information regarding the specific media you are listening to may be collected and stored in a manner that does not identify you personally. Winamp, AMG, and Gracenote may use this information to identify top songs and artists being requested by our users or for other purposes. You have the option to turn this feature off by not accessing the Now Playing view and pressing the "Hide Info" button within the Library views.
The Winamp player automatically gathers certain usage information from you, which may include the length of your session, the number of tracks and streams you've played in a certain session, the number of CDs you've burned, played or ripped, the number of tracks you've transferred to a portable device, the number of playlists you've created, the number of plug-ins you've installed, and the number of skins you've installed. Winamp uses this information to better understand how people use the various parts of our service and to improve the content, features, and functionality of the player. You have choices on whether to share certain usage information with Winamp. The Winamp Preferences screen offers you the ability to opt-in or opt-out of reporting these usage statistics.
Winamp Orgler
The Winamp Orgler is an optional feature that enables you to share your playback information with other Winamp and AOL users. If enabled, the Winamp Orgler collects your playback information, which may include artist, album, title, track number, time zone, location, AOL Screen Name or user name, and other related listening information and posts it online allowing you to see your history and enabling you to share this information with other Orgler and AOL users. This optional feature is turned "off" by default, and your playback information will not be collected or stored unless you decide to enable it.
Gracenote Playlist
The Gracenote Playlist feature builds customized playlists for you by analyzing the music in your library. It works by identifying other tracks that are similar to a song or songs you select. To build custom playlists, the software sends information to Gracenote's databases, including song title, artist name, album name, track number, genre, and song duration. No information that identifies you personally is sent or shared with Gracenote. If you do not wish to share this information, do not use the Gracenote Playlist feature, or you may uninstall the Nullsoft Playlist Generator Plug-in from the Winamp software under the preferences menu.
Gracenote Auto-Tag
The Auto-Tag feature of Winamp, also powered by Gracenote, gives you the option to update information related to the song you are listening to with the information provided from the Gracenote database. If you do not wish to have Gracenote receive this information, do not use the Auto-Tag feature, or you may uninstall the Nullsoft Auto-Tagger Plug-in from the Winamp software under the Preferences menu.
Skins
Winamp offers you the ability to create and post skins for others to review and download. If you decide to create a skin to share with others, Winamp will show your AOL Screen Name or username and provide a link so that others can provide you feedback about the skin.
Winamp also gives you the option to write a review of a skin. The review will appear on the Winamp website with the skin and will contain your AOL Screen Name or username. Winamp automatically keeps track of the number of times a skin has been downloaded.
Some of our advertising partners may create skins that contain web beacons. These web beacons provide the advertiser with information about the use of the skin, such as the number of times a user clicked on the advertiser's logo.
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
Winamp may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies in combination with your Winamp information to enhance and personalize your experience on Winamp, including to operate and improve offerings through Winamp; to help authenticate you; to remember your preferences and registration information; to enable a shopping cart; to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of Winamp offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which Winamp e-mails you open and act upon); and to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through Winamp. You can control cookies through your browser's settings; however, if you reject all cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of certain Winamp offerings.
Winamp and its advertisers may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Winamp Services. These ad network providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of sites to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. Winamp may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you as a user (such as user age and zip code) with certain ad network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Winamp's. You can find out more about ad network providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking here.
Protecting Children
Winamp is intended for a general audience and is not designed for children under age 13.
Security
Winamp has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your Winamp Information, but cannot guarantee that your Winamp Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of Winamp and its affiliated providers). To protect your privacy and security, Winamp uses passwords to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to any of your Winamp Information.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
Winamp may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. If there are significant changes to Winamp's information practices, we will post a notice on our website and provide appropriate choices before using the Winamp Information we have already collected in a new or inconsistent way. You may be provided other privacy-related information in connection with your use of Services from Winamp, as well as for special features and services not described in this Policy that may be introduced in the future.
In the event that ownership of Winamp was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Winamp Information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your Winamp information, Winamp will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
This policy is effective June 30, 2009.
