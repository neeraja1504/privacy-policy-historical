Active Collection of Personal Information. In order that you may access or take advantage of the Sites, we may ask you to provide Personal Information when you register with the Sites and when you communicate or otherwise interact with the Sites. "Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify a specific individual.

Passive Collection of Information; Online Tracking by Third Parties. In addition to the Personal Information that you actively provide to us, we and our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect certain information about your use of the Sites.  This information may include demographic and geographic information; IP address; browser type; and operating system characteristics as well as clickstream data, which is information about the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through our website.  This information may be used, among other things, to help us compile website metrics and analytics, and thereby improve and customize your experiences on the Sites, to target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to the Sites, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share information about visitors to the Sites with third party companies for the same purposes.
