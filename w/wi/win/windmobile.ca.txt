ComplianceFreedom Mobile relies on these ten principles to protect the Personal Information collected from its customers, potential customers and visitors to our website. Freedom Mobile has established this Privacy Policy in accordance with The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”)
This Privacy Policy does not apply to independent retailers of our products and services, except to the extent they provide us with your Personal Information to enable us to deliver services to you.
Personal Information and Collection
In this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual, for example an individual’s name, account number, e-mail address, payment information, user logs or certain numbers associated with that individual’s equipment (for example a wireless phone number) if Freedom Mobile can link such numbers to the individual. It does not include aggregate information that cannot be associated with a specific individual. We only collect Personal Information when you voluntarily submit it to us, when you authorize us to collect it from third parties or when third parties have the right to provide us your Personal Information.
Use of Information
Freedom Mobile and its affiliates may use Personal Information for the following purposes:
• to conduct marketing research;
• to send you marketing and other communications;
• to understand your needs and preferences and your eligibility for our products & services;
• to develop and enhance our products and services;
• to provide you products and services, including sending and receiving confirmations, communications and bills, validating your identity, providing you support,
authorizing and processing payments or performing credit checks;
• to respond to specific requests from you;
• to administer and manage our business and operations, including the protection of the security and integrity of our services and our website; and
• to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected, and will only retain your Personal Information only as long as we require it for such purposes. Our general retention guideline is a 7-year period, which extends to all our corporate records including our customer & billing database. This allows us to meet our financial accountability and SOX audit obligations. Outside of the 7-year period, retention is defined based on length of time information is needed to meet the purpose(s) for which it has been collected and takes into account the sensitivity of the personal information. For example, we keep call records for 2 years, and IP logs for 180 days.
Freedom Wi-Fi
Freedom Mobile will automatically collect certain information such as Device location, Device type, and general usage information associated to the Media Access Control (“MAC”) address associated with your Device (the “Device Information”). The Device Information is used to deliver the Freedom Wi-Fi service, monitor and improve network traffic, improve your Freedom Wi-Fi experience and for research and statistical purposes. In certain instances, Freedom Mobile will rely on a third party to deliver Freedom Wi-Fi services at a specified location (for example, certain airports, universities or other public buildings). The relationship with the third party is governed by strict privacy provisions, in compliance with PIPEDA. As part of the delivery of the Freedom Wi-Fi services, the third party may have access to the Device Information, which can only be used for limited network monitoring and improvement purposes.
