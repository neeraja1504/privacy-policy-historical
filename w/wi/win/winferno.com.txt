Information Collection & Use
Orders
If you purchase a product or service from us, we require certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information such as name, email, and shipping address and financial information such as credit card number, and expiration date.
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders which include downloadable software with links sent to customers by email. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also contact you if we find that you are experiencing problems downloading software you purchase from us.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out."
Communications from the Site
Special Offers and Updates
In order to make sure that our customers have the most complete and up to date versions of software, we will occasionally send you information on software upgrades, products, special deals, and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from us on our registration page.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out."
Service-related Announcements
We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. Service related announcements are only sent when there is a problem or potential problem with software you have purchased from us.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. Please see "Choice and Opt-out."
Customer Service
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, or by phone when requested.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)
We collect aggregated demographic information about our user base. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. This aggregate information is collected by the use of third party tracking devices such as cookies.
Personally Identifiable Information
Agents
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. While agents have access to personally identifiable information for the previously mentioned purposes, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
Service Providers
We use other third parties to provide fulfillment services such as CDs from our site. When you sign up for CD delivery, we will share your contact information including, name, email address, shipping address and phone number as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Third parties are occasionally used to complete email campaigns to customers.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
Customer Testimonials
We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer name. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
Legal Disclaimer
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
Automatic McAfee Software Renewal
Customers may purchase McAfee’s automatic renewal service by selecting that option on the checkout page for McAfee products. By purchasing an automatic renewal service through Winferno Software, customers agree to have their billing information and credit card number encrypted and passed along to McAfee. This information will be used by McAfee to charge the customer for another subscription after a year from the date of product registration. It is strongly recommended that customers review McAfee’s privacy policy prior to purchasing the automatic renewal service.
Choice/Opt-out
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference once you receive any promotional communications from us.
If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by contacting us at http://www.winferno.com/re/support.asp.
You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.
Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.
