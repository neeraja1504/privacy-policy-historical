WinsPark - Privacy and Security Policy
As an operator based in the EU, Hermione is GDPR compliant and entirely committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy outlines our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing the Private Information we gather through your use of our services and website, and relays the rights of individuals in relation to the personal data we hold.
The Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service and is incorporated therein by reference. It is likewise an integral part of Winspark User Agreement. Accordingly, when you access or use the Winspark website, you automatically agree to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We collect your information in order to:
Comply with our regulatory duties, obligations and responsibilities.
Conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes under any valid and applicable legislation and/or competent authority (meaning any authority having any governmental, juridical or regulatory jurisdiction over us).
For the purpose of reporting  potential or suspected crime, including money laundering or  fraud.
If you do not agree, or are not comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Winspark website and services.
According to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Winspark commits to taking the following customer’s rights into consideration:
Breach Notification
Where a data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the Company is obliged to inform all customers within 72 hours of first having become aware of such a breach.
Right to Access
Winspark’s clients have the right to know whether or not personal data is being processed, where, and for what purpose. For more detailed information, customers can check the following sections of the privacy Policy (below):

**  - How we use the information we collect
**  - With whom we share the information
**  - Retention of Personal Information**
Upon request, we will provide our customers with a copy of the collected personal data in an electronic format.
**Right to be Forgotten  **
Winspark’s clients have the right to request their personal data to be erased and cease the further dissemination of their data by the Company or any third parties. It should also be taken into consideration that this right requires the Company to compare the individual’s rights to the “public interest in the availability of the data” when regarding such requests.
**Data Portability  **
Winspark’s customers have the right to request their previously provided personal data. Data portability allows customers to use this data with other operators as well.
**The type of information we collect  **
**We collect two types of information from our users:  **
1. Non-personal Information  - the first type of information is unidentified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user, which may be made available or gathered via your use of our services . User’s Non-Personal information includes, Inter alia, IP address, ISP and operating system types, internet browsers and dates, as well as times our service is accessed.

When you use our Services, you will be asked to provide Personal Information.

If we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
