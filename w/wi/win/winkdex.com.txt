How We Use Personal Information We Collect
We may share information with various third-party service providers (including those that may be located outside of the United States or your country), who help us operate our platform and systems in connection with our business. Such third-party service providers are subject to strict confidentiality obligations. In addition, we may be compelled to share information with law enforcement, government officials, and regulators.
Set forth herein is a non-exhaustive list of some examples of how we may use your information:

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send direct marketing materials promoting services, products, facilities or activities to you using information collected from you. An opt-out channel will be provided to enable you to exercise your right to opt out of such direct marketing.

Privacy Statement for Data Subjects Whose Personal Information May Be Collected in or from the EEA
While customers who are located in the EEA are customers of our US entity, we recognize and, to the extent applicable to us, adhere to relevant EEA data protection laws.
Collection and Transfer of Data Outside the EEA
As outlined above, we may collect Personal Information from Data Subjects located in the EEA. To facilitate the services we provide to customers located in the EEA, we request explicit consent for the transfer of Personal Information from the EEA to the US. If you are an individual located in the EEA and you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to receive notifications when our methodology or constituents change.

We process the Personal Information of Data Subjects who are located in the EEA with their explicit consent to provide notifications when our methodology or constituents change. Data Subjects in the EEA may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the lawful basis for processing their Personal Information. Should a Data Subject withdraw consent for processing, a Data Subject may be unable to avail him or herself of the services we provide.
Automated Decision-Making
We do not engage in automated decision-making.
Non-Disclosure of Personal Information
Our employees are prohibited, either during or after their employment, from disclosing Personal Information to any person or entity outside of our company, including family members, except under the circumstances described above.
