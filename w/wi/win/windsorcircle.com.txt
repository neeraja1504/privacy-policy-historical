At Mansell Group D.B.A WhatCounts, Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries, (Collectively, “ WhatCounts ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”), we respect and protect the privacy of our customers (“ you ,” “ Customer ,” or “ your ”), website visitors and, to the extent required under applicable law, certain third parties associated with our customers. This “ Privacy Policy ” describes our practices for how your personal information is collected and used. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit the WhatCounts website (“ Site ”) or use any WhatCounts product or service (“ Services ”), and from other sources.
By visiting the Site or by purchasing or using the Services, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your information as described below. If you are a Customer, this Privacy Policy is made subject to, and is a part of, our standard terms of use or other written agreement between us.
We primarily collect and maintain three categories of information, which categories may include both information that can be used to identify or contact an individual (“personal information”) and other non-personal information:
Customer Information. You may provide, and we may collect, information when you activate, subscribe for or otherwise use the Services (“ Customer Information ”). Examples of Customer Information include your account information such as username and password, billing information, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, usage details of the Service, information related to support or service requests, and current geographic location and language.
Target Data. We collect data stored or uploaded by you into the Services about the behavior and demographics of your customers and other third parties that consent to the receipt of marketing and other content from you, or that otherwise interact electronically with you or your website (“ Target Data ”). All Target Data is controlled by our Customers, who are the data controllers for such information with respect to EU data protection laws and regulations. Each Customer is responsible for obtaining the requisite consent in accordance with applicable law from its customers and third parties for us to collect and use the Target Data as necessary for the provision of the Services. Except as provided herein, we will not process Target Data for other purposes or by other means than as instructed by our Customers.
Usage Information. When you access or use our Services or Site we automatically collect certain information via technologies such as cookies and web beacons (“ Usage Information ”), which may include data about visitors to the Site who may or may not be our customers. Examples of Usage Information include IP addresses or other device addresses or ID, browser and device type, geo-location data, and dates and time of the visit or use of the Services or Site. We may also employ web beacons to collect information regarding your or your customer’s interaction with email messages, such as whether a message is opened or forwarded. More information on how and why we collect Usage Information is in the “Cookies and Web Beacons” section of the Privacy Policy below.
Information from Other Sources. We may obtain Customer Information, including personal information, about you or a prospective customer from our business partners or other third parties, for the purposes of providing you with improved Services.
Although we do not actively collect such information, certain information that is provided to us by our customers may relate to or contain personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or information specifying the sex life of an individual (any such information, “ Sensitive Information ”).
The Site and Services are not intended to be used by children under the age of sixteen (16) for residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and under the age of thirteen (13) for all others, and we do not knowingly collect information from such children. If we become aware that a child under the age of thirteen (13) (or a child from the EEA under the age of sixteen (16)) has provided us with information, we will remove it from our systems. If you believe we might have any information from or about underage children, please contact us at privacy@whatcounts.com.
How We Use Your Information

If you have provided your contact information to us, you agree we may use such information to contact you for marketing purposes via direct mail, email, telephone, pre-recorded messages, text messages, instant messages or other communications methods. If, however, you live in the European Union or another jurisdiction where affirmative and express consent is required, we will obtain such consent before contacting you for marketing purposes. For all of our customers, if at any time you do not want us to use your information in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please opt-out by following the instructions set forth below.

Target Data. WhatCounts may use Target Data in connection with its performance of the Services, and in accordance with the instructions provided by the applicable Customer. We may also use non-personally identifiable Target Data in aggregate and blinded formats that do not identify, reference or imply an association with, Customer or its customers, for the purposes of creating benchmarking, statistical, research and marketing analyses, surveys, reports and studies. If you are a customer of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly.

Disclosure of Your Information
We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy under the following circumstances:
Disclosures With Your Consent. We may disclose your personal information to third parties with your consent, or if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.
Disclosures Required by Law. Under certain circumstances, Customer Information and Target Data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders or we may be required to disclose such information in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of WhatCounts, our customers, or third parties. In such circumstances, you agree WhatCounts may disclose such information to the extent necessary to comply with such legal order or requirement (“ Disclosures Required by Law ”).
Disclosures To Our Affiliates. We may share your information that we collect, or provide to us, with our affiliates. WhatCounts affiliates will use such shared information in a manner consistent with their privacy policies, which shall be no less stringent than this privacy policy.
Disclosures To Our Partners. Where lawful to do so, and subject to your consent where required, we may provide Customer names to certain trusted business partners for marketing purposes, but will never share any Target Data with such business partners.
Disclosures To Service Providers. In addition to Disclosures Required by Law, we may engage subcontractors, service providers and other third parties to help us deliver, maintain, upgrade, create, or improve the Site and/or the Service, and these parties may have access to certain of your information in the course of providing such services. Further, we may share your information with third parties in connection with our analysis of Site usage, as discussed below, under “ Cookies and Web Beacons ”. In the event you do not agree to any such disclosure, you may contact us as discussed below to modify or delete the information we hold. Additionally, aside from in connection with Disclosures Required by Law, any disclosure to a third party of personal information of data subjects within the EEA will only be made if such third party satisfies the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (as defined below), or has entered into a written agreement with us providing that it will provide at least the level of privacy protection as is provided in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
Disclosures Due to Changes of Ownership. We may also provide your Information to a third party in connection with a merger, sale, or acquisition transaction, in which case we will require any such third party to agree to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

As part of the Services, the Site may contain links to websites operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party websites.

Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information to the owner of such third party websites. Please review these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.
From time to time, personal information from data subjects in the EEA that we collect may be transferred or accessed by entities who may be based outside of the EEA. We may also allow our service providers or assistance providers, who may be located outside the EEA, access to your personal data. We may also make other disclosures of your personal data overseas, for example, if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests. For example, transfers to our service providers and other third parties will always be protected by contractual commitments, further assurances where appropriate, such as the European Commission’s approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or certification schemes such as the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred from within the EU to the United States of America.
