About the website:
Wifelovers.com is an online community of adults sharing personal information about their interests in legal sexual activities. This information is in the form of postings on the community bulletin board of personal pictures, discussions, personal ads and erotic stories. These postings reflect the views of the authors and are not the views of Wifelovers or Tarrob Web Services.
This website does not allow community postings of any "sexually explicit conduct" as defined in 18 USC ยง 2256. Simply put, this is a adult website of a soft-core nature.
18 U.S.C. 2257 statement:
In compliance with the Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law (also known as 18 U.S.C. 2257), all models who appear in any visual depiction of "sexually explicit conduct" as defined in 18 USC ยง 2256 were 18 years of age or older during the time of photography. Records required to be maintained by this section are kept by the custodian of records listed below.
All other visual depictions displayed on this website are exempt from the provisions of 18 U.S.C. section 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 because said visual depictions do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C section 2256 (2)(A) to (2)(E), but are merely depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual depictions were created before November 1, 1990, or produced, manufactured, published, duplicated, reproduced or reissued before May 26, 1992.
