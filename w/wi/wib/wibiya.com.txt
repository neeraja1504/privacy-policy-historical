You also may provide us with additional information (such as company name, title etc.) so we can provide you with a more customized experience on the Website and offer you better support.
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys or special promotional or other programs on the Website. If you choose to participate, we may request certain PII from you. Participation in such contests or surveys or programs is voluntary and you have a choice whether to provide this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code), and, in the case of a special program involving a form of payment, payment details. We use this information to notify participants, to monitor Website traffic, customize the Website or send participants email updates.

Choice/Opt–out
You have the option to choose to receive occasional email updates from Wibiya. Such updates can include a newsletter or other notifications in relation with the Website or the Wibiya Platform. We provide you with the opportunity to 'opt–out' of having your PII used for such purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing materials from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. If you no longer wish to receive our email updates, you may opt–out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each update or by emailing us at: support@Wibiya.com.

Wibiya may use third party service providers for the purpose of distributing emails to its registered users and/or toolbar/apps publishers or for providing Wibiya with operational services or data and server maintenance/optimization services. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
Wibiya may use a third party service provider to manage and operate a discussion board or other open forum within the Website for general matters of interest or special program. The use of any "public" area or feature of the Website is subject to the “public" area or feature Terms of Use. Users of the “public" area or feature may choose to place PII on messages they post. If you use a “public" area or feature on this Website, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any PII you submit there may be read, collected, or used by other users of these “public" areas or features, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the PII you choose to submit in these "public" areas or features.
Wibiya may disclose PII to its parent company and any of its subsidiaries. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
Wibiya may engage in business relations with third party companies and offer unique services to clients of such companies within a private label environment. For such purposes, some pages of the Website may be branded with both the Wibiya brand and the third party brand. The third party may not use the private label environment to collect any PII. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the pages in the private label environment.
We use the Crazyegg service to help us understand how people use the Website. To understand Crazyegg’s practices go to the Crazyegg privacy policy at: http://www.crazyegg.com/privacy. Crazyegg, and not Wibiya, is responsible for the Crazyegg privacy policy and any choices set forth in that policy.
If you use any Ads serving services that we provide, some of these services have their own privacy policies that govern the use of their services. Our advertising partners use PII or non-PII to deliver relevant advertising. One of these privacy policies is available at: http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy, and you can opt-out of providing your information to such third party as set forth therein. To help ensure that information is not collected by these entities, you can clear all of your Cookies as provided in your browser's instructions.

If you entered the Website by clicking an affiliated link or promotion on another Website, or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for the Services, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent app you may build using our platform.
Wibiya reserves the right to disclose your PII as required by law and/or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.
Use of Cookies, Server Logs or other Similar Technologies
Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising and other data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Website, the Services and/or other third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other similar information gathering technologies (collectively, "Information Gathering Technologies") to collect non PII automatically as you access and browse the Website and/or use the Services and/or a Publisher website. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Wibiya only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.
If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website and/or the Services, but your ability to use some areas of the Website and/or the Services may be limited.
By visiting the Website and/or using the Services, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to gather information about your use of the Website and/or the services through these Information Gathering Technologies.
Server logs capture certain non–PII, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally but not exclusively used to help plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems.
We may also use the data collected by Information Gathering Technologies, individually and combined with other data, to perform tasks including customizing content, customizing advertising, and other related functions such as measuring the effectiveness of advertising.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us, and we take steps to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can contact us at privacy@Wibiya.com.
