Last Updated: December 21, 2008
SCOPE OF POLICY
At Wii Fit Mommies (”The Cool Mom Guide” or “The Cool Mom Guide to Fitness” or “Wii Fit Mommies” or “we” or “us”) we respect your privacy rights and are committed to protecting the information we collect from you online. To further this commitment, we have developed the following Website Privacy Policy (”Privacy Policy”) which explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information you provide to us on any of the websites covered by this agreement (each “Website” and together the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through a Website we operate or authorize. It does not apply to information we collect offline unless, with your permission, that information is combined with information collected or submitted online. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected on websites operated by our parent, subsidiaries or other third parties. Please note that we are not operated by and are not affiliated with the Nintendo website located at www.Nintendo.com, the Nintendo Wii Fit website at http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/launch or the Nintendo Wii website located at wii.com.
UPDATES TO POLICY
Occasionally, we will revise and update this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to our privacy practices. If we revise this Privacy Policy, the “Last Updated” date above will be changed. If we make a major change to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of the change on all of the Websites.
INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU
In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, we may collect personal and non-personal information about you. Non-personal information includes anonymous information such as demographic data. Under all circumstances, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. Please read below for a description of each type of information collected.
Personal Information is information that can be used to identify you such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address. We do not collect any Personal Information about you unless you choose to provide it to us. If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may be unable to use certain features on our Websites.
Demographic information is anonymous information such as your age, date of birth, gender, hobbies, interests, zip/postal code or country. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires Personal Information, we may combine the demographic information with your Personal Information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your interests and preferences. Demographic information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user. If you choose not to provide certain demographic information, you may not be able to use certain features on our Websites.
Aggregate information is anonymous data about individuals that is grouped together to study a group or category of services or users. Aggregate information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user.
COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We request Personal and demographic information to respond to your requests and provide services to you such as: registering for and participating in the Wii Fit Mommies (”The Cool Mom Guide to Fitness”) ; sending email newsletters; participating in online contests and sweepstakes; and sending email correspondence. Each category below describes how we handle the requested information.

Email Correspondence and Other Communication
We may respond to your email correspondence and communications if such correspondence includes a return email address. Because an email address is Personal Information, we protect the privacy of the sender by limiting access to these email messages. Only administrators with a legitimate business need to access the emails are allowed to do so. For quality control purposes, email messages may be kept for a period of time. There may, however, be certain cases where hard copies may be kept on file, such as emails concerning forum questions or complaints. Information from email messages will not be used for marketing purposes and will be maintained in a secure location.
Online Interaction
Some of our Websites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or newsgroups (”Public Forums”) available to users. Please remember that any information disclosed in Public Forums becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose your Personal Information in these Public Forums. We do not individuals under the age of 18 to participate in Public Forums.
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties. We may share Personal Information with vendors who help us perform various internal functions necessary to operate our business. We may disclose Personal Information (a) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law; (b) if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to any claims; (d) to enforce the terms and conditions of our Websites; or (e) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Wii Fit Mommies (”The Cool Mom Guide to Fitness”), our readers, or the public. We also may disclose your email address to our partners solely to send you email messages you have requested, or to ensure that you do not receive such messages if you have opted out of receiving them. Any vendors or partners with whom we may share Personal Information are permitted to obtain only the Personal Information they need to deliver the services requested. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Cookies may be linked to Personal Information about you. Specifically, we use cookies  to prevent you from having to reenter your registration data (such as user name and password) at each connection. In addition, we may use information collected by cookies, for other purposes, such as helping us determine how to improve our Websites by seeing which areas and features  are most popular; personalizing the Website and making recommendations based on sections you have linked to in the past; and completing transactions you have requested.

NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us.

Personal Information is stored in firewall-protected servers. We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted Personal Information by email or by posting a notice on the affected Website. We also strive to limit access to Personal Information to employees performing a legitimate business function. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. Despite our efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. If you forget your Wii Fit Mommies (”The Cool Mom Guide to Fitness”) password, we will authenticate your identity by sending an email to the address in your account profile.
