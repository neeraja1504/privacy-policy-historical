Willow Garage Privacy Policy | Willow Garage
This Privacy Policy was last updated in November 2008.
Willow Garage, Inc. (“Willow Garage”, “we”, or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting and using the Sites and Services or by registering for the Services and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Willow Garage Terms of Use that you can find at http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/TermsOfUse and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes Willow Garage’s practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that Willow Garage does not own or control or that do not support Willow Garage in providing the Services.
“Personal Information” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
“Anonymous Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.
We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from Users.
BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.
Personal Information We Collect
We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:
• If you register for the Services and create an Account to become a Member, we collect your name, a username, your e-mail address, and a password for your Account.
• When you register for the Services we may also collect additional information on an optional basis, including, but not limited to, the city, state, and country where you live, and the company you work for.

Personal Information Collected Via Technology
As you use the Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to visit the Sites. Willow Garage also stores a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store your login information (if any) and your personal preferences for the Services. Willow Garage may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Services may not function as effectively.
Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Services, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.
Personal Information From Other Sources
We may receive Personal Information about you from outside the Sites, such as telephone, fax, mail, or from third parties that provide services for us that are related to the Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Services.
Use Of Information We Collect

We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of the Services, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.
We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may also create Anonymous Information on how you use the Services. We may use this Anonymous Information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose any Anonymous Information at our discretion.

However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the Services.
Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
