PROTECTION OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We offer secure webpages to collect certain kinds of user information, and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form.
We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system.
While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Sites reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.
Our servers use secure sockets layer (SSL) and encryption technology, with the objective that only we can read a customer's personally identifiable information.
We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personally identifiable information.
LENGTH OF TIME WE KEEP INFORMATION
We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it (for instance, for taxation or insurance purposes or in case orders may give rise to claims).
We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data, if needed, to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it.
In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.
The Sites may contain links to third-party websites.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, even if you access the websites using links from our Sites.
Your use of these third-party websites is entirely at your own risk, and we recommend that you check the Privacy and Security Policy of each website you visit.

We make no representation or warranty as to the effectiveness, quality, legitimacy or data protections of any third-party website.
