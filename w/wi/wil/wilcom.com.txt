This Privacy Policy applies to Wilcom International Pty Limited and all references to " Wilcom ", " we ", " us " or " our " are references to Wilcom International Pty Limited (ACN 119 508 575).
Wilcom is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy sets out how we manage your personal information and other information.  From time to time, we may need to change this Privacy Policy.  If we do so, we will post the updated version on our website (www.wilcom.com/about/PrivacyStatement.aspx) and it will apply to all your information held by us at the time.
When we refer to your information, we are referring to your personal information (as defined under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)) and other information about you.
The kind of information we collect and hold about you
Depending on the particular circumstances, we may collect and hold different information about you.  For example, this may include:
your name, date of birth, occupation, home or work address, telephone and email contact details;
financial information, such as your bank account or credit card details;
your Wilcom security credentials, such as username and passwords;
your website address and domain name;

How we collect your information
We may collect your information in a number of ways, including:

from third parties such as our related companies, business partners, clients and other service providers;

We may also collect information from you online using cookies and other analytical tools or when you visit our websites, including when you use our products and services.
How we hold your information
We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of your information and to protect it from unauthorised disclosure.  When your financial details (such as a credit card number) are transmitted from our website to a third party website, they are protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
However, as the internet is not always secure, we cannot be responsible for the security of information you transmit over the internet or for any unauthorised access or use of that information.
You should also be aware that any personal information you disclose when using our online forums will be available to the public. You should take appropriate care to safeguard your information by not disclosing your security credentials (such as your username and password).
How we use and disclose your information
We may use and disclose your information for a range of different purposes, including:
to provide products and services and information about those products and services to you, to assist you with enquiries, or to improve our customer service;
for our billing and account purposes;
to maintain our business relationships where you are a business partner, a user of our website and services, or a customer;
to our related companies, our business partners, distributors and service providers, and other third parties who assist us in providing services to you and managing our business;
to our professional advisers; and
where required by law.
We may disclose or give access to your information to our related companies and our service providers who are located outside of Australia.  For example, we may disclose your information to our related companies and business partners in the countries listed at http://www.wilcom.com/en-us/contact/wilcomdistributors.aspx.
Marketing
We may also use your information so that we, our related companies, and other business partners and service providers can promote and market products, services and special offers, and advise you of news and industry updates, events, reports and other information that we think will be of interest to you.
