3. Personal data that is processed when you open a Wild Apricot payments account or pay for products or services through our Sites or our customers’ sites: When you pay for products and services through our Sites or our customers’ sites, we collect, but do not store, your payment information, which may include credit card data, debit card data, and Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment data, including bank name, ABA/Routing number, bank account number, account type, and account holder name. When you open a Wild Apricot Payments account, we collect your contact information and organization details, including Federal Tax ID, bank account details, and the SSN and Driver’s License of the organization’s authorized signer or beneficial owner.  If you pay fees to an organization with a Wild Apricot Site or make any purchases from such an organization’s Site, you should review that organization’s privacy policy for information on its privacy practices relating to payment data and other personal data.
Purposes and Legal Grounds:
Payment Processing. When you pay for services via credit card, debit card, check, or ACH payment, Wild Apricot will transfer your payment data ( e.g. ,  payment card data, bank name, ABA/Routing number, bank account number, account type, account holder name) and billing details, including recurring payment schedule if applicable, to third-party electronic payment vendors (also known as payment gateways) that process electronic payment data so that you may pay for such services. For all such payments, Wild Apricot only transfers payment data through protected servers and does not store any payment data. If you authorize recurring payments or non-recurring future payments, your payment data and billing details will be saved by our third-party electronic payment vendors. The legal ground for processing payment data is that such processing in order to effect payment is necessary for the performance of contracts between Wild Apricot and our customers and between our customers and their members and contacts.
Choosing a Payment Processor.  When a Wild Apricot customer applies for Wild Apricot Payments, which is Wild Apricot’s own payment processing system that is powered by AffiniPay, a payment gateway that specializes in payment solutions for associations, we will share a summary of such customer’s transaction history, as well as certain customer personal data ( e.g. , name, SSN number, driver’s license number) with AffiniPay, who may use the information to verify eligibility for payment services, to improve the quality and speed of our services, and, where permissible, to market its payment processor services to our customers.

Your withdrawal of consent will not apply to data that was processed prior to our receipt of your withdrawal of consent. To the extent that you provide your personal data directly to an identified electronic payment vendor, you should review that electronic payment vendor’s privacy policy for information on its privacy practices relating to personal data.
Payment Authentication.  To help reduce the risk of fraud and provide added security to online payments through the adoption of 3D Secure 2.0, the industry standard approach, which also complies with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements in the European Union, Wild Apricot or Wild Apricot’s electronic payment vendors may collect additional personal data to authenticate certain online payments. For example, we may need to collect something you know ( e.g. , password, security question, PIN); something you have ( e.g. , code sent to your mobile phone or hardware token); and/or something that is unique to you ( e.g. , fingerprint, facial recognition). If Wild Apricot collects such personal data from you, we may transfer the data to our third-party electronic payment vendors who may also partner with third-party service providers to process such personal data. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Wild Apricot’s legitimate interest in adopting an industry standard approach to reduce the risk of fraud and protect the security of your payments.
