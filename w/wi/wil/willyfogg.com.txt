How do we use the information we collect?
We use the information we collect from or about you to provide the Services. This means that we process each search query you submit, together with information such as your IP address, to return a search results page to you. We may also share such information with third party content and advertising providers so that certain content and advertising can be included in the search results page we return to you (see "What information do we disclose or make available to third parties?" below). A search results page may include targeted advertisements in the form of sponsored links based on keywords contained within your search query.
After expiry of the relevant data retention period we completely and irreversibly anonymise your Search Data, (see "Is there any other information we might collect in certain circumstances?" above).

How do we, or third parties acting on our behalf, use cookies on the Site?
A cookie is a text file that allows us to store user activity information on a user's system and to retrieve information from that system. Our web server automatically asks the browser of each new Site user whether it will accept our cookie file. If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our web server will record the cookie's unique ID, and every time the user returns to the Site we will be able to read that cookie's ID number.
In this way, cookies allow us to store information about your preferences, to recognise you when you return to the Site and to determine whether you reached the Site by means of an advertisement or search box on a third party site. This means we can customize and improve the Services we provide to you based on your past preferences and usage history. We can also display targeted advertisements to you in the form of sponsored links based on the IP address information stored in your cookie (for example, advertisements for local services in geographic locations based on your IP address).
In addition, we use, or appoint third parties to use, cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags to track traffic flow and patterns of travel on and within the Site, as well as for internal reporting. This allows us to monitor the popularity of certain features of our Site, the performance of our advertisements on third party sites and the effectiveness of the search terms used to trigger such advertisements.
Certain features of the Site, depend on cookies.
The lifetime of our cookies or those used on our behalf is no more than two years. After any such cookie has expired, all information stored by that cookie is automatically deleted from our servers and those of anyone acting on our behalf.
We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way and, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (see "What information do we disclose or make available to third parties?" below), we do not share the cookie information we collect with third parties, unless required by court or government order, or as otherwise required by law (see "Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements" below).
For information on blocking or removing cookies, please see "How can you block or remove cookies?" below.

Do other third parties use cookies on the Site?
Advertisements on the Site, including the sponsored links that may appear on search results pages, can be served by third parties. The companies that serve these advertisements may, in the course of doing so, place or recognise a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags. This cookie or other technology allows these companies to collect information about your use of the Site and the Internet and to recognise you when you return to the Site, so that customised advertisements can be displayed to you on the Site as well as on other websites based on your past preferences and usage history. These companies can also display advertisements to you based on IP address information stored in the cookie they have placed (for example, advertisements for local services in geographic locations based on your IP address). The advertisements on our site are serviced by Google, Inc using their Google Adsense program. You can find out more about Google Adsense here www.google.com/support/adsense.
In addition, third parties who survey consumer satisfaction with the Internet generally may place cookies and/or pixel tags on the Site for research purposes.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of cookie data that such third parties (as described in the two preceding paragraphs) may collect from you. These third parties will treat your cookie data in accordance with their own policies as to data collection, retention and usage, and we have no control over such policies.
For information on blocking or removing cookies, please see "How can you block or remove cookies?" below.

Do we use your information to deliver targeted online ads to you?
A targeted online ad is one displayed to you based on the content of the web pages you have visited (i.e., your browsing activity generally), information you have provided or keywords you have used in search queries. As described above (see "How do we use the information we collect?"), we use your search queries and the keywords they contain, together with your IP address and any cookie ID associated with you, to provide you with a search results page that may include targeted advertisements in the form of sponsored links. We do not otherwise use your information to display targeted online advertising to you, and we do not provide any of your information to any advertiser whose advertisement you click on or view. However, you should be aware that any such advertiser (or any company serving such advertisements) might be able to deduce certain information about you based on the fact that you have viewed or clicked on their advertisement (see "Do other third parties use cookies on the Site?" above). We have no control over the data collection, retention or usage policies of such third party advertisers or ad serving companies.
