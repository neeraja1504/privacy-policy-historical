Website Visitors
The Williams College website is an information system intended to present an integrated view of the College to prospective students, alumni, the members of the Williams community, and others with an interest in the college. This website uses technologies, including cookies. Cookies are text files placed on your computer by a web server, enabling the site to recognize you and keep track of your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. If you choose to decline cookies, some features on this website may not work properly.
If you visit the Williams website to view or download information, a standard log file will record:
the name of the domain from which you access the Internet
the date and time of your visit
the page/s you visit
your computing platform
This data is used in the aggregate for purposes of analyzing site traffic, managing the site, and providing accountability regarding the usefulness of our work.
If you use our website to complete forms, use our systems, or submit information to us (such as through our alumni and supplier registration pages), we will collect and use the information that you provide to us, as well as information such as your name, username, email address, and mailing address.
Personal information collected on this website is not disclosed to third parties unless the third party is an institutionally authorized provider of services to the college. Users of these services are subject to the privacy policies established by the third-party provider. One such third-party provider of services is Google, Inc. Williams, like many organizations, uses Google Analytics to analyze aggregate website traffic so that we can make the site more useful to our visitors.
The college web site contains links to many outside sites that are beyond our control. Williams is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. This is true even if you use your Williams-college related username to log into an outside site, or if you are connecting to a Williams College-related account on such a platform (for example, the college’s official Facebook page). In these cases, use of your data is governed by the provider’s privacy policies, not by Williams. Public information in posts (e.g., name, user name, comments, status updates, profile info, picture) are always public.
Transfer of Information to the United States
Williams College is located in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union, which means that the data protection laws in the United States may not offer you the same protections as in the country in which you are residing when the personal information is collected. With respect to transfers from the European Union, Williams generally relies on regulatory exceptions that allow for the transfer of information in specific situations. In particular, Williams College collects and transfers personal information to the United States only with your consent, to perform on a contract with you (or in your interest), or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Williams College in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. In some circumstances, the college may enter into standard contractual clauses governing the import of personal information. In all cases, Williams endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal information, particularly sensitive data, and to use it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.
Retention of Data
Williams retains personal information about students and alumni indefinitely for the purpose of alumni relationships, academic record-keeping, and archiving purposes. Other personal information will be retained in accordance with applicable Williams College data retention policies.
Communications from Williams College
Williams College and the Society of Alumni of Williams College periodically send marketing communications to alumni, supporters, and other members of the Williams community, such as newsletters, event invitations, and fundraising information. If you would like to request that
Williams or its Society of Alumni limit or stop these communications with you, please contact us at privacy@Williams.edu. If you ask to be removed from our mailing lists, we will retain your contact information to ensure that we continue to honor your request in the future.

To request that Williams College rectify or erase your information
