The Championships, Wimbledon 2013 - Official Site by IBM - Your Privacy
Introduction
This statement discloses the privacy policy of the official website of The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited (‘AELTC’) and of The Championships, Wimbledon.
The AELTC, also referred to in this Privacy Policy as ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘our’,  is the organisation responsible for day-to-day planning and staging of The Championships, Wimbledon. IBM, as the Official Supplier of Information Technology, provides the equipment and services to build and host the Wimbledon website. We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy.
We explain below the way in which we collect and use your information and personal data. By using the Site, you consent to the use (including transfer) of such information as described below.
What information do we collect, and how do we collect it?
The AELTC intends to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. When you visit the Site, our web servers automatically collect certain data that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website, such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address and information relating to which pages have been viewed. This information is discarded once analysed.
We collect information voluntarily submitted by you, such as your email address and other contact details for correspondence. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Cookies ** **
The Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small file containing an identity code. Your computer accepts the cookie and stores it. When you next visit the Site, the code is retrieved, allowing an individual visitor or computer to be recognised.
Cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including providing personalised web pages and recognising your choice of language. Cookies do not cause harm to your computer, but, if you wish to stop your computer accepting cookies, go to the help section of your internet browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Firefox) where you will find information on how to do this. You can opt out of using cookies at any time.
How the AELTC uses cookies
Cookies on the Wimbledon website are used in the following ways:
i) Analytics
The Wimbledon website uses analytics tools to collect information about how people use its sites. This helps us make sure sites are meeting users’ needs and to find out how we could improve.
Analytics cookies store very simple information about a user’s session, such as what pages people visit, how long they are on the site, how they got there and what they click on. Information supplied by cookies helps the AELTC to analyse the profile of visitors and provide them with a better experience. These cookies expire after a set time period.
Analytics cookies do not collect or store users’ personal information (for example, names or addresses), so this information cannot be used to identify individuals. The AELTC does not allow analytics companies to use or share its analytics data.
ii) Serving advertisements
The advertisements seen on the Wimbledon website are served by a third-party ad serving provider called Sport Syndicator. The system uses cookies to allow monitoring of the effectiveness of the ads (for example, by using statistical analysis cookies) and make the ads more relevant to users.
iii) Third party cookies
Some cookies are not set by the AELTC but by other sites which provide a service or functionality, such as embedded ‘share’ buttons to enable users of the site to easily share articles with their friends through popular social networks. These sites may set a cookie when you are also logged in to their service. These are known as third-party cookies. Managing, deleting or blocking these cookies requires you to visit the websites of these third parties.
How to manage cookies
Internet browsers allow users to manage their cookies. They can set their devices to accept all cookies, to let them know when a cookie has been set, or never to receive cookies.
Each browser works in a different way: use the ‘Help’ menu in your browser to find out to change your cookie preferences. For information on how to do this on the browser of your mobile phone you should refer to your handset manual.
Please be aware that disabling cookies completely means that certain personalised features will not then be provided to that user and therefore they may not be able to make full use of all of the website’s features.
You can learn more about cookies and how to manage them at AboutCookies.org
How do we use your private information? ** **
The ways in which we use your information will vary depending on the kind of information you provide and the purpose for which you have provided it. This section sets out the different ways we may use your information.
