3.4.2. Product recommendations

3.4.3. Interest-based advertising
In order for you to receive information that is likely to be of interest to you, we categorize your user profile. To do so, we use information about your searches to customize the newsletter articles and promotional emails we send you.

The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Processing existing customer data this way for advertising purposes is deemed to be a legitimate interest.
3.4.4. Right to object
You have the right, at any time and at no charge, to object to data processing for the aforementioned purposes, separately for each respective communication channel, and with effect for the future.

In the event that you object, the relevant contact address will be blocked for further promotional processing. We point out that, in exceptional cases, advertising material may temporarily continue to be sent to you even after your objection has been received. This is due to technical reasons related to the lead time required for advertisements and does not mean that your objection will not be observed by us. Thank you for your understanding.
3.5. Cookies – general information
We use cookies on our website on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our interest in optimizing our website is deemed to be legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision.
Cookies are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our website or use our app. Cookies do not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malicious software. The information stored in the cookie is tied to the specific device used. However, this does not mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. In part, cookies are used to make the use of our service more pleasant for you. For example, we use what are known as session cookies to detect that you have already visited individual pages on our website or that you have already logged in to your user account. These are automatically deleted after you leave our website. In addition, to ensure user-friendliness we also use temporary cookies, which are stored on your device for a specific period of time. If you visit our website again to use our services, it is automatically detected that you have already visited us, as well as what information you entered and the settings you used, so that you do not have to reenter them.
If you already have an account and are logged in or activate the "Stay logged in" feature, the information stored in cookies will be added to your user account.
On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record the use of our website, to optimize our services, and to display information tailored to your specific needs. These cookies enable us to automatically detect that you have previously visited us when you return to our website. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or to make sure that a message always appears before a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that you will not be able to use all the features of our website. The storage period of cookies depends on their purpose and therefore varies.

3.6.4. Adjust
In our app, we use the analytics service of Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37A, 10405 Berlin, Germany. The analytics service is implemented in our app via a development environment (SDK - Software Developer Kit). The information generated by the development environment, e.g.

3.6.5. Videobeat
We use the Videobeat analytics software by Videobeat Networks GmbH, Rathausstr. 4, 20095 Hamburg, Germany, for the analysis of television and online marketing activities. Traffic on our website is monitored via a tracking pixel.
Pixels, also known as tracking pixels, are small 1x1-pixel GIF files that can be hidden e.g. in graphics or in e-mails when visiting a website. Pixels do not damage your device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malware.
Through the pixel, IP addresses already collected anonymously are stored together with other data (e.g., operating system or device) in a database. Neither we, nor Videobeat can use that data to identify a concrete person . The information in the database is for the purpose of analysis and evaluation for the production of media plans.
Videobeat’s Privacy Policy can be found here: https://www.videobeat.net/us/data-privacy-policy. You can object to the collection of your data by Videobeat at any time by clicking here: https://pa.videobeat.net/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en.

The information generated by the cookie, such as your browser and pseudonymized IP address, is processed on our servers. The information generated by the cookie in the pseudonymous user profile is not used to personally identify you and is not combined with your personal data.
More information on data protection when using Matomo can be found here: https://matomo.org/privacy-policy. There you can object to website tracking via “Opt-out“.
3.7. Targeting
The targeting measures listed below and used by us are implemented on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Targeting is used to perform targeted advertising. Through the targeting measures we use, we want to make sure that advertisements which are geared to your interests are displayed on your devices.
3.7.1. Double Click
On our website, information used for the optimization of advertisements is collected and evaluated using cookies (see section 3.5.). To do this, we use Google's targeting technologies (Double Click). These technologies enable us to provide you with customized, interest-based advertising. The cookies used provide e.g. information regarding which of our products you are interested in. Based on this information, we can also display services on third-party websites that are specifically oriented towards your interests you have shown through your previous user behavior. The collection and evaluation of your user behavior takes place exclusively in pseudonymized manner and does not enable us to identify you. In particular, the information is not combined with personally identifiable information about you.
The cookie is automatically deleted after 30 days.
You can also set preferences for the display of interest-based advertising through the Google Ads Settings Manager (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl).
For more information and the privacy policy regarding advertising and Google, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl).
3.7.2. Google AdWords
Wimdu Meta uses Google's AdWords service, which uses conversion tracking to measure the effectiveness of individual ads, offers and features. For this, a cookie is set as soon as you click on a Google ad. This cookie does not personally identify you, but rather makes it possible to determine whether you return to the page with the specific offer during the 30-day period in which the cookie is valid.
Each AdWords advertiser receives a different cookie. As a result, cookies cannot be tracked via the website of AdWords advertisers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. We track the total number of users who have clicked on an ad and were redirected to the website with a conversion-tracking tag.
You can permanently prevent the storage of the Google conversion cookie by setting your browser software accordingly. Google's privacy policy on conversion tracking can be found here: https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html.
3.7.3. Google Dynamic Remarketing
We use the features of Google Dynamic Remarketing with the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick.
This feature allows us to link the advertising audiences created with Google Dynamic Remarketing to the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been customized for you based on your past usage and browsing behavior on a device (e.g., smartphone) may also be displayed on another device you use (e.g., tablet or PC).
If you have given the appropriate consent to Google, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, the same personalized advertising messages can appear on any device you use to sign in to your Google Account.
To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users who are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.
You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account. To do so, follow this link: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl.
For more information, as well as the provisions regarding data privacy, please see the Google Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl.
3.7.4. Google AdSense
On our website, we use Google AdSense for displaying advertisements. In this way we can show you advertisements that may be of interest to you. These advertisements can be recognized by the reference "Google Ads". To do this, Google uses web beacons and cookies (see section 3.5.). The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of the website (including your IP address) and delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. Google may share this information with third parties.
We have enabled third-party Google AdSense ads. The data may be transferred to third parties (named at https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/94149).
You can prevent Google AdSense from installing cookies by disabling interest-based ads on Google via the link https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl.
For more information, as well as the provisions regarding data privacy, please see the Google Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl.
3.7.5. Google AdMob
We use Google AdMob to display ads in the Wimdu Meta app. Google uses the Apple "Advertising Identifier" (hereafter “Apple Ad-ID”) for advertising control in the app. A pseudonymized user profile is created under the Apple Ad-ID so that the user can be matched to different advertising segments on the Apple advertising platform in order to be able to display interest-based advertising.
The Apple Ad-ID is a pseudonym that prevents personal plain data from being disclosed to Google. The Apple Ad-ID is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there.
You can prevent the use of the Apple Ad-ID by clicking on "No Ad-Tracking" under "Privacy/Advertising" in your system settings. Alternatively, you can also click “Reset Ad ID” to generate a new, randomly chosen Apple Ad ID and thus prevent a profile from being generated.
3.7.6. Criteo
Pixel technologies (see section 3.6.5.) from Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France ("Criteo") collect and store data for marketing and optimization purposes.
The pixels send your IP address, the Referrer URL of the visited website, the time when the pixel was viewed, the browser used and previously set cookie information to a web server. This data can be used to create usage profiles under a pseudonym.
Criteo's pixel technologies allow us to evaluate our advertising campaigns and advertising content. Using an algorithm, Criteo analyzes surfing behavior and can then display targeted product recommendations as personalized advertising banners on other websites (“publishers”). You can find more information about Criteo’s technology in Criteo’s Privacy Policy (https://www.criteo.com/privacy).
Using Criteo will load additional pixels from contractual partners with whom Criteo works. An overview of all publishers and networks that load pixels can be found at https://www.criteo.com/privacycriteo-works-with-the-following-platforms/. The data collected with Criteo technology will not be used to determine the personal identity of the website visitor unless agreed to separately by the data subject. Any use of data other than that described above or transfer to third parties is excluded.
Most browsers accept pixels automatically. You can use the appropriate tools or browser add-ons to prevent the use of pixels on our website (for example, by using the "AdBlock" add-on for the Firefox browser).
You can also object to the pseudonymous analysis of your surfing behavior by us at any time. For instructions on disabling Criteo's service, please visit the following Criteo link: https://www.criteo.com/privacy.
