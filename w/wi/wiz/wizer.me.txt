The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User's use of  the Wizer.me Platform   (  “  Non-personal Information  ”  ).  We are not aware of the identity of the User from which the Non-personal Information was collected  . Non-personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on  the Wizer.me Platform  , type of operation system, User's 'click-stream' on  the Wizer.me Platform   and/or any e-commerce websites operated by third parties (including Third Party Services, as such term is defined in the Terms), browser type, language and keyboard language, etc.

Personal Information which may be gathered consists of the following:
The User's IP address or other persistent user identifier, which is automatically provided by the User  and used mainly for enhancing the User's experience and for geolocation personalization and security purposes, as further detailed below;
