Privacy Policy
This site is hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Please see theYahoo!

** Security
We are very aware of how important it is to today's Internet consumers to know their order information is "secure". That's why we use “Secure Socket Layers“ (“SSL”)** , an advanced encryption technology that protects your credit card information. SSL encodes all ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so no one can ever read it. When you place an order with us, your credit card information is taken and stored separately so only we can read it. There is absolutely nothing to be concerned about.
Privacy Policy
At WizardUniverse.com , we have a "No Sharing" policy. You can feel comfortable knowing all your personal information used in the ordering process is for us and US ONLY. We know this is a very sensitive subject, and therefore have made this our #1 most strict policy. There are absolutely no exceptions!
