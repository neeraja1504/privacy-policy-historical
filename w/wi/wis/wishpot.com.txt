Privacy Policy | Wishpot
Last Revised: November 10, 2006
This privacy policy ("Policy") explains when and how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to our web site located at www.wishpot.com (the "Site"). By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any changes in our privacy practices. Please carefully review this policy whenever you visit our Site so you understand our data privacy practices and can make an informed decision about using our Site.
What is Personal Information?
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
Personal Information We Collect
We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our Site. At several places on our Site, we may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we collect personal information, such as your name, address, photograph and other contact and demographic information when you: (1) register and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post an entry or (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving comments, providing a review, inviting a friend, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive forums or features on the site. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.
When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". For more information on how we use cookies and other information that we automatically collect, please see the section below entitled "Cookies, IP Addresses and URLs"
