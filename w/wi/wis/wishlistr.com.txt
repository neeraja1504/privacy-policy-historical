a. Personal Information from Users
Visitors to our website must register in order to use the services. When you register, we will request some personal information such as name and email. Other information including, but not limited to, birthday, location, and web site address is optional.
We will not disclose any personally identifiable information we collect from you to third parties without your permission, except to the extent necessary, including:
To fulfill your requests for service.

b. Our Use of Cookies
Digital Venues, like many other web sites, use cookies to personalize and enhance your user experience on the web site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Our use of cookies may include both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used while you are logged in on the Wishlistr web site. Session cookies are, unlike persistent cookies, deleted from your computer once you log out and/or close your web browser. Persistent cookies are, for example, placed on your computer if you use our bookmarklet or "Remember me" feature during login.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on our Website.
c. Third Party Cookies.
Our website may contain affiliate marketing links in both editorial and user generated content. Such affiliate links will usually place a cookie on your computer once clicked. These affiliate partnerships enables us to provide you this service free of cost, and without any advertisement on your wish list.
All user generated content, as well as our own editorial content, is not influenced by any advertiser or affiliate partnership, and we use a third party to handle all affiliate partnerships for us. We encourage you to read through their privacy policy for more information on how they use cookies and protect your privacy.

Related services and offerings with links from this website, including vendor sites, have their own privacy statements that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. Online merchants and others who participate in Digital Venues services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.
