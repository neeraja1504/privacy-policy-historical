Privacy Policy
Personal data is data that relates to or is capable of identifying a living person. Account Holderâ€™s privacy is very important to us and we do all we can to protect it.
The main purpose of this Privacy Policy is to make you aware of the information we may gather about you, how we may use it, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information. Words and phrases in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the WishFree.com Terms and Conditions Agreement.

The information we collect
Personal data:
When you first sign-up for the WishFree.com, we ask for your name and email address and other personal information we may also ask for your choice of payment method, whether PayPal or COD. In addition we usually also capture your IP address. Other personal information about you is then optional to provide.
We will retain your personal data for as long as is permitted for legal, regulatory and fraud prevention purposes.

Security
We're committed to protecting your personal information. All information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers and access to this database is restricted internally. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we use reduce the possibility of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.
Access to your Account is password-protected for your privacy and security. While we do our best to protect your personal information you also must protect yourself. What does this mean?
Keep your password or other access information secret.
Ensure no-one else uses WishFree.com while your machine is "signed in" to the WishFree.com site. Make sure you sign out from your Account when not using it.
Sharing
We may share (whether or not for payment) aggregated demographic information with our partners, clients and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
We may also use such aggregated information and statistics for monitoring the Website usage in order to help us develop Website and our services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties.
Editing your Account and mailing settings
We like to keep in touch with our Account Holders so after you have signed up to WishFree.com we'll send you information about games/products or services provided by us.
Of course we know lots of emails can be annoying so we try to keep ours to a minimum. However, if you feel you're getting too many or would like more you can change the settings in your Account at any time. Each communication gives you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving similar future communications. You can review, change or correct your identity and email address information by signing into your Account and going to the settings tab.
Please note there are some communications that are an integral part of the WishFree.com and cannot be opted-out of. These communications cover, amongst other things, changes to the WishFree.com and your actual or potential transactions.
