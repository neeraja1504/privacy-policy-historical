Welcome to Wit.ai, Inc.

Wit is committed to protecting the privacy of all those who access or use our Service ("you," or "Users"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to our website, located at https://wit.ai, and the Wit Platform (collectively, our "Service").

In all of these cases, our software has been integrated into developers' products or applications and, to the extent that we process Customer Data, we do so on the behalf of developers for the purpose of providing the Service to them and in accordance with the Terms of Service. For clarity, the processing of Customer Data (in respect of which Wit acts as a Data Processor, not a Data Controller) is not governed by this Policy. Please check with the relevant developer about the policies it has in place to protect the personal data of its End Users.
