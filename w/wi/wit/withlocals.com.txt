Any new features and/or services that are added to our current service at any point in the future shall also be subject to this Privacy Policy. Please familiarize yourself with it. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read we have provided additional everyday language summaries as a guide.
1. Applicability
When you visit our website or use our services you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.
Withlocals B.V. (from here on referred to as "Withlocals", "we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding how we collect, use, manage, store, transfer and disclose the personal information that we receive from users of www.withlocals.com (the "Site"), our services and our application for mobile devices (the "Application") regardless of how you use or access them.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us via the Site and the Application. We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes to our services. We will do this by amending the Privacy Policy on the website. The changes will take effect automatically, as soon as they are posted on the site. In addition, we will notify all users by email if any material changes are made to the Privacy Policy.
In regards to this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include but are not limited to; the use of cookies, the collection, storing, transfer, evaluation, deletion, disclosure, management, handling, modifying and use of data.
2. International transfer
We process your personal information in the European Union.
Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers and servers that are located outside of your country of residence or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
Withlocals is based in The Netherlands. All information captured via the site will be transferred, held and processed in the European Union. By using the site and submitting your information you agree that your information can be transferred, stored and processed there.
3. Information collection and use
We collect information to improve our services and/or website.
We collect information primarily to provide you with access to our services and tools and to provide you with relevant and personalized customer service.
The information collected on our site may also be used to improve our site and the services, features and applications that we offer.
4. Personally Identifiable Information
We need some basic personal identifiable information in order to provide you with our services. If we ask more information, it is used to further enhance your experience of our services.
You can browse our site without having to submit personal information. If you register with us through the Site or Application you are no longer anonymous to us, however.
When you register with us through the Site or Application and when you choose to serve as a Host or book as a Traveler, or when you wish to contact another visitor via our website, we will ask you for personal information that can identify you and be used to contact you ("Identity Information").
Identity Information includes, but is not limited to; your name, phone number, email address, home address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. If you choose to provide us with personal information you consent to that information being transferred and stored on servers in the European Union.
Some personal information is required in order to provide the service, for example: your name and email address. Other personal information is optional, including your date of birth. We reserve the right to require address confirmation if you are hosting events.
Personal information is also used for the personalization of your Withlocals Account profile (without limitation, individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").
Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information. We may occasionally combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and use it to statistically evaluate the service and users, in order to provide better customer service and to improve the usability of the Site.
We also use your personal information to contact you with occasional Withlocals newsletters and other information that may be of interest to you. You can decide at any time to opt out of these promotional and marketing communications by following the instructions for unsubscribing, which can be found on the Site.
5. Log data

8. Information needed from Travelers and Hosts
When you book or host an event, we need to share some information to facilitate your experience and provide the best customer service.
If you post an Event, we may publish that Event publicly via the Site and Application and may enable third parties to publish your Event on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget".

When a Host confirms a booking we will share some of the Host’s Identify Information with the traveler via email, including, but not limited to; first and last name, phone number, the address where the Event takes place, and the Host’s email address, with the applicable Traveler selected by the Host.
We will share some of the Traveler’s Identify Information with the Host, including, but not limited to; first and last name, phone number and email address, so that the Traveler and the Host may contact one another directly. Under no circumstance is a Traveler’s Billing Information ever shared with a Host.

We may also, on occasion, provide personal information to trusted entities and third parties for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.
You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.
10. Compliance with laws
We will disclose information when required by law.
It may be necessary for Withlocals to disclose your personal information whether by law, litigation, legal process and / or by request from public or governmental authorities within or outside of your country of residence.

12. Security
We take security very seriously.
Withlocals is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We take several precautions to safeguard against loss, misuse and theft of information.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or Paypal address) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). This keeps your information safe while it is transferred over the internet. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are advised not to share sensitive data publicly. If you have any questions about security on our Site and Application, you can contact us.
In the event of any breach of security Withlocals will make any legally required disclosures concerning the breach and the confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" to you via email or via a posting on the Site and Application without unreasonable delay in as far as it is consistent with any legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures required to determine the scope of the breach and to safeguard the integrity of data.
13. Links to other websites
When we link to other websites, it’s just a link, nothing more.
Our Site and Application contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit one of these Sites by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or by clicking on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website.
The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
If you choose to visit any of these third party websites you are governed by their Privacy Policies and Practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these.
