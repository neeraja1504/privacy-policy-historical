Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor your privacy. WritersWeekly.com utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you place an order with us, your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order. It cannot be read by anyone other than our staff. Only customers using browsers that support SSL can complete their order online using secure transactions.
If you don’t have a browser that supports SSL or if you feel uncomfortable sending your credit card information via the web, we offer you the option of faxing us to complete your order. Once you’ve selected the items you want to order you will have the option to proceed with your order online or to fax us with your credit card number or a copy of your check.
