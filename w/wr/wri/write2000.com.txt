How do we use the personal and non-personal information that we gather?
We use personally identifiable information for shipping and billing purposes, to respond to consumers’ requests, to provide consumers with special offers and to notify consumers of new product launches. Like most web sites, we may also add to the above personally identifiable information a variety of non-personal information such as: technical data including (but not limited to) your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain and web browser information. We may track the page you visited before coming to our site, the page you link to when you leave, which of our pages you access and how long you spend on each page.

What about children’s privacy?
The site is not targeted to children, however, we do store information about children under the age of 13 that has been provided by parents or teachers for use in our online applications to improve the reading ability of children. We do not sell products for purchase by children; we sell children’s products for purchase by adults. Information collected from parents or legal guardians includes children’s name and grade. Parents have access to summary data collected for their child and can request a complete record of data including their child’s performance data within our online reading assessment and improvement courses. This data includes name, class assignment (when used through a school or institution) and all performance and assessment data collected. Summary information is accessible through the Parent/Student Report tab which is available within the student login area. Parents can review their child’s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child’s information. If at any time you decide that you would like your child’s information removed from our records, or would like to request all data collected on your child, please send an e-mail to info@readingplus.com with your name in the subject line and include your request within the body of the email.
