LEARN More
Like most standard websites or online services, WRAL.com and other Services may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology that improve the user’s experience by allowing the website to recognize the user’s computer or device. You may configure your browser to reject cookies. If you do so, you might not be able to log-in to your account, access important functions, features and activities or enjoy certain conveniences or customized and personalized features of our Site and other Services. Click here for more information about cookies, web beacons and IP Addresses.
If you do not want to help us improve our Site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by clicking here.
If you leave WRAL.com to visit our Advertisers' websites, some of those Advertisers also may place cookies on your computer. We don't have access to those cookies or to any information they contain, and the use and collection of your Personal Information by Advertisers is governed by the Advertiser's Privacy Policy, which may be different from ours.
Because cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site or other Services, you can set your browser to decline cookies and can delete them from your computer. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may need to re-enter your log-in information each time you visit our Site and Services, and you may not be able to take advantage of various features or activities.
We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes. Specific information regarding your choice to opt-out to such use will be provided when the new technology, service, or feature is introduced.
4. Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We will not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with unaffiliated companies or people except: 1) as necessary to provide you with products or services you've requested; 2) when we have your permission; or 3) as follows:
We will disclose your Personal Information to trusted partners and Operational Service Providers who work on our behalf under confidentiality agreements. These entities will use your Personal Information to help us serve you. However, these entities are not allowed to share your Personal Information without authorization or to use it for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
We will disclose your Personal Information to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process, whether or not a response is required by applicable law.
We will disclose your Personal Information to enforce our TOU, or to protect the rights, property or safety of CBC, other users and visitors, our Advertisers and other customers, the public, or our employees.
As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event that all or some of our assets are acquired by another company, Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.
5. How we protect your Personal Information
We have taken reasonable steps to protect the security and confidentiality of the Personal Information we collect and use. We implement and maintain reasonable physical, technical and administrative procedures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized collection, use, disclosure, and disposal and request our Operational Service Providers to do the same. However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that the information that you supply to us won't be intercepted during transmission over the Internet.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your accounts, especially on a shared computer or device, by logging out when you are finished using our Site and other Services and by keeping any passwords confidential. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.
Additionally, we cannot control and therefore cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of your Personal Information that you make publicly available.
6. Customized Content & Advertising
Advertising helps us to support the free Services, Internet and broadcast content we provide to you. We use anonymous, aggregated information to serve customized ads. (For example, we are able to provide the age range, gender, and geographic location of the audience our Advertisers will be reaching.) When we aggregate your information, no specific individual can be identified.
We, our Operational Service Providers, and Advertisers use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology to enrich your experience on our Services by serving relevant, tailored and personalized advertising and/or content. (Please note that we do not control Advertiser cookies or web beacons, and their use of such technology is not subject to this Privacy Policy.) Customized advertising and content is based on information you provide to us; your use of our content, features and activities; your visits, search, transaction and/or purchase history; visits to our Facebook Fan page or use of other Facebook features and services, or other social network platforms, and/or projections made about you based on all of these elements. (Click here for information about IP Addresses, cookies and web beacons.)

To opt-out of Network Advertising, please click here.
Please be aware that opting out of a Network Advertising service doesn't mean that you will not receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests, but you will continue to receive advertising.
7. Safeguarding Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Generally, we will not knowingly collect online Personal Information or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age. Should we discover that a child under the age of 13 submitted Personal Information to our Site, apps, or other Internet-based Services without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will immediately reject any such entry and delete that information from our database (to the extent technically feasible), unless such information meets an exception under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
Comments that pertain to programming or operations of our Stations are subject to Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations that require television licensees to post such comments in the applicable Station’s FCC Public Inspection File. Except to meet FCC, or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not knowingly use, distribute or disclose any child's Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without prior parental consent. We will promptly remove such information from our database (to the extent technically feasible) if a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use of the child’s Personal Information.

8. Your choices for the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information
Users who no longer wish to receive alerts, notifications, or promotional messages from us via email may choose to unsubscribe via the Mailing List Admin page on WRAL.com, WRALSportsFan.com, HighSchoolOT.com, AmericanTobaccoHistoricDistrict.com, WRALTechWire.com and WILM-TV.com. All emails and newsletters also include opt-out instructions. Alerts sent via text message also have an opt-out mechanism.
We may share your Personal Information directly with our Advertisers for their direct marketing and promotional purposes only if you have granted your permission to do so. Depending on the activity, event or feature, you will have an opportunity to either “opt-in” or “opt-out” of such sharing at the time of registration, delivery of the activity, event or feature, or by contacting the Service via this feedback form.
You must use the designated method to notify us of your opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely. Please be aware that we may continue to contact you for administrative, transactional or informational purposes related to your use of our Services, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not considered to be unsolicited commercial messages.
9. How to access, update, correct, or delete your Personal Information
You can access and edit your registration information, including your e-mail address and options for receiving news and information and advertising emails, and can delete your registration and member name at any time by going to the Registration page. If you terminate your site registration, your email address will remain in our archived records after your account has been closed given the technical limitations of our system. However it will be moved to an inactive status.
For mobile apps, you may access and update or change your Personal Information via "Settings." You may also delete an app or disable a service according to your device settings. For other Services, please access your account or send an e-mail to our Privacy Administrator.
We retain your Personal Information as long as it takes to provide the Services and as required by our corporate policies and laws. Upon your request, we also will remove your Personal Information from our active database(s). Given the limitations of our computer systems, corporate business policies, and the requirements of federal or state laws, we may not be able to delete all of your Personal Information from our internal or back-up files. You may be entitled to access such Personal Information or restrict the use of such Information under local or state laws. Please contact our Privacy Administrator. MORE.
10. Hyperlinks to Third Party Websites
Our Sites and users who post information on those sites may provide links to third party websites whose privacy policies, terms and conditions, and/or business practices we do not control, including the use of cookies, web beacons or other monitoring technologies When you access another website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you're visiting. When linking to another website a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on this Site and our Services.
11. Notification of changes to Privacy Policy
Because the web is an evolving medium and we strive to use new technology to provide innovative features and activities, we will need to change our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our Site and applicable Services and update the "Last Updated/ Effective Date." For material changes, we will also notify you via email, push alert, or the preferred mode of contact you selected. However, we are not able to notify you of changes in our app privacy policy via the app given technical limitations. Such notification must be provided via other means as listed above. By continuing to use this Site or other Services after we post any such changes, you have accepted the Privacy Policy as modified.
