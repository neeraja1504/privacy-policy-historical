TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
Personally-Identifiable Information. The only personally-identifiable information we collect is information that our visitors voluntarily provide to us when using our Web Site. For example, if you are an advertiser and use our Web Site to request a contact from our sales department, we will ask for your name, email address and other contact information so that a WhenU sales representative or, in some cases, a WhenU reseller, can respond to your inquiry. Consumers and partners can use our Web Site to request technical support or other information from WhenU or to comment about any aspect of our operations. We use the contact information they provide to respond to their inquiries. We will not sell or rent to third parties information you may choose to provide through our online information request forms or use such information for purposes unrelated to your request for information or comments. We will not combine personally-identifiable information that you may choose to disclose through this Web Site with information about you that is available from any other source. If you want to contact WhenU but do not wish to reveal information about yourself online, you can reach a WhenU representative by telephone at 212-239-0000, or write to us at:

You will receive an order confirmation, subscription renewal notices, and promotional mailings about other WhenU products.

Browser Level Information and IP Addresses
Our Web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our Web Site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running and your IP address. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by all computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. We use your IP address to deliver our Web pages to you on request. On occasion, we may also use your IP address for troubleshooting purposes to help diagnose problems with our server. The browser-level information we collect is stored in an anonymous form and is not linked to your personally-identifiable information. We use the browser level information we collect to make our Web Site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.
Cookies
A standard feature of browser software enables Web site publishers to place a small text file called a "cookie" on a visitor's hard drive. Our cookies don't reveal personal information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information that you voluntarily supply. We use a cookie to remember the user name and login ID entered by advertisers and partners to access the external reporting system operated on a secure area of our Web Site. A cookie is inserted for this purpose only if the advertiser or partner has selected the "remember me" feature when he or she entered a password and login ID. We also use a cookie to authenticate users' login information as they navigate the reporting system pages of our Web Site. We do not use cookies to collect any personally-identifiable information and we do not track any of your activity on the Internet outside of our Web Site. For example, we do not use cookies to track which Web sites our visitors come from when they enter our site or which sites they go to when they leave our site. We use the services of a third-party software vendor to improve the performance of our Web site. This vendor assigns cookies to users' machines that help us manage traffic on our Web site. These cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
WhenU is the sole owner of the information gathered through this Web Site. We will not sell or rent your personally-identifiable information to third parties and we will share your information with others only under the circumstances described below:
Credit Card Payments
WhenU uses a third-party credit card processing company to process payments for products purchased on our Web Site. If you order a product on our Web Site, we will share your credit card and billing information with this processing company to complete your transaction. The credit card processor that we use is not authorized to retain, share, store or use your credit card or billing information for purposes unrelated to processing payment for the transactions that you initiated.
Sales Inquiries
If you use our Web Site to request information about purchasing advertising services from WhenU, we may forward your inquiry and contact information to one of our third-party resellers if we believe that the reseller would be in the best position to assist you. Our resellers are not authorized to use your contact information for any reason other than to respond to your request for information about WhenU's services.
Service Providers
From time to time, WhenU may contract with third-party service providers to help us operate our site, conduct other aspects of our business, or improve the services that we provide to you. Some of these service providers may be given access to personally-identifiable information collected through this Web Site, but only if we deem such access to be necessary to perform the services that we request. In these circumstances, we will require our service providers to commit that they will not use the personally identifiable information they receive from WhenU for any purposes other than those dictated by us.
Other Disclosures
We reserve the right to release any information about our visitors when we form a good faith belief that such a release is necessary to comply with the law, subpoenas or other valid legal process, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to report or collect debts owed, or to protect the rights, property or safety of WhenU, our Web Site visitors, or others. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event that WhenU or substantially all of our assets are acquired by another company, the information that we collect from our Web Site visitors may be included among the transferred assets.
