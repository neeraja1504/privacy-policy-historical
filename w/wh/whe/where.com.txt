Privacy Policy | WHERE
About the Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used and disclosed when you visit and use our Website located at www.where.com (the “Website”) and the WHERE® mobiles services (“WHERE”) provided by Where, Inc. (“we”, or “us”) and accessed through your mobile device. Please read this notice very carefully.
By using WHERE, you represent that you are at least 14 years old or older and consent to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy, as may be modified by us from time to time.
Personally Identifying Information
As used herein, the term “personal identifying information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual’s location or activities, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personally identifying information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you.
All information that registered users opt to provide to Where, Inc. for the purpose of creating a User Profile is stored. However, this information will not be used for any other purpose other than for the User Profiles. We will not sell, market, or divulge this information to any third-party.
Personally identifying information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of WHERE or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifying information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Website. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
Gathering of Personally Identifying Information
The amount and type of information that Where, Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, users who sign up to use WHERE may opt to provide an email address for alerts and notifications. In each case, Where, Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with WHERE. Users always have the option to refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain WHERE-related activities.
WHERE is not intended for use by children under 14. If you believe that a child has provided Where, Inc. with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at support@where.com. If Where, Inc. becomes aware that a child under age 14 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information.
Use of Information
We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personally identifying information. For instance, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities. However, Where, Inc. does not disclose such personally identifying information to any third parties.
We may also collect statistics about the behavior of WHERE users. For instance, Where, Inc. may monitor the most popular WHERE services and display an aggregated view of this information publicly or provide it to others. We treat this information as personally identifying information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.
We do not associate personally identifiable information with location data unless you have provided your express permission for us to do so – e.g., registering for the WHERE’s My Phone service.
We do not collect, maintain or track your location history.  We do not enable or allow location tracking in any form. We do store ‘last known location’ on your mobile device, but only to establish a location context when you launch WHERE.
You understand that when you use WHERE, certain information that you post on www.where.com or provide through WHERE may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of WHERE, including without limitation your profile, comments, and photographs. In addition, you should be aware that (i) Location Data and other information that you post on www.where.com and WHERE that are not designated as private may be publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone.
Aggregate information and Location Data may be shared with carriers, Service Providers and other third parties in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If the Location Data is shared with carriers, Service Providers and other third parties then it will be done so in a way to keep your anonymity. Location Data will not be shared in such a way as to be personally identifiable.
