Information We Collect
The types of personal information we may obtain through the Site include:
• contact information (such as name, email address and zip code);
• gender;
• date of birth; and
• information about movies and television shows that may interest you (such as titles of trailers you search for or watch).
In addition, when you visit our Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and JavaScript.
Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Our Site may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies) and Flash cookies, as well as other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of the Site or other websites and online services.
In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to our Site. We also may log information about your interaction with the Site, such as which pages you visit on the Site. To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. We also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Site.
The providers of third-party plug-ins and widgets on our Site, such as embedded videos and social media sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Site and your interactions with the plug-ins and widgets. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of the providers of the plug-ins and widgets.
How We Use the Information We Collect
We may use the information described above to:
• provide you with online and in-person viewing options for movies and television shows, as well as other products and services;
• send you promotional materials or other communications;
• communicate with you about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, promotions, offers, surveys and market research;
• respond to your inquiries;
• perform data analyses (including market and consumer research, demographic analyses and anonymization and aggregation of personal information);
• operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing and improving our products and services; managing our communications; analyzing our products, services and communications; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
• protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities; and
• comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies.
In addition to the purposes listed above, we may use information collected through automated means for other purposes. For example, we may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Site because we engage in retargeting administered by third-party vendors. These vendors track your online activities over time and across third-party websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on third-party websites based on your previous visits to the Site. The information our vendors collect on the Site includes information about your visits to Site, such as the pages or advertisements you viewed and the actions you took on the Site. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn more about how to opt out of retargeting, click here.
We also may use information collected through automated means to customize your visit to our Site, (ii) analyze the manner in which you interact with our Site, (iii) deliver content (including advertising) tailored to your interests and the manner in which you browse our Site, and (iv) manage our Site and other aspects of our business. We may supplement data we collect through automated means with information about your location (such as your zip code) to provide you with content that may be of interest to you. We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our Site, identify users of our Site and gather demographic information about our users.
In addition, we may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.
We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you through the Site, except as described in this Online Privacy Notice. We may share personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf.

To fulfill your requests and in connection with various functionalities offered by the Site, we may disclose certain information about you to the MPAA family of companies, video service providers (such as YouTube), content distribution networks, social media providers and affiliate providers (such as Netflix).
