Our website uses Social Plugins (“Plugins”) from the social network, facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto; CA 94304, USA. The Plugins are recognizable through one of the Facebook logos (e.g., the white F on a blue tile or the “thumbs-up” symbol), or are labeled with the phrase: “Facebook Social Plugin.” The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed at: https://developers.facebook.com/plugins. When you visit one of our webpages that contains such a Plugin, your browser makes a direct connection to Facebook’s servers. Facebook will transmit the contents of the Plugin directly to your browser and embed it in the website. Therefore, we have no influence over the range of data that Facebook collects through these Plugins and can, therefore, only inform you to the best of our knowledge: through the embedded Plugins, Facebook receives data pertaining to the correlating information you call up on our website. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can associate this information with your Facebook account. When you interact with the Plugins (for example, by clicking the like button or leaving a comment), the corresponding information is transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook, where it is saved. Even if you do not have a Facebook account, it might still be possible for Facebook to determine and save your IP address. For more information regarding the purpose and scope of the data collection, the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, your rights (and settings options) pertaining to the protection of your privacy, please consult Facebook’s privacy policy at: https//www.facebook.com/policy.php. If you have a Facebook account, but would not like Facebook to collect data about you through our website and connect it to the stored data for your profile, then you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. It is also possible to block Facebook Social Plugins with browser add-ons, such as the “Facebook Blocker.”
