Privacy Policy - WhichTestWon
If you followed this link, you care about privacy, and we’re glad because we do as well. This Privacy Policy describes the information that we (WhichTestWon LLC, or “WhichTestWon”) collect through our website located at www.whichtestwon.com (the “Website”), and how we use that information.  If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at customerservice@whichtestwon.com.
The Types of Information that We Collect
We collect two types of information from visitors to our Website: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is information that may be used to identify or locate an individual and includes email address, telephone number or postal address. We generally don’t collect PII via the Website unless it is provided to us.
For example, if you purchase our products or services we may request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.  This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date.  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you.
In addition, if you contact us by email through our Website, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.  We reserve the right to use your email address and any other PII that you provide to us to respond to your inquiries and to send you marketing materials for our own products and services.  Certain of our uses are non-exhaustively described below.  We will not share your information with outside parties who wish to market other products and services to you.
We also collect non-personally identifiable information via this Website (“Non-PII”) such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer or device you are using, the type of browser and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our Website, the website referrer address and other log file information.  We use analytics technology to measure and optimize our site’s performance, including solutions provided by third parties.  Like most websites, our Website uses “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, “cookies” and/or similar tracking technologies that allow us to track the actions of visitors to our Website. We use this information to help us improve our Website and the products, services, applications, content and features that we provide. We reserve the right to aggregate this information with similar data collected from other visitors to the Website for any purpose, including publishing aggregate statistics about our clients and/or Website visitors.  We may also serve cookies from trusted third party partners, for example our email service provider, which hosts our email opt-in offer.
Newsletter
If you signed up for our newsletter, we will send you our regular periodic newsletter along with occasional special announcements — for example if we have a webinar registration deadline, or info on a special offer from a relevant vendor. However, we will never give a third party your email address for the purposes of a ‘blast’.
Webinar and Content Signups
We use third party vendors for webinar registrations and management.  Your interactions with those third parties are governed pursuant to their respective privacy policies.  While we reserve the right to change these vendors in the future, any web forms and webinar management systems will be evaluated for security prior to implementation.
We and any presentation partner(s) or sponsors will have access and permission to contact people who signed up for a presentation.  For example, we’ll email you with a reminder beforehand and a ‘thank you’ afterward, and you may get a separate communication from the event sponsor.  We may also email you on occasion to let you know about other relevant events WhichTestWon is going to host.
Contact Us Form
Queries via our Contact Us form are held pursuant to this Privacy Policy. We will endeavor to reply directly to your question or query, and will store your information in our own customer service database in order to keep track of it for the future.
