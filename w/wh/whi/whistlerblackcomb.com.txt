Privacy Policy | Whistler Blackcomb
Whistler Blackcomb’s mission is to create memories as the best mountain experience again and again. We are proud of the relationships we have developed with our guests, and protecting their personal information is of utmost importance to us. Privacy legislation sets out rules how organizations such as ours can collect, use and disclose an individual’s personal information. This Policy outlines the principles and practices we follow to protect privacy.

(together, “Whistler Blackcomb”).
This Policy outlines principles and practices we follow in protecting personal information of guests and other individuals we may interact with in our business other than employees (a separate policy applies to employees).
PERSONAL INFORMATION
When we use the term “personal information”, we mean information about an identifiable individual such as someone’s home address, birth date, gender and family status.   Personal information does not include an individual’s business contact information such as name, title, and business address.  Personal information does not include aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual.
Type of Personal Information We Collect
The type of information we collect depends on your relationship with us and how you use our products and services.  General examples include:

information collected through scanning of lift passes or otherwise as facilities are used, which information may include geographic location and the frequency of use of facilities;
photographs and videos that may be taken when facilities are used.
Purpose for Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
The primary reason we collect, use and disclose personal information is to provide products and services to guests, and to establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with guests.  This may include:
booking and selling lift tickets, passes, lessons, tours, programs, and events;
booking and selling accommodation, transportation and other travel-related services;
booking and renting ski, snowboard, bike and other equipment;
verifying identity if necessary for certain products and services we provide;

providing guests with information about their use of facilities at Whistler Blackcomb Resort, such as number of runs or trails completed, how often and which lifts were ridden, and vertical distance skied or ridden;
providing guests with a means to combine lift use information with their online profile so that information can be shared with friends and family;
providing guests with medical services, including emergency medical services in the event that they are involved in an accident while participating in activities or using the facilities at Whistler Blackcomb Resort;
developing, enhancing, marketing, selling, or otherwise providing products and services of Whistler Blackcomb;
marketing, selling, or otherwise providing products and services of third parties with whom Whistler Blackcomb has a commercial relationship.
We may also collect, use and disclose personal information:
to meet legal and regulatory requirements;
to assist administration and management of our business and operations, including transfer of data within the Whistler Blackcomb family of businesses;
for other purposes identified to individuals or purposes obvious to individuals, in particular cases.
How We Collect Personal Information
In most cases we collect personal information directly from individuals, such as when they make an inquiry, request a product or service, in the course of providing that product or service, or when they have other dealings with us.   We may also collect personal information from other individuals who we believe have authority to provide such information, such as a parent, spouse or other family member who makes a purchase or booking on the individual’s behalf.  We may also collect personal information relevant to creditworthiness from other sources.
We may collect and update an individual’s personal information when they deal with us over the phone, by email, by fax, when they visit our websites or visit us in person, when they write to us, or if they participate in marketing surveys, campaigns, contests or competitions.
We also use technology that may collect information about an individual’s geographic location when they ride our lifts, by scanning their lift pass and using passive radio frequency readers mounted near our lifts.  We may combine this information with other personal information we have collected from an individual.
We may also collect personal information from third parties, such as a travel agent or travel wholesaler through which a booking is made. ****
Internet
When an individual visits our websites, we collect information that is automatically sent to us from the individual’s web browser.   Such information typically includes the visitor’s IP address; the name and version of the visitor’s operating system; the type and version of the browser in use; the date and time of visits to the site; and the pages accessed.  If the visitor was redirected by way of a link from another site, we may also record the page of site previously visited.
The information we receive depends on the settings of the visitor’s browser.   Such browsing information may be used to create statistics that help us understand our guests and their needs and help us improve our websites and ensure they are compatible with the technology used by our visitors.  Such information may also be used for marketing purposes and to help us improve a visitor’s experience on our websites.  We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of administering our systems, to report traffic data to our corporate partners, and to audit the use of our websites.  Although the information provided to us by a visitor’s web browser does not identify the visitor personally, such information may be combined with other information to identify a visitor personally.
We also use “cookies” to help us provide customized services and as a means to collect dependable and consistent traffic data.   A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is sent to a user’s browser from a web server and stored on a user’s hard drive.  Whistler Blackcomb and third party advertising providers may use cookies when placing advertisements on Whistler Blackcomb websites.  Anonymous data based on cookies and user IP addresses may be used to deliver advertisements that are likely to be of particular interest to a user.  Cookies can be disabled in a user’s web browser.
We may hire other companies to place our banner advertisements on other websites. Those companies may perform tracking and reporting activities on the advertisements they serve for us, as well as user reaction.   Such companies would not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviours associated with those IP addresses on our behalf.
Disclosure of Personal Information
Whistler Blackcomb may disclose an individual's personal information to:
a person who in the reasonable judgment of Whistler Blackcomb is seeking the information as an agent of the individual;
a company or individual employed by Whistler Blackcomb to perform functions on its behalf, such as research or data processing;
an agent used by Whistler Blackcomb to evaluate the individual's creditworthiness or to collect the individual's account;
a credit reporting agency;
a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable judgment of Whistler Blackcomb, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information;
another entity as part of a merger, a sale of assets or all or part of a business, or any other corporate change or re-organization;
a third party or parties, where the individual consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required or permitted by law.
When you book certain services through us, such as accommodation, transportation, other travel-related services, tours, program, events and other services provided by third parties, Whistler Blackcomb will provide to the third party supplier that portion of an individual’s personal information that is necessary for the successful fulfillment and servicing of the individual’s booking.  Whistler Blackcomb may also engage third party service providers for the purpose of providing services or processing information on behalf of Whistler Blackcomb, and we may disclose personal information to such parties in connection with such purposes. Some third party suppliers and service providers may be located in other jurisdictions, and information in their custody (i) may or may not be subject to privacy legislation similar to that applicable to Whistler Blackcomb, and (ii) may be subject to laws applicable in such jurisdictions that permit access to such information by foreign governments or law enforcement agencies or by others.

SAFEGUARDS
Whistler Blackcomb understands the importance of using security safeguards to protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction.  Whistler Blackcomb employs physical, administrative and technological measure to protect personal information regardless of the format in which it is held and in accordance with the sensitivity of the information.  Whistler Blackcomb also takes measures to protect personal information disclosed to third parties, for example by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used.

In certain situations permitted or required by law, Whistler Blackcomb may not be able to provide access to all the personal information that it holds about an individual.
