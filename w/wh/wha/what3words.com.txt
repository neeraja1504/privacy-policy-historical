2. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
In certain jurisdictions, such as those located within the European Union, we are required to establish legal bases to process your personal data. We have identified our legal basis for processing in respect of each of the processing activities set out below:
(A) Responding to correspondence instigated by you
Where you contact us for any reason, we will process any personal data provided by you for the purposes set out under Section 1(A) above. On balance, we consider that we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data for those limited purposes, and that it is necessary to do so.

**  (C) ** Effectively manage our business and improve our services
Where we have determined that, on balance, our legitimate interest in using your personal data to effectively manage our business and improve our services does not outweigh your own rights and freedoms we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing that personal data. This covers the analysis of the information collected through technical means, as set out under Section 1(B) above.
