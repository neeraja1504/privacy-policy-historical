This Privacy Policy describes Fox's collection, use and sharing of personal information about users (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that personal information is not otherwise publicly available on the Site. This Privacy Policy also describes generally Fox's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics, or Site usage) to the extent such non-personally identifiable information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including visitors (users who use some of the Fox Services without being registered with Fox), "Members" (users who have registered with Fox) and "Subscribers" (Members who have purchased a Premium Subscription or registered for a newsletter).

Site Collected Information
Site Activity Information. When users visit the Site, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology including cookies), which are small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.
Third parties that support the Site by serving advertisements or providing Fox Services, such as allowing users to share content, view premium content, participate in Fantasy Games or post to the forums or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Fox does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers.
