The user’s Facebook and Twitter account information will only be utilized to post an image or video to the user’s account as requested by the user.

Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.

This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by WUC and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

ADVERTISERS:
WUC allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the WUC Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the WUC Service and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.
WUC does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks WUC to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. WUC reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and WUC may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
