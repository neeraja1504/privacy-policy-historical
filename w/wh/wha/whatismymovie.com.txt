This company do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your purchase.
We use personal data to develop our service:
When the training of the face detector has been done in an anonymity-preserving manner, by showing non-identified face images of thousands of persons to the neural network, this data is not possible to revert back to the persons. Instead, the neural network uses the data to construct a model that enables the face detector to decide whether the pattern in the image is a real face or is it, for example, a face-like shape burnt on the surface of a slice of toast.
5. Do We Transfer Personal Data Outside EU or EEA?
We may store and process your personal data in any country where we have facilities, employees, and/or service providers. Such countries may include the United States and other countries outside the European Union. Such transfers will be carried out in compliance with applicable regulations such as model contractual clauses or binding corporate rules.

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit personal data via the Services, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect more sensitive personal data, such as credit card data, information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.
While we use encryption to protect personal data transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
We store the data as long as it is necessary for the purpose of processing the data. For example, personal data in the customer and marketing register is erased period related to a specific customer relationship or service has elapsed or the data related to marketing activities has been identified as outdated or unresponsive.
