Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, and we do not distribute or share IP information with any third parties.
Cookies
Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. WhaleWisdom.com may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Service. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
How we may contact you
WhaleWisdom.com may send you information related to your account or services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
Updating your information
You can terminate your account at any time, by sending an email to admin@whalewisdom.com requesting your account be deleted. We typically deactivate accounts within two business days of such requests. You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination of your account
Security
WhaleWisdom.com is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.
We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
WhaleWisdom.com services and data utilize Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) servers and Amazon Simple Email Services (SES). Both these services have a robust security policy. More information regarding Amazon EC2 and Amazon SES security and privacy policies can be found at http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and http://aws.amazon.com/ses/, respectively.
Third-Party Online Advertising
We may use third parties who collect Information about Site Visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. These third parties include advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different Websites. Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient. One way we do so is by allowing the advertising networks with whom we work to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Sites. When the individual visits a third-party website on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individual's interest in WhaleWisdom and deliver one of our advertisements.
You may generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative.

If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide us with your personal identifiable information.
If you are under the age of 16 (EU & elsewhere), please ask your parent/guardian for their consent before submitting your personal information to this site.
If you have any reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 or 16 has provided us with his or her personal identifiable information, please contact us immediately for removal of that information from our databases.
