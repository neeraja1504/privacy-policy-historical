Sharing Personal Information
Information about you is shared with others
Our affiliates may share personal information among themselves. In addition, we may share personal information with other entities, including in the following circumstances:
Service Providers: We may share your personal information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (such as to host websites and mobile applications, manage databases, perform analyses, send communications for us, or provide certain other components of websites, mobile applications, or mobile alerts). We do not authorize service providers to use or disclose the information, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf. In such cases, collection and use of your personal information will be subject to their own privacy notice and practices, but we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Notice to the extent it comes into our possession for processing.

For instance, we may use analytics tools provided by Google to help us understand how people use the Services. You can learn more about how Google collects and uses information as a part of its tools at http://www.google.com/analytics/ .
Affiliate Program: We have an affiliate program in which third parties may refer customers to us for compensation. When you click a link to our site that is posted by an affiliate, or make a purchase through that affiliate, customer information related to those transactions will be shared with that affiliate.
Marketing & Promotions: We may share your personal information with select third parties for their marketing purposes. We describe below how you may choose to instruct us not to share personal information about you with our marketing partners.
Ads & Direct Mail: We may contract with third party vendors to provide ads to our customers on our behalf via the Internet or to send direct mail to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. In order to do so, such vendor may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website using a cookie and may then pool the anonymous information collected from our website with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail. To opt-out of receiving our direct mail or catalogs, you may email us at support@wholetones.com or call us at 855-400-2278.

Protection of Wholetones and Others: We may disclose your personal information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or violation of our Terms of Use or other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Legal Obligations: We may disclose your personal information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process in response to a request for cooperation from a court, law enforcement, or other government agency, and to comply with our other legal obligations.
Other Circumstances: We may disclose your personal information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
Information Security
Your entire credit or debit card number is sent to the appropriate credit card company or bank during order processing, but we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to help protect transmissions of your payment card data over the Internet. You can confirm that SSL is in use by looking at the URL line of your browser—the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.” If you are using a browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you may not be able to make purchases on our Web site.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information. If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the Internet, you should contact us at support@wholetones.com or using the toll-free number listed on the Site.
Third Party Services
Our Services may provide links to websites or mobile applications operated by third parties for your convenience and information. Websites and mobile applications operated by third parties may also refer you to the Services and use cookies or other technologies to track your usage. All of these websites and applications operate independently from us, and we do not control their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party websites and applications that you use to better understand their privacy practices. Likewise, other than our service providers (which operate under contract with us), we do not control the privacy practices of any third parties with which we share personal information as described in this Privacy Notice.
