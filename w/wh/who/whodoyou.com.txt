What information we collect and how we use it
Personal Information
For both Personal and Service Provider Accounts: We may use your email address to send you notifications, WhoDoYou newsletters, other updates, and to contact you both ourselves, and on behalf of other users (such as other users who send you messages or respond to a question you posted.) If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided on every email communication. We use the email address that you set in your contact info on Facebook. To change this at anytime please click on the update info tab on your Facebook profile and edit your contact info.
We use your current location as recorded in Facebook to calculate and display the distance that a local service provider's range of service is from your location and to provide you with public recommendations from others in your neighborhood according to your current location.
When you log in with Facebook, we use your social graph from Facebook to differentiate and sort results - we always show you first, reviews written by your Facebook friends, and after that, reviews written by other users, followed by Facebook posts, i.e. recommendations.
When you log in with Facebook we search posts and comments from your friends and groups and attempt to identify posts related to local business recommendations. Any recommendations located within your network and not tagged explicitly as public will stay within your network. we'll never share this private information.
For Service Providers only: We may use your email address and phone numbers to send you notifications and updates both ourselves, and on behalf of other users (such as other users who send you text or voice messages) and for activity relating to your Provider Account (such as when users review or recommend your business or when a user posts a question related to your service expertise). We may use your business phone and mobile phone numbers to notify you of activity on your profile page, and/or to deliver a message to such effect via a phone call, text or voice messages. We may also use your mobile phone number to notify and, in some cases, deliver to you via SMS, text or voice messages sent to you by other users. We use your business address to: (a) calculate and display the distance your business location is from the location of users; and (b) display a map of the location of your business. We may use your phone number to call you to verify that you are the owner or authorized representative of a business.
You may choose not to receive e-mail (and for Service Provider Accounts, SMS text messages and phone calls) of these types by emailing us at providers@whodoyou.com.
Provider profile data. Provider profile data is entered into our system primarily by end users, but occasionally we merge listings from other partners or sites. At this time, you cannot edit your profile information directly unless you claim your listing, and pay the monthly or annual provider fee. This is to ensure information is not improperly modified or unintentionally changed.
