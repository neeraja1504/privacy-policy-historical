Personal Information Collected
Metro collects PII through its digital services only if you choose to provide it to us when using products and services offered. We use this information only for fulfilling your requests. We do not lease or sell your PII to outside companies. However, Metro does contract with third parties to provide you with some of the services you may request online. In order to fulfill your request, Metro may provide your PII to such contractors.
Information collected is owned by Metro and may be used to communicate with you and improve the quality and personalization of your service. PII is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and Metro will not sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from Metro's digital services for commercial marketing purposes.
If you do not supply PII for one of the purposes listed above, we make no attempt to identify you individually. Rather, we may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This information is not linked to any PII that can identify any individual person.
Metro may also use PII to provide you with Metro-related information, for example, email about upcoming events and promotions. You have the right to opt out of any service or information you receive via a single Web or email command. Instructions for doing this are included in all Metro communications.

The internet, however, is not generally a secure medium of communication and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you input via Metro's digital services or send to us via the internet.
In addition, we may be required to release PII if it is subpoenaed by a court or grand jury. We may also provide statistics based on the information automatically collected from your visit to federal, state, and city officials.
