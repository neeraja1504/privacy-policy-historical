Privacy Policy | World Science Festival
INTRODUCTION
World Science Foundation, d/b/a World Science Festival (referred to collectively in this policy as “WSF,” “we” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization. Through the website(s) operated at the worldsciencefestival.com (the “Sites”), an annual festival, and other programs, WSF seeks to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future. Sometimes that means obtaining and utilizing, in certain specified ways, personal information from the users of our Sites. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the personal information we collect about you through the Sites, regardless of media platform (e.g., computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.). (Please note that World Science Festival may operate other websites, including worldscienceu.com, which have their own separate privacy policies that are not applicable here.) Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy is designed to make clear our intentions and approach to the collection and use of personal information in connection with our Sites and the choices you have. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please reach out to us at info@worldsciencefestival.com.
CONSENT
By using the Sites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Sites. Specifically, by submitting any Personal Information (as defined below in “Information We Collect & How We Collect It”) to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose that Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and as permitted or required by law. You have the option of refraining from submitting Personal Information and reviewing, updating and deleting Personal Information you have submitted (by contacting info@worldsciencefestival.com), and can limit your use of the Sites to those aspects that do not require Personal Information if you do not agree with our practices outlined in this Privacy Policy regarding Personal Information.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE COLLECT IT
For the purposes of operating, improving, and monitoring the user experience on our Sites and World Science Festival operations generally, we collect various information from those using the Sites. This information is broadly of two types: Personal Information (meaning information which is personal to you and can be used to identify you, like your name and email address) and General Information (meaning information which cannot be used to identify you, like the number of users—but not their names—who have viewed an article).
General Information & Cookies
You can access content on our Sites and use most feature of our Sites without revealing any Personal Information. In these cases we may collect General Information including, but not limited to, pages visited, hyperlinks used, type of device used, and time on Sites. Collecting such General Information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by individual site visitors, and from such information a user’s Internet Service Provider, geographic location, and other data could be inferred, but nothing which can be used to personally identify you. We use this information to understand how to service users of our Sites and improve our Sites and programs. We do this through Google Analytics or other site analysis tools.
We may also use cookies to store and help track information about you to provide you with a customized and personal service (e.g., to keep track of where you are in a particular course and how you have performed on problems).
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and we assume that if you do not disable cookies you consent to use of them by us and by Google Analytics. Most browsers offer easy instructions on setting your browser to reject Google cookies or cookies in general. You may choose to do so at any time, but please note that various personalized functions and benefits of the Sites may not work properly if you reject our cookies.
Personal Information
We only collect Personal Information when you provide it to us directly, for example:
• If you register with us to receive newsletters or other communications from us.
• If you contact us.
• If you donate to us.
• If you purchase tickets to a WSF event via our Sites.
• If you volunteer.
• If you add yourself to a waitlist.
• If you post comments. WSF offers some interactive features on our Sites, such as the ability to comment on content. If you post Personal Information in comments, we may also collect that information.
A NOTE ABOUT COMMENT FEATURES ON OUR SITE AND OTHER WSF FORUMS
WSF uses a technology called livefyre to transfer and post on our Sites comments originally posted on the WSF Facebook page or other WSF social media forums, including, without limitation, LinkedIn and Twitter (collectively, “WSF Forums”). Therefore, if you post comments on the WSF Facebook page or other WSF Forums, those comments, and any Personal Information associated with these comments, may appear on our Sites and may be collected by us. (Additional information about livefyre is available at http://web.livefyre.com.)
HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We use Personal Information we collect on our Sites as described below.
Donations
WSF collects donations via the Sites through a third party, Patron Manager. When you make an online donation to WSF, you will be directed to the Patron Manager website and you will be asked to provide Personal Information to complete the transaction.

Patron Manager will not provide us with your credit card information, but they will give us your name and contact information, which we may use in the future to contact you.
Ticket Purchases
WSF may sell tickets on our Sites through third party ticketing agents. When you purchase tickets via the Sites, WSF and its third party ticketing agent will request information necessary to process your ticket purchase, which will include Personal Information. In order to complete the purchase, you will be transferred to the ticketing agent’s website and you will be governed by their own independent privacy policy. The ticketing agent will not share your credit card information with us, but they will give us your name and contact information, which we may share with production partners and/or use in the future to contact you.

You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information you submit to WSF. Submitting inaccurate information, or failing to maintain the accuracy of information that changes (for example, a change of email address) may disrupt your ability to use receive newsletters, may affect the information you receive from us, and may impact our ability to contact you.

WSF may occasionally provide links to sites operated by outside parties (“Third Party Sites”) that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Sites without obtaining your consent. In addition, from our Sites you may be able to interact with social media sites (“Social Media Platforms”), for example, by “liking” us on Facebook. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party Sites or chose to interact with or through a Social Media Platform, your activities are not governed by this Privacy Policy and will be governed by the privacy policy on that Third Party Site or Social Media Platform.

We may also maintain a WSF page on Facebook or other WSF Forum (as defined in “A Note about Comment Features on Our Sites and WSF Forums” above). Those pages and your interaction with them are governed by the privacy policies of Facebook or other relevant WSF Forum site and not our Privacy Policy. We may, however, use livefyre to automatically or selectively post comments from WSF Forums on our Sites. As with other Third Party Sites, WSF expressly does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of WSF Forums, although we may have a presence on them.

To that end, WSF uses industry standard security practices to keep your Personal Information private, and to protect it from disclosure to or access by third parties. We will not share it with third parties, except as directed by you or as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
