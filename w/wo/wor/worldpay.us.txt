You may be able to improve your experience on our Website when you tell us who you are – for example, by signing up for e-mail or newsletters, applying for products, making inquiries, or requesting further information about a product or service.
Some of the information you may submit is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person. Examples include your name, phone number, address, and social security number. It is possible to browse our Website without actively submitting any personally identifiable information.
We or our third-party service providers may use this information for a number of purposes, for example, to better service your requests and/or inquiries, monitor Website usage and/or performance, improve the customer experience of our Website, ensure technological compatibility with your computer, protect against fraud or identity theft, or conduct aggregate analyses on usage patterns.
