TrafficSwarm Privacy Policy
TrafficSwarm.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy.
Please read the following to learn more about our information gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.
IP Addresses
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our web server, and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address, should you decide to create a TrafficSwarm account, is also used to prevent you from registering twice due to temporary technical problems.
Cookies
Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however, in no way does this tell us who you are. TrafficSwarm.com has two primary uses for its cookies.
First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may be presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested in a particular offer. We also use cookies to help track referring web sites.
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
