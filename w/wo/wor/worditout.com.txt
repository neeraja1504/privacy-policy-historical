Privacy and Cookie Policy – WordItOut
Your privacy is very important to us. That’s why we have considered how to collect only necessary information, protect that data and give you control over it.
This Privacy and Cookie Policy explains these details and more, which applies to any information you provide to us. We encourage you to inform yourself and read this document carefully.
If you’re under 16, make sure you’ve asked an adult (over 18) you trust to have a look at this with you.
Information we collect
There are 2 types of information that we may collect. Each contains several categories of data which we simply identify here and will discuss in more detail below.
Personal data
Personal data is any information that could be used (directly or indirectly) to identify you, or any individual.
Account profile : When you save your User Content, we require your email address.
Correspondence : Sometimes when you contact us, either communicating by email or using an online contact form, we will receive your email address.
Blacklists : You may give us your email address to prevent it from being used on the Website.
Online identifiers : Unique identifiers may be assigned to you for security reasons, usage analysis and sometimes to personalise content.
Technical identifiers : We automatically receive and save certain types of information whenever you interact with this Website. Examples of personal data we may collect include your IP address; the kind of browser or device you use.
Most of this document refers to your personal data.
Non-personal data
Any other information we may collect would be non-personal data.
User Content : When you save or modify word clouds, we collect your User Content. For word clouds, we do not collect the original text used to generate a word cloud.

Personal data in User Content
Please remember that as described in our Terms, you may not put another person’s personal data in your User Content (unless they give you permission). If your personal data is shared in User Content and you have not given permission, please try to contact the person who created the Content or contact us with the form below. You should exercise caution before deciding to disclose voluntarily your own personal data in User Content that can be viewed by the public.
Children’s data
We do not wish to or knowingly collect or store any personal data from people under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not save your word clouds or send your email address to us. Please see how you can protect other personal data below (for example, with private browser settings).
Why we need your personal data
We only collect personal data when it is necessary, and justify why it is necessary below. If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA), we have identified the lawful basis for processing your personal data ( Legitimate interest, Legal obligation, Consent ).
Account profile
On saving a word cloud, we require your email address so that we can identify who created the User Content.
Legitimate interest : We may have to contact you to provide you with our service and send links in order to to manage your User Content or to notify you that a particular service you use has been changed or suspended.
Legal obligation : We may need to contact you if you have violated our Terms or any other law.
Correspondence
Any personal information you disclose to us through correspondence is needed in order to respond to you about our services.
Legitimate interest : We may have to contact you to answer (e.g. a support question) or use your data to find your User Content.
Legal obligation : We may need to process this data for legal reasons e.g. if correspondence relates to legal issues.
Blacklist
If you want us to block your email address from being used on the Website, we need to store it on a blacklist.
Legitimate interest : We cannot block your email address if we do not store it. We may block certain email addresses that breach our Terms.
Online identifiers
Online identifiers may be used to identify whether a visitor to the Website is security threat or not. They may also be used to identify a visitor to compile aggregated Website usage statistics. An identifier may be used to provide you with personalised ads.
Legitimate interest : Without such security measures, our Website would be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Usage analytics enable us to correctly manage, maintain and improve the Website.
Consent : If you live inside the EEA, your ads will only be personalised with your explicit consent.
Technical identifiers
We may use technical identifiers to resolve security issues, to troubleshoot technical problems or to analyse Website usage.
Legitimate interest : We need this data to continue providing our services in case of any issues or threats.
Sharing your data
Our Website is designed to never share any of your personal data publicly.
We will not sell, trade or rent personal data to third parties. We do not buy personal data from third parties nor obtain it from publicly accessible sources.
Trusted third parties
We use a few, trusted third parties to provide, improve, or protect our services. They only have access to the personal data they need to perform these tasks on our behalf. We require that they use your information only for the purposes we’ve authorised and that they protect your personal information to the same standards we do (or better).
The third parties who provide services and may process your personal data are:
Infrastructure : suppliers include all our web hosting, database storage, email servers and network providers.
Google Analytics : anonymous, aggregated analysis of how this Website is used.
Advertisers : Google Adsense helps support this Website so we can provide you services for free.
Widgets : AddToAny enables you to share content on third party websites.
Legal reasons
We do reserve the right to share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with the law or law enforcement, or to protect the legal rights, property, or the safety of Enideo, you or another individual.
Business transaction
We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business. In this situation, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to a third party where this Privacy and Cookie Policy may no longer apply.
Non-personal data
We may share some of your non-personal data and reserve the right to share personal data that’s aggregated and anonymised in a way that doesn’t identify you.
Some Content is limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess this URL address. We also monitor and try to block automated requests to such pages, to prevent any unauthorised access. However, because these web pages are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorised third party could discover them.
You should send or share these links only to people authorised to view such Content. If you are using a shared device, we recommend that you delete your web browsing history.
For the protection of your privacy, we do not put personal data on any such Content.
Links to other websites
Please note that this Website contains links to other websites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those sites; they may differ from this document. We have no control over and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for the content, privacy policies or practices of such third party websites.
Keeping your data secure
We are committed to protecting personal data. We keep your personal data secure by following industry-standard technical and organisational practices. However, please note that no system is ever completely secure and we cannot guarantee this. By using our Website, you accept the inherent risks of providing information online.
Countries your data may enter
Personal data may be transferred to and processed in a country outside of your own, ours (the United Kingdom) or the EEA. In such instances we will use appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy and applicable legislation.
How long we keep your personal data
We will only hold your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this policy or for legal reasons (as required or permitted by law). Even if we remove your personal data it may persist on back-up or archival media for a longer period.
Please note that details on how to change or remove your data are given below.
