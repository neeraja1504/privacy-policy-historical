However, Customers may at any time, notify us that they do not wish to receive this material via an "opt-out" facility contained on our websites.
If a Customer no longer wants us to keep a record of their personal information or they need to update some of the particulars (for example, address), the Customer may contact us by emailing our Customer Support Group at customercare@roar.com, so we can update or remove the information as required.

Many improvements and updates to our websites are based on such data as the total number of Visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide products and services that are better tailored to our Customers and Visitors needs.
