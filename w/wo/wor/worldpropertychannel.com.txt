The advertising companies may also receive some anonymous information about ad viewing by Internet users on WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites and other Internet sites. This information may be associated with a customer's web browser, but cannot be associated with a name or e-mail address without the customer's permission. (This means that advertising companies may know where your computer goes on the Internet, but they don't know who you are unless you tell them.)

WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ is not responsible for these other websites, it is up to the User to read their privacy policies, and choose whether to let them collect information about what you do on the Internet. Please note that if an advertiser asks WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but no? any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
