How You Can Access, Limit or Change the Information Collected About You
Security
CallingCards.com uses the high security standard encryption (SSL) to encrypt all of your credit card information while it is in transit to us. All data stored on the CallingCards.com server is protected by a secure "firewall" so that no unauthorized use or activity can take place. Although CallingCards.com will make every effort to safeguard your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk that thieves may find a way to thwart our security system that transmissions over the Internet will be intercepted. Our liability to you in the event of a security breach by a third party is limited by the terms of our User Agreement.
Amendments to Our Privacy Policy
We may, from time to time, amend our Privacy Policy. If we do, then we will post such amendments to this document so that you may always have access to our most recent policy. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. If at any point we decide to disclose personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. You will be given the choice at that time to "opt-out" of any disclosures of your personal information that you made available to us prior to the change in our policy.
Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
CallingCards.com has put in place policies to protect certain customer proprietary network information ("CPNI") that may come into the possession of CallingCards.com during the course of normal business operations.
CPNI includes the types of telecommunications services purchased, how these telecommunications services are used, and related billing information for those services. CPNI also typically includes the type of information found on bills, such as call details and the types of local, long distance and wireless telecommunications services that have been purchased. CPNI does not include telephone numbers and the associated names and addresses.
Carriers have a duty, and customers have a right, to protect CPNI under federal law. While CallingCards.com is not a carrier, CallingCards.com is governed by confidentiality agreements with its carriers. Accordingly, CallingCards.com does not sell, trade, or share our customers' CPNI with unaffiliated third-parties or with anyone not authorized to represent CallingCards.com without express permission, or as may be required by law.
CallingCards.com does utilize CPNI when providing customer service for its customers and as otherwise allowed by law and its contracts with the carriers. Carriers are permitted to use or disclose CPNI when offering telecommunications services of the same type that a customer has already purchased from us. CallingCards.com may also use or disclose a customer's CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons such as a court order, to investigate fraud or to protect against the unlawful use of the company's telecommunications network and services.
Use of CPNI
CPNI is collected and maintained in the normal course of providing telecommunications services. This information allows companies to provide higher quality service and suggest better products to best suit a customer's needs. CPNI also allows company representatives to offer promotions, packaged deals, and targeted discounts and special offers to help customers save time and money.
CallingCards.com fully abides by all federal and state law governing CPNI disclosure. Accordingly, CallingCards.com does not sell or release any CPNI to unaffiliated third parties.
CallingCards.com may share or release CPNI information to third parties upon receiving lawful and express consent from customers. If a customer opts-in, CallingCards.com may release CPNI to authorized agents for the sole purpose of allowing these agents to act on our behalf. This may include selling, marketing, or providing customers with more information about related products and services. All authorized agents who receive CPNI are bound by confidentiality agreements, and may not release, disclose, or sell customer information.
Restricting Use of CPNI
Any approval or denial of approval for the use of CPNI outside of the service to which the customer already subscribes is valid until the customer affirmatively revokes or limits such approval or denial. Restricting CPNI usage will not affect the provision of any services to which the customer subscribes. Customers can contact the CallingCards.com service representatives at the CallingCards.com customer service number or the representatives of the carriers at the numbers listed on the calling cards to modify the use of their CPNI. Customers may also contact the CallingCards.com or carrier representatives with any questions regarding the use and disclosure of CPNI.
