Privacy and data notice
Providing a service for teachers and students with digital technology at the heart of everything we do, online safety for our customers is paramount, especially since children also use our product. Visual Education Ltd, makers of Wordwall.net, comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.
Who owns your data?
When you use the Wordwall.net site, you own and control your data, including data relating to your students. We do not ask students directly for their data, but users may do so, for example, through the setting of assignments and the creation of activity leaderboards. You should ask for permission before you collect this data and delete it when appropriate to do so.
We licence Wordwall to both schools and individual teachers. We do not licence Wordwall to students and require credit card details and/or a school purchase order to subscribe to our service.
We consider the data controller and owner to be the individual user (e.g. a teacher) rather than any corporate body that might employ the individual (e.g. a school). Therefore we will not grant access to data made on behalf of individuals, unless the corporate body have contracted with us for the provision of the service (e.g. under a whole-school site subscription service).
Your data
Wordwall.net provides a personalised experience for teachers to use our site.
We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone to keep your data secure. We will never ask you for your password when contacting you by phone or email. Wordwall.net automatically logs users out after one hour of inactivity if they are logged in as an individual user. When you have finished using Wordwall.net, we recommend that you log out. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library.
Data Backup
Wordwall.net’s backup procedure allows for storage of up to 35 days.
Visual Education collects the following data and stores it securely:
Teacher users
Wordwall.net enables teachers to create and set up their own account. This allows teachers to create their own resources, share them with other teachers (giving us a licence to use the resource) and assign them to students. We ask teacher users for their title, first name, last name, email address, username and password, with the collection of their role and subject interests as optional. We may also collect financial information, including credit card information, for the processing of subscriptions.
At all times, within the definition of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the user (teacher or school) retain the status of Data Controller for the data stored on our cloud service. The data obtained from the students always remains in the ownership of the school, or that of the individual teacher users.
Students
We do not provide user accounts to students or ask them to provide us with their contact details.
Wordwall.net’s assignment and leaderboard tools, allow the collection of a student data:
- users may set assignments that collect the student’s name and response to questions
- user-created activities may include leaderboards which collect the student’s name and score
Users should ensure that in collecting such information they have obtained permission from whoever is completing the assignment or leaderboard-based activity (and if necessary, parental permission).
