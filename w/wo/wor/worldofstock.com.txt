Overview
Many web sites today collect information about their customers and this information can be used for a variety of purposes, some of which may be done without the customers explicit permission. As fellow citizens of the world wide web, we take this very seriously. Within this website there are several areas where you may need to enter information in order to complete orders and transactions and/or simplify your browsing and ordering experience.
We take our customers concerns about privacy and security very seriously and therefore we fully disclose what information is gathered and what it is used for. You can be assured that the information you provide is only used for legitimate reasons and we have taken steps to safeguard this information.
Security of your Personal and Financial Information
When submitting payment for an order, the payment processing is done by a reputable, third party supplier with a proven track record and excellent security and anti-fraud protection. Your credit card details are never sent through e-mail and we never see them, unless you provide this to us over the phone. They are not kept on our database. We collect them only in order to process payment.
All transactions involving financial or sensitive information is done over encrypted pages using industry standard 128 bit SSL certificate.
To know whether the page you are on is secure look for the 'closed padlock' icon on the bottom of your browser. Double clicking this icon will give you information about the certificate and its validity.
None of your personal information, such as phone number, email, address etc is kept on our server, although we may add you to our mailing list for future updates, should you wish.
The exception to this is if you setup an account with us and decide to keep this information on file voluntarily. In this case your credit card number is encrypted with a unique key that can only be accessed by account holders
