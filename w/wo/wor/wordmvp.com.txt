IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. For each visitor to this website, the web server recognizes your IP address and the pages you request from it. This is part of the normal functioning of every web server, and necessary for it to return the pages you request. This information is not normally retained for longer than a few milliseconds.
I do not normally run web server logging. However I might occasionally enable it for maintenance purposes, for a few hours or days. If I did, the above information might be written to a log file, which would then be automatically deleted at the end of the day or the end of the week.

What are cookies?
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. A cookie cannot contain any harmful code.
A cookie can be used to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

How to control cookies

You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
