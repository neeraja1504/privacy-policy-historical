§ 3 Principles of data processing
The term personal data refers to all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. It includes, for instance, information such as your name, age, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, IP address and user behavior. Information that does not allow us to establish a connection to you as a person (or would only allow such a connection with an unreasonable amount of effort), for instance anonymized information, is not classed as personal data. Processing personal data (for instance collecting, querying, using, storing and transferring personal data) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal data is deleted as soon as the purpose for which it was collected is fulfilled and statutory retention periods no longer apply.
Insofar as we process your personal data in order to provide specific services to you, the following serves to inform you of the concrete processes, the scope and the purpose of data processing, the legislation on which it is based and the duration of storage in each case.

§ 7 Tracking and analysis tools
We use tracking and analysis tools to ensure our website is continuously optimized and its design is suitable for its purpose.

These interests justify the use of tracking and analysis tools described below in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 p. 1 (f) GDPR. If you have granted your consent to the use of cookies in response to a notice (“cookie banner”) on the website, then lawfulness is also based on Art. 6 Para. 1 p. 1 (a) GDPR. The purpose of tracking and analysis tools and the data they process can also be referenced from the following descriptions. You can use our website’s cookie settings to activate and deactivate your selection of tracking and analysis tools at any time.
1. Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountainview, CA 94043 USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website.
The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website, for instance the time, location and frequency of your visits, is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. The collection of other personal data in addition to your IP address by the cookies set by Google Analytics cannot be ruled out when Google Analytics is used. Please note that Google may disclose this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if a third party processes the information on behalf of Google.
Google will use this information on behalf of the website operator for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website and internet usage to the website operator. According to Google, Google will not associate the IP address transferred by your browser within the context of Google Analytics with any other data held by Google.
You can prevent the storage of cookies on your computer by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. Please note, however, that you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in full if you do so.
The collection of other personal data in addition to your IP address by the cookies set by Google Analytics cannot be ruled out. In addition to deactivating tracking cookies as described in the preceding, you can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting information about your use of the website and transferring it to Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
This plug-in prevents information about your visit to the website from being sent to Google Analytics. The plug-in does not prevent any other form of analysis.
This website uses Google Analytics with the “anonymizeIp” extension to ensure the best possible protection of your personal data. The code deletes the last 8 bits of IP addresses so that your IP address is anonymized when it is collected (so-called IP masking). Google truncates and therefore anonymizes IP addresses in Member States of the European Union as well as in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before they are sent to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to and truncated by a Google server in the USA.
2. Google AdWords
We use “Google AdWords” technology in general and, in particular, conversion tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Clicking on an advertisement placed by Google will install a conversion tracking cookie on your computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days and are not used for personal identification purposes. If you visit certain pages of our website while the cookie is still active, both Google and we can recognize that you clicked on a specific advertisement and were subsequently transferred to this website. Every Google AdWords customer is given a different cookie. It is therefore impossible to track cookies via the websites of AdWords customers.
The data collected by conversion cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. Customers receive information on the number of users who clicked on their advertisement and were subsequently transferred to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified.
If you do not want to participate in conversion tracking, you can prevent this by adjusting your browser’s settings accordingly so that, for instance, setting cookies is generally prohibited. You can also deactivate conversion tracking cookies by adjusting your browser so that only cookies from “googleadservices.com” are blocked.
3. B2B Media
This offer uses Selfcampaign, a service to implement adverts by B2B Media Group EMEA GmbH (“B2BMG”). B2BMG uses so-called Cookies, a textfile which is stored in the browser of the computer and collects/contains anonymized usage data. Selfcampaign also uses so-called Web Beacons (invisible images). Through these Web Beacons information such as user traffic on the pages of this offer can be analyzed. The information obtained through Cookies and Web Beacons about the usage of this website and delivery of ad contents are transferred to a server of B2BMG in Germany and stored there. This information may be passed on by B2BMG to their contractual partners. This data can be used to create usage profiles under a pseudonym. No personal identifiable information is collected without consent of the affected person. B2BMG uses this data to analyze usage of the website by visitors and for usage based online advertisements (OBA). As far as IP-addresses are collected, these are stored anonymously by deletion of the last number block. The cookies are either from B2BMG Cookies or by providers used by B2BMG who are also pledged to privacy, including kruxdigital Inc., Google Inc. Furthermore Selfcampaign uses different functionalities of TradeDesk (https://www.thetradedesk.com/general/privacy-policy) and AdEx (http://www.theadex.com/#privacy) and is technically connected to these services. You can prevent the installation of cookies through a setting in your browser; however please note that you might not be able to use all functions of our offer. In addition you can at any time exercise your rights to correction or deletion or limitation of processing or your right to revoke against the processing as well as the right for data portability.

§ 8 Hyperlinks
Our website contains so-called hyperlinks to websites operated by other providers. Activating a hyperlink will transfer you directly to the website of the corresponding provider. You can recognize the transfer by the change of URL, for example. We cannot accept any liability for the confidential use of your data on these websites as we have no influence on the compliance of these companies with data protection regulations. Please refer directly to the website concerned to obtain information on how your personal data is handled.

Pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR, you have a right to restrict our use of your personal data if you contest the accuracy of the data; the processing is unlawful; we no longer need the personal data, but it is required by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Your right pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR remains unaffected if you have lodged an objection to data processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.

§ 13 Data safety and security measures
We undertake to protect your privacy and to treat your personal data confidentially. We have implemented extensive technological and organizational measures to prevent the manipulation, loss or misuse of your personal data stored on our servers. These measures are routinely reviewed and adapted to reflect technological developments. They include the use of acknowledged encryption methods (SSL or TLS).
Please note, however, that the structure of the internet makes it possible for persons and institutions outside of our sphere of control to disregard data protection regulations and the security measures detailed in the preceding. In particular, data that is transmitted without prior encryption – for instance by email – can be read by third parties. We have no technological influence in this regard. It is the user’s responsibility to protect the data provided by them from misuse by way of encryption or other suitable means.
