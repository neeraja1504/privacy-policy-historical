Last updated 02/05/2013
WorkingFromHome.com (the or our “Web Site”) is owned and operated by Information Services Inc. The following Privacy Policy discloses Information Services Inc’s practices and policies regarding the gathering and dissemination of personal information.
Personal Information We Collect
If you register with us or if you make a purchase through our Web Site, we may collect certain personal information. That information may include:
your name, user name, address, phone number and email address;
credit card information whenever a purchase is made; and
account preferences.
This information may be collected and may be used for a number of purposes:
To establish and maintain a commercial relationship with you and to provide you with products and services. Personal contact and credit card information is required to process your purchases. Account information is retained by us to enable our website to identify you, to allow you to set up and access your account and download files which you have purchased. This information is used only for these purposes and is only retained in transaction records required for internal management and auditing purposes, unless you are informed otherwise or you provide your consent.
To understand your needs and preferences. We maintain a record of the products and services you receive from us, and we may ask you for additional information so that we can serve you better.
To provide you with information you have requested, and to keep you informed with respect to ongoing changes to our website. Your email address may be used to send you our newsletters and mailings.
To develop, enhance or provide new products and services. We may from time to time conduct surveys and research, requesting input from our visitors to help us improve our website, products and services in an effort to serve you better. Your participation in such surveys is voluntary, and in some cases you may have the option to participate anonymously. However, your name, address, email and telephone number may be required to take advantage of bonuses or other benefits which may be available to survey participants, in which case your contact information will only be used for notification and fulfillment purposes.
To manage and administer our business. The nature of the Internet is such that it passively and automatically collects certain information about a user’s traffic patterns, which may be linked to their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. These are unique Internet “addresses” assigned to all Web users by their Internet Service Providers (ISP). Server logs record statistical information, such as visitors’ IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, web pages requested, and identify visitors by categories such as domains and browser types. These statistics are only used on an aggregate basis and will not contain any information that could identify you personally.
To meet legal, regulatory, security and processing requirements (such as in response to a court order), and otherwise as permitted or required by law.
If we intend to use personal information for purposes not identified to you or as set out above, these other purposes will be described to you at the time of collection or before using the information. We will not use your information for any other purpose without your consent.
Cookies
Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of our Internet servers or through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are small text files containing a unique identification number that identifies your browser – but not you – to our servers each time you visit our website. Cookies are not pervasive or invasive programs that enter a user’s system and damage files. They simply tell us which pages of our website are visited and by how many visitors. Cookies cannot, by themselves, disclose the individual identity of any site user, and we never combine information gathered by a cookie with personally identifiable information like your name, telephone number or email address, without your consent.
You should be aware that WorkingFromHome.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for the Web Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that you may have to have cookies enabled in your browser if you wish to make a purchase on our website, log into your account or download files.
Third Parties’ Access to Information
Information Services Inc. is not in the business of selling customer information to others.

We may contract with third parties to fulfill certain functions on our behalf, such as providing marketing assistance, analyzing data, preparing and maintaining site content, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These agents may have access to customer information only as required in order to help them perform their functions on our behalf, but they are not allowed to use that information for any other purpose and must keep such information confidential.
We also may work with affiliates, and in some cases we offer services or sell goods and services jointly with these affiliates.
