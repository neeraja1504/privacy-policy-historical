Worldwide Brands Privacy Policy
Your Privacy is very important to us.
We do not collect personally identifiable information from our users, unless that information is necessary in order to complete a transaction, such as a sale of one of our products to a user of the Site. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, unless absolutely necessary in order to complete a sales transaction between our Site and yourself, that involves a third party. We do not share email or other contact information with other companies. When we find a resource or offer that we strongly believe you should be aware of to better serve your business success, we will contact you with that resource or offer ourselves. We have taken all reasonable and customary steps to ensure security of personally identifiable information. If and when we request private information from our users (such as credit card numbers), we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology) for transferring the data. This technology encrypts your data so it is impossible for anyone else to read it.
When you use our Site, the choices you make may provide information to us concerning your interests, and concerning the appeal of associated Site features. Information concerning our visitors' activities on our Site is known as Aggregate Information. This information does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially useful data concerning our users' preferences and the efficacy and interest of our Site's features. An example of Aggregate Information would be how many people visit our Home Page in a given month. The manner in which we collect Aggregate Information is explained below.
COOKIES
We collect Aggregate Information about the use of our Site through cookies and similar Internet technologies. "Cookies" are small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site, and to compile Aggregate data to improve the site. Cookies work as follows: a web site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates your computer with information stored at the site. Your browser places the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access that site on your computer, the site recognizes the cookie, makes the stored information available, and adds new information based on the present visit. Our cookies do not collect or retain your name or other personally identifying information. In addition, no third parties are permitted to use cookies created at our Site for their own purposes.
