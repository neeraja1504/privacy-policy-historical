Effective Date: 23 August 2010
(Last Updated 10 Outubro 2010)
Welcome to World War Online, a personal online service operated by Chilltime Lda. ("Chilltime") which consists of, among other things, software that you have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you have embedded on a web site or are about to embed (“Chilltime Games”), any applications created by Chilltime and available through social networking sites (“SNS Apps”), any software running on Chilltime's servers, (“Chilltime Software”), content, related documentation, information on the Chilltime domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Chilltime Software (collectively, the “Service”). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been made on the website www.Chilltime.com. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.
What We Collect
Chilltime gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:
When you register a profile with Chilltime, your profile including any information (name, address, gender) will be registered with Chilltime. When you identify yourself on a Chilltime site, you may identify yourself using a Chilltime account. When you identify yourself on a Chilltime site, you may identify yourself through a social network account in which Chilltime may receive additional information about your profile.
In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don't generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information” about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.), exception being for billing and payments where we store your billing information such as name, street address, phone number. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social networking systems on which you have used Chilltime Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in games. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and at your own discretion.
In specific cases we may provide links to your profile in your SNS, this will enable members to interact with you and improve your experience.
When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.
Note that since most Chilltime Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.
When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.
We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Chilltime games and other users of Chilltime, to supplement your profile.
Chilltime may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Chilltime.
You should also be aware that most content delivered through Chilltime games originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself.
Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Chilltime site or playing Chilltime games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”).
By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as Chilltime sees fit.
Children Under The Age Of 13
Chilltime does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Chilltime or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Chilltime. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@chilltime.com .

Third-Party Advertising Companies
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on certain Chilltime games and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party advertising technology uses information derived from Activity Information, Chilltime's cookies on your hard drive, your visits to our site, the Chilltime games that you view and the SNS Apps you use to target advertising within our site or Chilltime games or SNS Apps. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our site and other sites.

Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.
Chilltime does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Chilltime to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).
