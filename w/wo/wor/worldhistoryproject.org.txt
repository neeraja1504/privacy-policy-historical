Description of Service
World History Project is an online service that allows people to record, discover and share events in an open and public forum. The information about these events is generated by the users of World History Project. Our users create profiles which are shown to other users of World History Project. Some personal information we ask for is displayed to other users of World History Project. All events recorded by you, and all the descriptions, photos and other information submitted about those events are viewable by other World History Project users. See more on this topic below at "Correcting, Updating or Removing Information."
