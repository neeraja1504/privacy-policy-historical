PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to our website woolrich.eu (" Site "). We ask you to carefully read the Privacy Policy, which is valid both when you visit the site and simply surf or use its services without buying any products, as well as when you should visit the site and decide to buy one or more products. In addition, if you have not already done so, we ask you to read the terms of sale and the cookie policy of our website.
The site and all trademarks, products and any related statement or information are the exclusive property of Woolrich Europe S.p.A. , with its registered office in Via dell'Arcoveggio, 59/5 - 40129 Bologna, Italy - („ Woolrich “).
The site is managed by Arvato Services Italia S.r.l. , with its headquarters in Via Zanica, 19 - Grassobbio (BG) Italy - („ Arvato “).
1. Who manages your personal data
Woolrich is the "owner" of the data management of the users of the site, according to the lawful decree of 30 June 2003, n.196: § "Decreto Legislativo 30 giugno 2003, n. 196" („Privacy Code “) and European Regulation n. 2016/679 (“ Privacy Regulation ”); and therefore defines the purposes and modalities of the data management, and the means used to do so; this also applies to the security profile.
Arvato has been appointed "responsible" for data management in accordance with the Privacy Code and the Privacy Regulation, because of its experience, abilities, and reliability, and because it can guarantee to take full account of the existing rules on data protection, including the security profile of the data. The responsible company executes the data protection according to Woolrich's instructions. Woolrich periodically checks that the responsible company can solve the tasks that are handed over to it in a punctual manner, and that it can continue to guarantee the full respect of the existing rules for the protection of personal data.
Because Arvato carries out the invoicing to the users who purchase products on the website, and because Arvato is therefore exposed to specific legal obligations in the accounting and fiscal areas, Arvato is, in relation to the purchases made by the users of the site, and apart from the responsibility of the data management according to the previous paragraph, also a co-owner with regard to the data administration of the clients in the perspective of this fiscal and accounting area. In this function, it will collect and store your relevant personal information and be directly responsible to you for this type of protection of your personal data.
Woolrich and Arvato are thus co-owners of the data management of the web users solely in relation to fiscal and/or accounting purposes, and therefore agree on the modality of the data management and the means to be used for this (also with regard to the security profile).
2. Our Policy
We try to adhere to a principle of strict necessity concerning the administration of personal data. For this reason, we have designed the site and are using it in such a way that the use of your personal information is limited to a necessary minimum and that the use of your personal data is excluded if the purposes pursued are in some specific circumstances possible with only using anonymous data (such as, for example, market research for the improvement of services), or by other means which allow the identification of the interested party only in the case of strict necessity or at the request of competent authorities (such as, for example, the data relating to your IP address, or the internet traffic and your stay on the site
3. How and for what purposes your personal data will be used
Your personal data will be collected and managed by Woolrich, exclusively for purposes connected with the website, its services and the purchase of products. In terms of fiscal and/or accounting purposes, your personal data will be collected by Woolrich and Arvato as parties in charge of the data management.
Your personal data may also be used in other administrative operations, but always within the limits of the purposes described above.
In particular, your personal data may be used for the following purposes:
A. in the section of registration processes in the site, Woolrich collects and manages your personal data (such as your e-mail address, your characteristics, and your password) by the relevant "My Account" registration form to provide access services to reserved areas and services of woolrich.eu and to send you the newsletters via e-mail, if expressly requested;
B. in relation to customer care services (" ****Customer Care"), Woolrich collects and manages your personal data (such as, for example, your e-mail address and password) for purposes that are necessary to provide you with all information related to the services provided on the website and the purchase of products;
C. in the section of the purchasing process of products on the page, Woolrich and Arvato will collect and manage your personal data (such as your identification data, e-mail address, postal address, credit card number and bank details, telephone number) by the order form for the sale of the products. Specifically, Arvato will manage your personal data for administrative and accounting obligations, which are strictly linked to the purchase of products (e.g. management/processing of orders, invoice issuing, management of related information requests, securing and eventual reacquisition of the credit, etc.);
D. in the section of request from the customer service, Woolrich collects and manages your personal data to provide you with information about surfing problems, browser compatibility and visualization or loading the pages of the website;
E. in the section of creating a wish list, Woolrich collects and manages your data for purposes of personalizing the products on the page based on your purchase behaviour.
Your personal data is mostly digitally managed, and in some cases also in paper format, for example when managing your data is necessary to forestall fraudulent actions on the website (if you want to know whether the management of your data is done in paper format or digitally, just send a request to the e-mail address support_gb@woolrich.eu or to Woolrich, to the address of the previously mentioned company office; for fiscal and/or accounting matters, you can, however, send a request to Arvato to the address of the above mentioned company headquarters). Your personal data will be kept in a form that allows us to identify you for a period of time strictly necessary. The data collection and the subsequent administration always takes place in compliance with the legal guidelines. To make sure that your personal data is always accurate, updated, relevant and complete, in order to provide you with a better service, we ask you to report any change to the following e-mail address: support_gb@woolrich.eu .
Apart from the provisions of the following point 8 of this Privacy Policy, also regarding the duration, Woolrich will manage your personal data for the following purposes:
a) perform, upon your express consent, customer profiling activity based on the purchase choices and the information provided optionally during registration / registration to the website and / or use of the related functionalities, also in order to create personalized promotions based on the your profile and services for the purchase of products on the Website;
b) update you, with your consent, on all promotional and direct marketing initiatives, including by e-mail.
The purposes for which your personal data is handled, will in any case, be specified from time to time in the information letter that Woolrich will send to the user of the site, whenever the assignment of personal data is requested.
It may happen that Woolrich (and Arvato only in respect of fiscal and/or accounting purposes) must handle the personal data of third parties directly communicated by their users, for example, when a user buys a product that is supposed to be delivered to the address of a friend, in other words, if the person who pays the price for the purchase of a product is not the same as the person for which the product is intended, or when a user recommends a service or a product that is on sale on the site, to a friend, or when a user asks for the invoice that is in the name of another person. In any of these cases, be sure that you have the consent of the person to whom the data relates before handing it over to Woolrich (or Arvato) by informing them about this Privacy Policy because you are the sole responsible person for the communication of information and of personal data relating to third parties, without the latter having explicitly required it, and for their incorrect or unlawful use. In any event, Woolrich will comply with its disclosure requirements towards the registered user, as required by law and its own knowledge, and will, if necessary, in the act of registration, again request his consent expressed concerning his own personal data archives.
Woolrich reserves the right to delete accounts of registered users, including all related data, in the event of finding content that is unlawful, detrimental to the Woolrich image and its products (or third party), or is offensive, or promotes illegal or defamatory activities that include pornographic elements, promote violence, racist, sexist, religious discrimination, or discrimination concerning gender orientation.
4. What happens if you do not authorize the use of your personal data by Woolrich and Arvato
The transmission of your personal data to Woolrich and/or to Arvato, and, in particular, your identification data, e-mail address, postal address, credit card number and bank details, as well as your telephone number, is necessary for the purchase contract conclusion for products on the website.
Likewise, the transmission of your data is essential to fulfill obligations arising from legal regulations or ordinances.
In contrast, the transmission of your data for the provision of other services of the website, if you should specifically request them, is optional.
Any refusal to submit the above mentioned personal data to Woolrich and/or Arvato will make it impossible to complete the purchase contract for products you ordered, or to perform them correctly, as well as to fulfill obligations related to legal regulations or ordinances which are the responsibility of the person imposed with the payment. Therefore, the legal basis for processing is Article 6, paragraph 1, lett. b of the Privacy Regulations and article 24, paragraph 1, lett. b of the Privacy Code. Instead, it is optional to provide your data for the provision of other services rendered on the Site (such as, for example, the sending of the Newsletter, the use of the Wishlist, the reporting of an article to a friend, etc.), if you should expressly request it.
The lack of transmission of your data, which is necessary for the performance of other services of the website, entails the impossibility of using them, but without affecting the execution of the purchase contract for the products of the website, or the use of the site.
Therefore, the legal basis for processing is Article 6, paragraph 1, lett. a of the Privacy Regulation and Article 23 of the Privacy Code.
5. To whom we share your personal data
Your personal data may be made available to third parties who perform specific services on behalf of Woolrich (and Arvato, for fiscal and/or accounting purposes) and who are nominated from time to time to be the parties responsible for the management of such data. The personal data may be communicated to other recipients - whose attributions are specified from time to time - in order to execute the purchase contract for the products of the website and only if this purpose is not incompatible with the other purposes for which your data was collected.
In addition to the companies who are responsible for remuneration, your data may also be made available to third parties who are independent persons responsible for remuneration or for incidental purposes that are correlated with the provision of services requested by the user (e.g. credit institutions for purchase transactions). You can always get an updated list of these companies by contacting the following e-mail address: support_gb@woolrich.eu (please specify "Info About Privacy Policy" as the subject of the mail).
Your personal data may also be communicated to the financial administration and / or other public authorities, the police, the judicial authorities or other competent authorities, always within the framework of the law and upon prior formal request from these subjects, for example, in the section of the anti-fraud services of the website.
Your personal data will not be transferred to other European countries or to other countries that are not members of the European Union and which can not guarantee an adequate level of protection like all member countries of the European Union. In the event that this is necessary to offer you services that you have requested or to execute a contract for the purchase of products with Woolrich, we guarantee that the transfer of your personal data to subjects located in countries outside the European Union that can not provide an adequate level of protection, will only take place between Woolrich and/or Arvato (if applicable) and these parties, upon prior conclusion of specific contracts, which include clauses to preserve the security of your personal data, according to law and regulations.
The data will not be passed on, sold or otherwise transferred to other third parties, unless the users have been informed in advance and have given their consent or if it is required by the law.
6. Safety measures
Woolrich (and Arvato, solely in relation to fiscal and/or accounting purposes) takes security measures - in compliance with the legislation in force also pursuant to art. 5 and 32 of the Privacy Regulation - aimed at reducing these risks to a minimum: (i) accidental destruction or loss of user data, (ii) unauthorized access, or (iii) any action, which is unauthorized or non-compliant with the collection purposes specified in our Privacy Policy. However, Woolrich (and Arvato, solely in relation to fiscal and/or accounting purposes) cannot guarantee to its own users that the measures taken for the security of the website and the transfer of data and information to the site itself, completely exclude any risk of unauthorized access or loss of data.
We advise you to ensure that your computer is equipped with adequate security software to ensure both incoming and outgoing data transmission (such as updated virus protection) and that your internet service provider has taken appropriate security measures for online data transfer (such as firewalls or antispam filters).
7. Opt-in / Opt-out
Woolrich can also use your personal details to send you promotional and direct marketing material or other commercial communications, including e-mails.
If these advertising communications correspond to products you have already purchased, Woolrich may send them to your e-mail address in the future, even without your express consent, as long as you have not refused this type of use when entering your e-mail, or in subsequent occasions (Article 130, Comma 4 of the Privacy Code). Your consent is required in order to authorize Woolrich to send you advertising e-mails regarding products of other kinds than those you have already purchased. If Woolrich should send you this type of advertising communications related to the same type of product that you have already purchased, you will be informed that you can always unsubscribe at any time.
In all cases, Woolrich – at any time and without justification – grants its users the right to no longer receive these types of communications associated with the use of special services.
