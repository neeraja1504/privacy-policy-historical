Privacy Policy
Document revised: March 14th, 2018
1. Introduction
Welcome and thank you for visiting Woozworld’s website located at www.woozworld.com  (the “Website ”). At Woozworld Inc., a company based in Montreal, Province of Quebec in Canada (“ Woozworld ”, “ we ”, “ us ” or “ our ”), we are committed to protecting the online privacy of our members and guests of our Website. To that end, we have designed this privacy policy (the “ Policy ”) to address your questions and concerns about our practices and principles for personally identifiable information (“ PII ”), including how we collect, use and disclose such information.
If you are a minor, your parent or legal guardian (a “Parent”) must review the Code of Conduct , this Policy and the Terms of Use of the Website with you, explain anything that you may not fully understand and approve them with you. Woozworld offers the Website to the Parents and their children (referred to as “ you ”, “ your ” or “ user ”) in accordance with this Policy. Parents, please help us protect your children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide PII on this Website or any other without your permission.
Woozworld applies its best efforts and generally accepted industry standards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your PII. We do not collect or keep any PII from you unless you volunteer it. A child’s participation in an activity is not conditional to the child providing more PII than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
This Policy is applicable to the Website and all associated products and services available on the Website. It summarizes Woozworld’s data collection policies and practices on the Website and does not apply to the practices of companies that Woozworld does not own or control, or to people that Woozworld does not employ or manage.
Your use of the Website means that you accept the terms of this Policy. By using the Website, you agree to the collection, use, transfer and processing of PII as described in this Policy by Woozworld. If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, please discontinue the use of the Website immediately and at all times.
2. COPPA and PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program
Woozworld complies with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“ COPPA ”). The COPPA requires that we inform the Parents on how we collect and use PII from their children under the age of 13.
Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) is a Member of the PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program ( “the Program” ). As a participating member in the Program, Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) adheres to the strict information collection, use and disclosure requirements set forth by the Program. PRIVO is an independent, third-party organization committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online. PRIVO aims to help parents and their children exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. The PRIVO certification seal posted on this page indicates that Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) has established COPPA compliant privacy practices and has agreed to submit to PRIVO’s oversight and consumer dispute resolution process. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact. If you have further concerns after you have contacted us, you can contact PRIVO directly at privacy@privo.com.
3. What information is collected and how it is used
When an account is created, the user’s date of birth , gender and email address are requested. If the user is under the age of 13, the Parent’s email is also required. Woozworld will communicate by email with the Parent notifying the Parent that the account was created and giving the Parent the option to ask for the account deletion along with all the PII collected at registration. The email address of a child under 13 will only be used for login and password reminder purposes. Woozworld will communicate with a child of 13 and over when the account is created, to validate the child’s email address.
The age and gender are used as aggregate statistical data to gain insight within the Website’s audience. The age is also used, as explained above, to determine if a user is under the age of 13 in order to obtain the Parent’s email.
Your email can be used to identify your account if you contact Woozworld for any questions or assistance. The child’s email address will never be publicly visible in the advanced features and the Parent’s email address is never visible anywhere. Within the scope of the advanced features, Woozworld will send you communications such as updates, notifications, promotional invitations and news concerning the Website, through the games messaging system.
The text entered in the WoozIn, as well as in-game chat and in private messages is filtered through CommunitySift smart filtering system, which aims to prevent, amongst other things, the user from exchanging PII such as phone numbers or email addresses with other users. CommunitySift does not share our user’s information with any other third parties.
Depending on the user’s method of payment in our online stores (and if they are over 13 years old,  located in the United States), some additional PII will be requested as described below. We use Secure Sockets Layer technology to protect credit card data during transmission and our transaction operators adopt strict internal procedures to safeguard this information in their system. Our payment solution providers are also under contract to safeguard your PII and not to share it under any circumstances.
Content Retention Policy
When you cancel your account, we keep your data on our servers for at least 30 days in case you change your mind. Beyond that we purge account data from our servers on a regular basis. The purge removes all personal information from the account, blocks your woozin, unfriends all contacts and locks all virtual spaces. You can specifically request to have your request reversed by contacting us fill this form https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?cacr before the 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be permanently deleted.
The following private information is kept while the account is active:
cookie id as visitor unique identifier
email as account unique identifier
avatar name
IP
4. Advanced Features
Communications
As explained above, Woozworld may send you updates, notifications, promotional invitations or news concerning the Website through the games messaging system.
Contests and surveys
If you participate in our contests and surveys no PII will be required to do so. If you win a prize within a contest, which needs to be awarded outside the Website, we will communicate with you through the validated email address provided when you created your account and will agree with you how to award your prize. If you are under the age of 13, these arrangements will be taken care of with your Parent and your Parent’s full verifiable consent will be required in order to provide us your mailing address and other PII needed to award your prize.
Online Stores
We offer the opportunity to purchase products in our online stores. When a user places an order, our third party’s transaction processor will require the following PII for a payment:
- by credit card: username , full name of card holder , email address , mailing address and credit card information ; or - by cell phone (SMS): username, cell phone number and email address.
After an order online is placed, we send a confirming email message and/or a SMS depending on the payment method. We may also send an occasional email featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to you. Any user who prefers not to receive promotional emails can indicate this preference in the account settings. Please note that, for legal reasons and for your protection, it is not possible to unsubscribe from transaction confirmation notifications when buying from the Website.
For purchases made by credit card or through a PayPal account, the purchaser must be at least 18 year old and have a valid credit card or bank account. The SMS method of payment is not offered to users under 13 of age in the USA.
Upcoming developments
We are always working on new ideas to make the Website even more fun. We may send notification through the games messaging system to promote challenges, contests, leaderboard updates, new games and weekly digests.

6. Third Parties
Except for third parties required in operating the Website as described previously and except as described below, we never share PII with people or companies outside Woozworld or sell it.

Once the account has been created and the user’s age has been determined to be 13 or older, the account becomes subject to regular advertisement. If the user’s age is below 13, the account is subject to COPPA compliant advertisement only. Users without an account are always considered to be under 13 and subject to COPPA compliant advertisement only. For more information on our third parties/partners, please click here.
