Your privacy is very important to us. As part of the normal operations of the Company services, your personal information will be collected and used. This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect and our use of that information. Information Collection & Use
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
Through customer surveys, subscriptions and newsletter registration, our site may request users to provide personal contact information (such as name, locale, email and telephone). The demographic information is used, among other things to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters.
Our sites use an order form for customers to subscribe to our paid services. We collect contact information and financial information (like credit card numbers). Contact information is used for billing purposes, as well as to contact the subscribers when necessary. We do not share personal financial information with any other parties.
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.

1. We host solely and all information collected is kept within the company.
2. We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes.
3. In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared.

However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter.
