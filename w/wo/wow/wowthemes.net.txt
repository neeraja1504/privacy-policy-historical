Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party links on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We are not responsible for the content of any linked website and cannot take responsibility for the consequences of your using the information or services on linked websites. We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the time. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

We store data via contact forms, subscribe forms, comments but we never use them. Product demo websites have no real purpose other than introducing a product’s design and/or functionality. We assume you are only testing the functionality of that specific product while submitting the forms thus we never use your data in response. However, you can of course exercise your GDPR rights.
