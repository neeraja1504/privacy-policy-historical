Our website uses a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about the ways visitors use the site. Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, pages viewed, length of time spent browsing, and sites visited immediately before and after our site.

What’s a Cookie?
Cookies are tiny data files that are stored on your computer to enable websites to identify you and keep track of your preferences. They may be temporary (for one session only) or persistent (permanently stored on your hard disk). Cookies help websites to make your online experience easier and more personalized. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
Active information helps us administer our business activities, provide customer support and other services, and determine what coupons or deals may be of interest to our users. We may use it to contact you about changes to our site; new services, features, or products; or information that we think will be valuable to you. If at any time you do not wish to receive such information, please send us an e-mail at   elalpo@runbox.com.
Passive information enables us to make our site easier to use, faster, and friendlier. We use cookies to gather data about how many people visit our site, when they visit, and how they use our service. We do NOT identify any of this information with your name or e-mail address; it’s strictly anonymous. But it helps us tailor the advertising you see on our site to your interests and viewing habits.
