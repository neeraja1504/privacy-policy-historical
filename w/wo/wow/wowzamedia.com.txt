How We Share Your Information
In general, Wowza does not sell, rent, or share personal information about you to outside third parties other than authorized vendors, service providers, and partners. Wowza may share the information that we collect about you, including personally identifiable information, as follows:
Other Wowza Customers and Site Visitors. Your user name, name, and other information that you post to the Site, including, without limitation, reviews, comments, and feedback will be available to, and may be searchable by, other users of the Site, regardless of whether they have signed up or otherwise identified themselves to Wowza. Even if it appears presently that such information about you is not available to others, we may change or improve Site functionality in the future, resulting in such information being available to other Wowza customers and Site visitors.
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, and Partners. We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates, subsidiaries, and partners (including resellers, for example); however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information will be subject to this Policy, and, where required by law, we will obtain your consent to such transfers.
Service Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. These include, as an example, payment processors, to whom we transfer information about you in order to bill and collect payment for the Software and Services.
Business Transfers. If we are a party to a merger, acquisition, or other corporate restructuring (or similar activity), we may transfer the information we have collected to another company party to such activity. Similarly, if we are a party to a bankruptcy proceeding, the information we have collected about you may be transferred to an acquiring or merged entity.
In Response to Legal Process. We may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with applicable law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
To Protect Us and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, suspected or actual violations of our this Policy or other agreements (including acceptable use policies) between you and Wowza or our partners, or as evidence in litigation in which Company is involved.
Aggregate and De-Identified Information. We may share aggregate or de-identified information about our users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or other purposes.
Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms by Wowza
Wowza may use cookies, local storage objects (“LSOs”), clear GIFs, and other tracking mechanisms to track your use of our Site, Software, and Services.
Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, the Software, and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site, in our Software, and while using our Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features, including shopping cart and purchases, may not function fully or in the manner intended if you disable cookies.
Local Storage Objects, Clear GIFs, tracking pixels and pixel tags, and other technologies. We may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”), to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit to our Site. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of LSOs through your web browser. Similarly, clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in functionality to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
User Profiles
We may combine information gathered from cookies and other tracking mechanisms with other personal information we collect from you in order to be able to provide a more personalized service to you. If you do not agree to such user profiling, you may opt-out by contacting us at LegalNotices@wowza.com. In this case, we will send an opt-out cookie to your computer which needs to be stored permanently. In case you delete such cookie, you must install such cookie again the next time you visit our site.
Third-Party Analytics, Ad Networks, and Links
Third-Party Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, along with other analytic means, to evaluate usage of the Site, Software, and Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, Software, and Services, including the performance and user experiences for each. These third-party devices and applications may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of data they collect or obtain. Please review our Cookies Policy below for additional information on the third party analytics and ad networks we work with, including how to opt-out.
Third-Party Ad Networks. Similarly, we work with third parties, such as network advertisers, to display advertisements on our Site, Services and Software, as well as to display Company ads on third-party websites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your use of our Site, Software, and Services, along with other third-party website and mobile applications usage. This enables both Wowza and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site, Software, and our Services.
Third-Party Links. The Site, Software, and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites and do not have the ability to control such practices.
Flurry Analytics. Some Software utilizes a third-party tracking service provided by a company called Flurry. Although Flurry provides a mechanism to opt out of tracking by Flurry, opting out of Flurry services will not impact other ad networks or analytics providers.
Your Choice
You may always choose whether to share information about yourself with Wowza. Although our Site, Software, and Services may each fail to provide you with certain functionality or benefits if you do decline to provide information to Wowza. The Wowza Site presently does not honor browser requests or signals not to be tracked and does not subscribe or respond to “Do Not Track” lists or similar services.
Security of Personal Information
We have implemented commercially reasonable measures to protect the information we collect about you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Of course, despite any amount of effort, no data security measures can guarantee security or confidentiality, and we encourage you to also take prudent measures to protect your information. Prudent steps include signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password information private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Where Wowza Operates
Wowza is a global organization and your information may be transferred, stored, and processed anywhere in the world, including the U.S., European Union, (including Germany, Ireland and the UK), Japan, South Korea and China. By providing us with your information, including (where applicable) personally identifiable information, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing of your information anywhere in the world. Some foreign jurisdictions may have information protection laws less stringent than those in your home jurisdiction.
Updates to this Policy
Wowza may update this Policy occasionally to ensure that you are informed of our practices with regard to personal information. When we update this policy, we will update www.wowza.com/legal/privacy and, depending on our view of the significance of the update, send an email to all Site, Software, and Services users notifying them of the update. Your continued use of the Site, Software, or Services following such an update to this Policy on the Site indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.
