1. The Wowd software will not share any data from your local file system. The Wowd software does not look at your local file system, only at web pages that are displayed in your browser.
2. The Wowd software will not track your personal behavior. Wowd, as a company, doesn't have access to this information. None of the data that is added to the Wowd system from your machine will be associated with you as a user or with your computer's IP address.
3. The Wowd software will not keep track of the searches you perform within the Wowd system. Wowd, as a company, doesn't maintain logs of what its users are searching for, or how they use the system.
4. The Wowd software provides you with a way to browse and search within your own web browsing history. However, all of your history data is kept only on your own computer. None of it is published or shared with anyone, not even with Wowd, the company. This means that you can store and search your web history without having your privacy compromised.
5. The Wowd software will not capture or transmit from your computer the contents of "private pages", including:
a. Secure pages, e.g. those with "https:" in the URL. This includes most financial institutions.
b. Pages that require some form of login to access. This includes such sites as Yahoo Mail, GMail, Facebook, etc.
c. Pages that provide time-limited access to their content.
d. Pages from sites that you have designated as "private".
6. The Wowd software gives you complete control over what is shared from your computer. You can specify a set of sites for which no data will ever be shared. You can do this by using "blacklist" in the Wowd software settings page.
