The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.
If you visit our site to browse or read information such as news, weather, sports scores and the like (subject to the Google Analytics section below): We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. None of the above information can personally identify you or anyone in your household. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.
If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail: You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail message containing a comment or complaint.

If you identify yourself by completing a "comment" form: We require that you use your email address when completing our online comments form. This is to help prevent abuse or malicious use of this valuable line of communication. We may also use your email address if you have requested a reply to a question. Your email address, comments, and other information from the form is only stored in an archive fashion, and is not made part of any other mailing list or database. Some of the information that you may be asked to supply (cable system, home town, etc.) is typically used in an aggregate form for statistical or analytical purposes.
If you complete an online contest entry form: We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Unless indicated otherwise, your name, postal address, email address and the like on a contest entry form is used solely for our direct contact with you.
