This Privacy Policy describes HMH’s collection, use, and sharing of information associated with
the HMH online assessment platform (“"the Product”) made available through this website (the
“website” or “site”). “You” and “Your” refer to anyone using the Product via our site. Use of the
Product entails Your submission of Submitted Data (as that term is defined below) as well as our
passive collection of technical and other information in connection with Your use of the Product

To the extent particular information qualifies as Protected Health Information (PHI) under the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and HIPAA affords greater
privacy protections than those set forth in this Privacy Policy, HMH will comply with the
relevant HIPAA requirements regarding privacy for that particular information.

products and services, as permitted under HIPAA and FERPA.
How We Share Information
We do not sell, rent, or license Your Personal Information to anyone. We do share Personal
Information with other companies in the following situations:
Sharing Your Information with Subcontractors. We may share information with
subcontractors that act as our agent and that provide us with services related to the provision or
operation of the Product. These services may include, among other things, helping us to provide
products or services that You request, creating or maintaining our databases, processing orders

Information is required either contractually or by law to keep Your Personal Information
confidential and not to disclose or repurpose the information, and to use such information only as
required for the services to be performed.
Law Enforcement and Legal Process. We may disclose Personal Information to government
and regulatory agencies to comply with a court order or as otherwise required by applicable law.

the entity responsible for the information under this Privacy Policy, provided the acquiring third
party has agreed to safeguard Your Submitted Data with protections that in all material respects
are the same as or more protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy.

a “Do-Not-Track” flag from browser software.
