Country : Some of our games are not available in countries where other publishers own the distribution rights. Therefore, we require country information to allow access to our games. We provide country information to our advertising partners.
Valid email address : We collect your email information only if you are 18 or older, or we have received the permission of the parent or legal guardian. You can use your email to retrieve your User ID if you have forgotten it. Based on your email selections, we will email you information about our games such as updates and new games. You will never receive emails from us with offerings on behalf of other companies.

When a child under 18 years of age signs up, we do not collect their email address without the permission of their parent or legal guardian. We will also not collect the other items listed above. If a child under 18 years of age wants to post information on our website or chat with other players, we will require that they do not disclose any personal information such as their real name, address, phone number, and any other information that could be used to contact the child.
Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies, and you must read the Privacy Policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site.
When purchasing game items or subscriptions to our games, you will have the choice to pay by PayPal, Moneybookers, mobile phone, bill to your home phone, or any other e-commerce available today or in the future. We will collect the required information for each payment method, however. This information will be kept confidential and is only shared under industry standard security methodologies to the billing partners. The billing partners have no right to use your information other than completing the billing process you have initiated.
We ask that you educate your child to never give out their email, name, address, phone, or pager information without parental consent. Tell them to always notify a parent or guardian when they feel threatened or are asked for any personal information. The parent should then contact us immediately.
