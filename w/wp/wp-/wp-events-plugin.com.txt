Data collected by the Events Manager Pro plugin and other commercially available plugins we provide
When you install our plugin on your site, this plugin will send your website domain, IP address and license key for the purposes of verifying your license validity. We do not collect any site or personal data, and should we ever do so in the future, we will explicitly ask for your consent and explain what data we will collect.
Who we share your data with
We do not and will never sell or transfer your data for reasons other than providing you with a better service on our own websites. All third party services have their own privacy policies in accordance to European GDPR laws. We use various services in order to achieve this including:
Braintree – We use Braintree to process credit card payments and store payment information securely. During checkout, payment information is transferred to Braintree and not stored on our site.
PayPal – We also use PayPal for payment processing, you must have a PayPal account to use their service, who have their own privacy policy and terms of service.
Amazon Services – We use Amazon CDN services to serve our website content faster around the world, which may collect your IP address and browser information when accessing that content.
Slack – We use slack for internal communication between our employees and may therefore need to reference you, the customer, in order to provide contracted support services.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website, we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile, including name, email, billing address and any websites licensed to use our software. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
How we protect your data and what data breach procedures we have in place
We protect customer data with the following site features:
We are entirely using SSL/HTTPS throughout all our sites. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so personal identifiable information is never captured by third parties without authorization.
We use firewalls and malware scanners to prevent unauthorized access to your data.
Databases are sanitized (actual user personal details are removed) before deploying to development or testing environment.
In case of a data breach, System administrators will immediately go through affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed after informing the user.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data that is vital to you being our customer (i.e. basic account information like an email address and billing address for fiscal purposes).
You can request this information or erasure by contacting us here.
