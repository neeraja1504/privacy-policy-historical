Data shared with our support
Sometimes, to help our support debug a Toolset-related issue on your site, we might ask you to share a copy of your site with us. Since this is your site, you are the one responsible for its data and we strongly encourage you to remove any personal information from the database before sharing it with us.
That being said, here are some important points about what happens with the site duplicates and data that is shared with our support:
When a debug or setting check is needed, we ask for access to the site or even a full copy of the site.
We use that access/duplicates strictly for debugging.
We do not share that data with anyone outside of the company.
We might need to share the duplicates with OnTheGoSystems supporters and developers when the case requires it.
We destroy this information after we finish debugging and resolve your issue.
Our forum is public but any outside URL is automatically masked and any private information is shared only in private comment seen only by the supporters and the client that reported the issue.
Again, we strongly encourage you to remove any personal/sensitive information that the site might hold before sharing access/duplication if you are concerned about it.
We cannot be held responsible for any loss of private information from databases if that should occur. In other words, you should have a fully working backup of whatever site you share with us.
Data collected by the Toolset plugins you use
The Toolset plugins are fully compliant with GDPR.
If you give them explicit consent, the only data they can collect is which theme and plugins your site is using. This information is used only for providing you with faster and better support. Toolset plugins will prompt you and require explicit action, asking you if you want to share with us this information. If you decline, it will not collect any data whatsoever.
These cookies only communicate with your site and never with Toolset.com. The only communication mechanisms from your site to our are:
1. When you register the plugins on Toolset.com for automatic renewals.
2. If you choose to send us details about the theme and plugins that you use (we use this information to send you alerts about compatibility issues, and you choose if you want to send it or not)
Other than this, any cookies are only intended to keep the “state” of pages between the browser and your server. Whenever possible, we keep information in the DOM and not in cookies, but that’s not always possible.
We don’t share your data with third-parties in a way as to reveal any of your personal information like email, name, etc. However, some data is transferred and/or stored with third-party services we use, like cloud-based services and payment processors. This is done as a way to provide you with a better overall service and user experience.
Here are the services we use to make our own service better for you:
Active Trail – we store our client contact details for newsletters, announcements, and usability testing invite purposes. They can opt-out of these at any time.
PayPal – we use Paypal as one of our payment processor. During checkout, a client will provide login information and credit card info. This information is processed directly within this gateway payment and we do not save it on our sites.
Stripe – we use Stripe as one of our payment processor. During checkout, a client will provide credit card info. These are all stored in the Stripe site.
Amazon SES – we use this services to manage mailing campaigns to our clients. What is shared are client contact details (name and client email).
Who can see my personal information
If you are not a registered client in our site, there is no personal information we have or can see about you.
If you are a client with a Toolset account, your personal information can be accessed by:
Our System administrators.
Our supporters when they need to (in order to provide support) get the information about the client accounts and access.
How long we retain your data
When you submit a support ticket or a comment, its metadata is retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead of holding them for moderation.
If you register on our website, we also store the personal information you provide in your user profile. You can see, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except changing your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
How we protect your data and what data breach procedures we have in place
We protect customer data with the following site features:
We are entirely using SSL/HTTPS throughout all our sites. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so personal identifiable information is never captured by third parties without authorization.
Databases are sanitized (actual user personal details are removed) before deploying to development or testing environment.
In case of a data breach, System administrators will immediately go through affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed after informing the user.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data that is vital to you being currently our customer (i.e. basic account information like an email address).
For these requests, please use this form.
