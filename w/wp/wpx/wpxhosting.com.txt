OK, but what do you DO with this information?
Because your personal information is so valuable to both you and us, we strongly believe in minimising the personal information we collect as well as limiting its use and purpose.
We will use this information as necessary to carry out our obligations, arising from any contracts between you and us, for which we have been given permission.

In technical terms, your information is primarily used to:
Improve internal operations, such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and for statistical and survey purposes;

How do you store my information?
As standard, we may store your information in hard copy or electronic format within storage facilities which we own and operate ourselves, or that are owned and operated by our service providers.
It is possible that some of your information that we hold may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA') which may not provide the same level of protection as within the EEA.

Is my information safe?

We seek to ensure that we keep your personal data accurate and up to date however, you are responsible for informing us of any changes to your personal data and other information (such as a change in contact details).
While we take these steps to maintain the security of your information, you should be aware of the many information security risks that exist and take appropriate care to help safeguard your information.
