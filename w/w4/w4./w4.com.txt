Overview of W4's Technology:
Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. You may encounter our Technology: when W4 or one of our Business Partners purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Business Partners places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit.
We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the W4 Ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.

W4 does not collect PII via our Technology. Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Business Partner web pages have been viewed, search terms entered on Business Partner websites, referring/exit pages, and the date and time a W4 Ad was viewed.
W4 uses this information to analyze trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement placement for our Business Partners accordingly. We also may aggregate this information and share it with W4's affiliates, advertisers, employees, customers and Business Partners.
Cookies and Web Beacons:
