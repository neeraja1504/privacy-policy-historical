To personalize user experience. Your data helps us to customize how the user interface and features look like for you, or provide you with tips, hints and training.
To improve our Service. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.

It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. We may use the email address to send User emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

How we protect your information
We adopt appropriate data protection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, passwords, transaction information, any content and data stored on our Service.
We are compliant with the "EU Data Protection Law" which means (i) prior to 25th May 2018, European Union Directive 95/46/EC; and (ii) on and after 25th May 2018, European Union Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR").
We do everything possible to protect your data. This includes but is not limited to HTTPS/SSL, SSH and other encryption protocols for data access. Sensitive and private data exchange between the Service and its Users happens mostly over a HTTPS/SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital encryption keys. Our servers are protected by firewalls and access fiters. Our Service is also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users.
We use system monitoring tools and logging to keep an eye on system usage and discover any security improvement points.
Our servers are located at a high grade security data center based in Tallinn, Estonia, in the European Union.
Access to our servers is limited to a limited number of our security-minded and trained employees.
Our team has over 20 years of experience in developing and running secure enterprise solutions and doing data security consulting. Our team has even founded a specialized data security firm that has served banks, large enterprises, and government institutions.
Each customer can only access data pertaining to their company account.
When payments are processed via credit card, we use third party vendors that are PCI DSS compliant.
However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error, so the Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Still we do our best to make sure your data is and remains 100% confidential.
In short
We do everything possible to protect your data

You have the right to object to the processing and collection of your personal data, and to withdraw your consent at any time, except where otherwise determined by applicable law. Whenever you withdraw consent, you acknowledge and accept that this will immediately terminate your use of the Service.

This provision does not apply to Personal Data that is part of Client Data for which Weekdone is just the data processor. In this case, the management of the Client Data is subject to the Client’s own Privacy Policy, and any request for access, correction or deletion should be made to the Client responsible for the uploading and storage of such data into the Service.

Sharing your personal information
We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others.

To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when it is required by law or official investigations, (3) when it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets.
