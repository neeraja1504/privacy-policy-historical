When you interact with us, you may share personal information with us that allows identification of you as an individual (e.g. name, email address, address, and telephone number). This is known as “ personal data ”.
This Privacy Policy applies where the Forum is acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of you as a visitor to our websites and as a user of the Forum platforms and/or services, in other words, where the Forum determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal data.
1. Scope and acceptance of this Privacy Policy

In addition, we process personal data that you provide through the Forum Sites, for example, when you enter personal details (e.g. name, gender, address, email address, phone/fax number) on a registration page or if you sign up for an email newsletter.
The Forum may use the personal data that you provide to us with your consent for a specified purpose or when you interact with Forum Sites or we process your data if we have legal basis, namely, with regards to your registration to Forum events or your request of Forum services.
Furthermore, we operate (I) custom platforms, which are fully built and maintained by the Forum (“Custom Platforms”); and (II) cooperate with platforms which provide individual Forum products or services, which are maintained and provided for by third-party providers (“Cooperation Platforms”), and (III) third party applications and services, which can be embedded or integrated into one of the platforms described under (I) or (II) (“Embedded Services”).
I. Custom Platforms
The Forum public websites are the external-facing platforms for public engagement with the Forum and provide insights into Forum activities, initiatives, projects and roadmaps. The public websites also provide other services such as a blog, articles of general interest and livestreaming services of sessions and events during the said events and sessions. Forum public websites may also contain links or login options that connect to TopLink.
The public websites use third party cookies for analytics (Google Analytics, Chartbeat, Parse.ly and mixpanel) and to track common metrics such as platform engagement, concurrent users, maximum number of users, time spent on a page, etc. Any use of such analytics cookies is to improve your user experience and provide the Forum with valuable information to help the Forum to better tailor our services to our partners, members, constituents and participants.
ESMS is a staff and event registration and management system. This platform is used by the Forum to register staff and external resources to Forum events. Personal data that you provide for your registration to this service, in particular name, address, email, copy of passport, date of birth, are used by the Forum to conclude event registration and related activities like hotel bookings, flight bookings and venue access.
ESMS uses session cookies for tracking user logins and ensuring that the authenticated user is allowed to access to authenticated services.
TopLink is the Forum platform for constituents and participants of the Forum events to engage directly with the events and other Forum activities. TopLink is also the de facto messaging platform for constituents and participants and is used to browse event agendas, book meetings, generally interact with peers and take part in sessions.
Further information is available in the TopLink Privacy Policy.

5. “Cookie Notice”
5.1 About cookies
A cookie is a small piece of information that a web server asks the user’s browser to store on the user’s local computer, and then later their browser presents this information to the web server. In its simplest form, a cookie is an identifying number.
5.2 What type of cookies do we use?
We use two types of cookies on Forum Sites: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Forum Sites or interact with our services without signing in again. In the event you sign up to one of our platforms, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by the service when you return to one of our sites. Session cookies only last as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).
We use cookies for anonymous user tracking. The Forum web server assigns each user a unique numerical ID (“ ID ”). All requests for pages are tagged with that ID, and by analyzing the log files, the Forum can determine how many unique users use Forum Sites.
5.3 How do we use cookies?
The Forum does not know the identity of a person based on the ID. The cookies used by the Forum do not contain any personal data about you nor are they used to look up your personal data. Even if you have entered personal data about yourself in one of the Forum’s registration forms, the Forum does not relate that information to the cookie data.
The Forum Sites may use cookies for analytics and to improve your user experience. Forum Sites will usually not natively use cookies but our analytics providers do use these cookies to improve user experience.
Our analytics providers include:
- chartbeat [Privacy Policy]
- mix panel [Privacy Policy]
These providers use cookies to tailor your user experience, gather statistics on usage and engagement and help better inform the Forum’s efforts to deliver world-class engagement, knowledge and events.
You are free to decline the cookies if your browser or browser add-on allows, except if the cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the security of Forum Sites that the Forum controls. However, disabling the use of cookies will result in a less user-friendly experience of the Forum Sites or can fully prevent you from using the Forum Sites.
6. How do we store or transfer your data?
The Forum has offices and facilities in Switzerland, the United States, Japan and China. The hosting facilities for our websites and Forum Custom Platforms are situated in Switzerland and the EU, the Chinese website is hosted in Singapore.
When transferring personal data internationally, we make sure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example, by entering into agreements that will ensure that the recipients of your information maintain an adequate level of data protection.
Information collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this Policy. We utilize standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, adopt other means under Swiss and European Union law and/or obtain your consent to legitimize data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries.
7. Security of personal data
The Forum is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. Any information provided to the Forum by you is handled with due care and security, and will not be used in ways other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or in any site/area-specific policies, or in ways to which users have not explicitly consented. The Forum employs a range of technologies and security measures to protect the information maintained on Forum systems from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, the Forum cannot ensure nor guarantee the security of any information that the user may transmit to Forum Sites. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of the Forum’s physical, technical or managerial safeguards.
All Forum employees who have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data are obliged to respect the confidentiality of all such personal data.
8. How long do we retain personal data?
The Forum will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or as long we require the personal data to provide you with the Forum services or products you requested, unless a longer retention period is required to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
9. How can you access your data or contact us?
You have a right to request access to your personal data. You may send us a request for access, provision of such information will be subject to the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity. You also have the right to request that the Forum corrects any inaccuracies in your personal data.
You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications or any other information from the Forum or about Forum events and can do so by (a) following the instructions for opt-out in the relevant marketing communication or (b) by contacting us.
