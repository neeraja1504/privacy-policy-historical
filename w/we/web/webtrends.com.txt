Information We Collect
Here are a few ways we collect your information and the types of information we collect. We may also obtain information from other sources. Information we collect may be in the form of personal information or anonymized data. Anonymized data may be in the form of aggregate data. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our products and services. This Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate data.
Information You Provide To Us
We collect personal information you give us. These are the general types of information we may collect from you:
Registration and Profile Information – When you register to use our service, to receive information, to participate in our events, and create or update your forum profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you. For example, we may collect: your name; postal address; phone numbers; fax numbers and email address; your log-in ID and password; your title; company; and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information linked with your profile such as comments you may post.
Submissions and Customer Service – From time to time we may use surveys, contests, or sweepstakes requesting personal information. Information we collect may include demographic information, information about your personal interests, and your feedback as a valued client.

Sharing Of Personal Information
Information You Share
We may engage third parties to provide forums that allow you to connect and share your profile, actions, comments, content, and information publicly and with others. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. To learn how the third party applications use your information, please review their privacy policies. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, follow the instructions in the section titled Your Information Choices and Changes below. We may also allow you to connect and share on third party sites and services. For example, we use a single sign-on service that allows you to sign into Webtrends forums using certain third-party social networking login credentials. This allows you to link your existing social network profile to your Webtrends account. Once connected, you will be able to share and post content on and with the third-party site from Webtrends and share and interact with your friends.
Please be mindful of your own privacy needs as you choose with which third party services to connect, with whom you connect, and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. If you share information about others, we suggest you get consent for any information you may share about them.
Webtrends uses the SalesForce platform to power its client portal (https://my.webtrends.com). All personal data collected within this portal is owned by Webtrends; SalesForce’s only right is that of a data processor acting on behalf of Webtrends as data controller. Processing such personal data is intrinsic to the purpose of the portal. Should you not want your personal data to be processed, your only option is to stop using the portal – you can do so by contacting comprefs@webtrends.com.
Information We Share
Corporate Websites only – We do not sell and share your personal information with third parties other than as follows:

with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers such as email service providers, marketing service providers, blog service providers and forum service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us, these service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;
when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets.

Retention and Security of your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure transport layer security (TLS). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, including encryption in transit, strict access controls, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, hardening and patching procedures, and malware protection. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
