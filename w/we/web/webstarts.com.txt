Information Gathered by WebStarts.com
WebStarts.com gathers two types of information about users:
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions when creating a WebStarts account, such as your name or email address. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:
Email address
First name and last name
Phone number
Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City
Information WebStarts.com gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does WebStarts.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party unless mandated by law.
WebStarts.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
Optional Voluntary Information
We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
Free Web Hosting
During the account creation process, the user is required to supply full name, username, password, and email address. Except as specified in this Privacy statement, we will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
You can access and update your personal information by logging in and visiting your Account Settings and following the instructions on that page, or by contacting customer support. If you delete such information, it cannot be used by us or disclosed to third parties in the future. Even if you delete or change some personal information in our registration database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes).
Any files uploaded or created on the WebStarts system are by nature of being hosted for the public and are thus publicly accessible. If you have content that you do not want to make publicy available on the internet, do not place that content on your website.
"Email this to a friend" Service
Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page or documents to someone else by clicking "email this to a friend". Users must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email.
Polling
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. WebStarts.com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
Surveys
WebStarts.com may occasionally conduct optional user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
Usage tracking
WebStarts.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. WebStarts.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
WebStarts.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for our users.
Cookies
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. WebStarts.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.
Use of Data
WebStarts uses the collected data for various purposes:
To provide and maintain our Service
To notify you about changes to our Service
To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so
To provide customer support
To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service
To monitor the usage of our Service
To detect, prevent and address technical issues
To provide you with news, special offers and general information about other goods, services and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about unless you have opted not to receive such information
WebStarts.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the needs and interests of our users.
When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, we do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.
WebStarts.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This allows us to more effectively tailor advertising and promotions to our users.
