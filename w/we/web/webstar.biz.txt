partners of WellStar. These can be found in the Declaration of Privacy for sales partners.
It is possible to search for other members on webstar. Webstar members cannot be found on external
search engines such as Google. Not having a login or password, robots/crawlers used by search engines
cannot gain access to webstar, i.e. profile data is not displayed in external search engines. We cannot,
however, provide a guarantee for this.                                                                             Data protection declaration
Data transfer
WellStar shall not pass on data for promotional or other purposes to third parties, unless this has
explicitly been stated in the Declaration of Privacy.
Your registration, profile and vitality data are passed on to your personal vitality coach. Your coach is
obliged to treat the data they receive confidentially and to use it exclusively to provide vitality advice, and
to fulfil their contractual obligations.
Your vitality coach is also automatically classed as your friend in the webstar community and can be
“downgraded” by you to an acquaintance.
Within the scope of directly ordering goods from WellStar in the WellStar shop, it may also be necessary
to pass on your ordering data to the companies in charge of production and the delivery of goods, as well
as the bank responsible for the settlement of payments. They too are obliged to treat all data they receive
confidentially and to use it exclusively to fulfil their contractual obligations.
WellStar enters into cooperation agreements with external providers, known as shop partners. These
shop partners are given personalised shops on the webstar sites. If you choose to make use of the offers
of shop partners, your ordering data will be passed on to the corresponding shop partners. Detailed
information on credit cards and account numbers will be collected directly by the respective shop partner
and hence not be conveyed by WellStar. The shop partners are also obliged to treat all data they receive
confidentially and exclusively for the purpose of executing their contractual obligations.
In order to be able to provide an attractive range of products from our shop partners, our shop partners
regularly inform WellStar about which products you have purchased from the respective shop partner and
the amount you have spent.
Furthermore, WellStar will only disclose your data to third parties in cases where there is a legal
obligation to do so. By using webstar, you agree to data about you being collected, processed and used by
WellStar in the aforementioned manner and for the aforementioned purpose.
Newsletters
WellStar automatically sends newsletters by e-mail to remind you of your plans (e.g. fitness plans or
dietary plans). At your explicit request, you will receive a regular newsletter by e-mail with information
about new developments and current offers by webstar and WellStar.
