The types of information we collect

As further described below, by clicking on advertisements on the Site and taking advantage of sponsored content on the Site, you consent to the delivery of the personal information gathered by Exelixis Media P.C. to Exelixis Media’s advertisers and sponsors. We collect personally identifiable information, which includes, among others, name and e-mail address.

Cookies
Exelixis Media P.C. and our advertisers may send “cookies” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie can’t read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies as part of the Site to store your viewing preferences on the Site and, at your choosing, to store your login information so that once you have logged in you do not need to repeat the login process. We also use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Furthermore we use a cookie to count Web page accesses and gather general statistical information. We may also allow our third party partners to place their own cookies on your computer in order to serve you with relevant advertising online. This third party cookie may transfer non-personally identifiable information to the third party partner in order for them to track your activity when you visit our Sites and on sites outside the Exelixis Media P.C. network for purposes of serving you ads on topics in which you have a demonstrated interest based on your clickstream data; please note that we do not share member information with these third parties and we can only access cookies that we set on your computer, not the cookies sent to you by other companies. Also, when you leave the Exelixis Media P.C. network of Sites by clicking on sponsored content or advertising, these third parties may place cookies or clear GIFs on your computer. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information collected by third parties, such as through cookies or clear GIFs, when you visit their web sites or by third parties regarding your clickstream activity on sites other than Exelixis Media P.C. network of Sites. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site will be limited.
Pixel Tags
Exelixis Media P.C., its third party service providers and advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as pixel tags, web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. We may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. Exelixis Media P.C. does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers and third party providers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user’s computer. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements. Exelixis Media P.C. uses Google Analytics to measure site traffic, visitor behavior, and to improve delivery of services. To understand the information shared with Google, how it is processed, and how you can control the information collected by Google on the Site, visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
