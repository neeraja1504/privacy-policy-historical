Glossary of Terms
Usage Paths
A usage path is the trail of requests automatically transmitted to and logged by websitelooker.net as user surfs the Internet with the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon enabled. Usage paths consist of the following data for each Web page visited by a websitelooker.net user: (a) the IP address assigned to the user; (b) the date and time the Web page is visited by the user; (c) the full URL that the site assigns to the Web page.
Uniform Resource Locator
A URL (or uniform resource locator) is the full Web address of a file or document you view when browsing the Internet. With most browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, the URL of every Web page that you view is displayed in a window near the top of the screen. Typically, a URL consists of four parts: protocol, server (or domain) where the file is located, path, and filename. However, some URLs have no path or filename. An example of a URL is:
http://www.websitelooker.net/company/index.html
http is the protocol
www.websitelooker.net is the server
company/ is the path
index.html is the filename
Internet Protocol Address
An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your Web browser to request a Web page from another computer on the Internet, your Web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. For many users who access the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time they log on ("dynamic" IP addresses); others may be assigned only one IP address that remains the same from session to session ("static" IP addresses) (more common with broadband ISPs).
Domain Name
A domain name identifies one or more IP addresses. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL http://www.websitelooker.net/site/company, the domain name is websitelooker.net.
Cookies
A cookie is a small data file consisting of numbers, letters, or other characters that a server sends to your browser and stores on your computer's hard drive. The cookie automatically identifies your computer, but not your identity.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, if a browser is set to reject cookies, it may encounter functionality problems with the websitelooker.net .
Browser
A browser, short for Web browser, is a software application used to locate and display Web pages. Two popular browsers are Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
