Your privacy is very important to you and to us. Our continued success depends on the trust of our customers.
We store your email address to send to you regular updates of pages from the world wide web which you have elected to receive at times selected by you. In addition, if you send to us an email with a one-off request either for a web page to be sent to you or for a search to be made using your search words, we store your email address to deal with your specific request. We hold details on our database of sites to which you have subscribed or about which you have made a request.
We also use your email address to send to you from time to time a news letter with information about new products and services that are likely to be of interest to you. We will only send you this message if you give us your permission when you subscribe to Web2Mail. If you choose not to receive our news letters we will respect your privacy and guarantee that we only send you the regular emails with the web pages which you have requested.
We use your information to create information about you which we use to identify your preferences. This enables us to personalise offers, advertisements and services to suit your individual preferences.
