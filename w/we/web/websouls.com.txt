1. What information is collected and how is it used?
We ask you to supply certain information when you use our site, especially when you sign up with us as a customer. This information will be used in the management of our own database and to enable us to contact you about the service you have requested (for example, to confirm the registration of a domain name or to inform you of the need to renew your registration when it expires). We may also use your email address to send you our regular WebSouls newsletters. If you wish you may opt out from receiving these newsletters (see "WebSouls Newsletter" below). In addition, when you use our website we may store your IP address and may use this information to administer our website and help to diagnose any network or server problems. We may use cookies to keep track of your use of our website and e-commerce system. Information passed to us from your web browser may be stored and used in our internal statistical analysis. We may also automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use or the site from which you linked to our website. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on our website.
2. Do we share the information with anyone else?
WebSouls will not, without your consent, pass your personal information to a third party except in the following circumstances:
2.1 in order to register a domain name we are required to send certain information like your name, business name (if applicable), postal address and email address etc to organisations that formally record the registration; this information may be available to others via a "Whois" search;

Existing customers or other people who are interested in the newsletters may opt in or out by sending an email request to our support team.
5. Optional Services
From time to time WebSouls may offer additional services to our customers. In some cases these services may require us to pass personal data held by us to a third party. Any such service will be optional and the offer will be to those who have opted-in at the time of sign-up or otherwise.

8. Security
WebSouls places great importance on the security of all information associated with its customers and has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of customer data under our control. With regard to our website, we may use secure server software (SSL) to encrypt information you input before it is sent to us.
