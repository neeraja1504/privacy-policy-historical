WGS-Privacy
(As of: December 1, 2014)
At Wicked Good Software ("WickedGood", “WGS”, "we", "us" or "our"), we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information collected through our website or any of our related applications (the “Services”). Below we describe what information we collect when you use the Services, how we protect that information, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate. Our properties may provide links to third party websites and this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information you may provide while on such third party websites. We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its effective date, and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our website.
The Information We Collect
We explain the two ways that we collect and process information about you.
Information You Provide to Us
Account Information: You may choose to create an account and provide us with information in order to use certain services or to take advantage of special offers. If you create an account on WickedGood, we may store and use information such as your full name, email address, zip code, gender and birth date. You may provide this information directly to us or you may choose to register using your Facebook account in which case you would authorize us to access certain Facebook profile information including, but not limited to, your first name, last name, gender, birth date and email address. Please be mindful that your username from your email address, as well as your Facebook photo or any photo you submit through the registration process, will be publicly displayed as part of your account profile. You can always edit some of the information associated with your account here, or if you believe that an unauthorized account has been created using your name, or likeness, you can request its removal by using our online form here.
Public Content: You may also choose to post content (such as ratings, reviews, tips, photos or comments, likes, bookmarks, friends, lists) that may be shared with others through our Services or through your Facebook account. The information that you post to the Services is intended to be available for other users of WickedGood to read, including your posted content and reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Services, and your account profile. We may display this information on the Services, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
Contacts: You have the option to invite those of your friends that you think would like to join the Services, by providing their contact information. If you invite a friend to join and connect with you on the Services, we will only use your friend’s contact information to process your requests.
Communications: If you participate in a survey, poll, promotion, contest, or sweepstakes; submit a customer service or other inquiry to us; request to receive certain communications from us; or contact us about employment opportunities posted to the Services, we may collect contact information such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number.
Information We Collect When you Use the Services
When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store certain information about your computer or device and your activities, including:
IP address of your computer
Unique mobile device identifier
Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, web browser (Internet Explorer 8, etc.), other browser information (e.g. size, connection speed and connection type), and operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.)
Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.)
If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device's geographic location (specific geographic location if you've enabled collection of that information, or general geographic location automatically). Please see the section "How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location Information" below for further information.
Internet provider (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) or mobile carrier name (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.)
The URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting WickedGood
Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search queries, comments, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, how long you visited our Services, etc.)
Communications between you and other users or merchants through our Services
For mobile application users, the online or offline status of your application.
How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location Information. When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:
If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off location functionality for all of your applications so that the next time you download or use an application, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.
If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.
If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this information.
Cookies, Mobile Device IDs and Online Advertising:
Cookies: We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile device IDs, “flash cookies” and similar files or technologies to collect and store information in in respect to your use of the Services and third party websites(). A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer that enables us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our website, store your preferences and settings, enhance your experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform research and analytics, track your use of our Services, and assist with security and administrative functions. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session. To understand more about cookies, go to http://allaboutcookies.org.
Managing your Cookie Settings: Most browsers are set to automatically allow cookies. Please note it may be possible to disable some (but not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect your ability to use the Service. In addition, deleting or disabling cookies on one browser is unlikely to delete them on other browsers or other computers. Thus, you may have to delete or disable cookies in more than one location. Major browsers provide users with various options when it comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones WickedGood uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies. To modify your cookie settings, please refer to the following support pages for each browser you use to access the WickedGood website:

A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’ computers. WickedGood pixel tags are used to measure the popularity of our various pages, features and services.Advertising company pixel tags are used to measure the number of ad impressions and the performance of ads on our site, and to access the advertising company’s cookies placed on your computer. Data analytics company pixel tags are used to aggregate information about our advertising and your engagement with our site for market research, product improvement, revenue tracking and advertising optimization. Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.
Online and Mobile Advertising: We may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as WickedGood does for itself. Advertisers and advertising networks place ads on our website and mobile applications. These companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect information, such as your computer’s IP address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our Services. These companies also may use cookies and pixel tags to collect data about you when you visit our site. Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record and associate your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. We do not, as a matter of course, have access to, or control over the Cookies these third parties use, but you may be able to opt-out of some of their practices, by visiting the links listed below. Please note however that opting out will not stop the display of advertisement to you.

If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s Ads Preferences page from a browser on your device and make your choices there.

Some of our products, services and databases are hosted by third party hosting services providers.

We may share information about you with these vendors to enable them to perform their services.
We may share your information with our affiliates, which are entities under common ownership or control of our ultimate parent company IAC/InterActiveCorp.
