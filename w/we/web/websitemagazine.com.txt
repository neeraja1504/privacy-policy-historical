CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13, COPPA COMPLIANCE
WM is a general audience web site intended to be used by people of all ages. This section gives specific details regarding information collected from children. Personal information is defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 as 1) a first and last name; 2) a home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town; 3) an e-mail address; 4) a telephone number; 5) a Social Security number; 6) any other identifier that the FTC determines permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual; or 7) information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the web site collects online from the child and combines with an identifier. When a child registers for any of our child services we collect the following information: name, address, birth date, phone, email address and email address of the parent/guardian to validate ages.
When a child under the age of 13 attempts to register with WM, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian create a special account at (websitemagazine.com) in order for us to obtain parental consent. Verifiable parental consent is defined under the Act as any reasonable effort (taking into consideration available technology), including a request for authorization for future collection, use, and disclosure described in the notice, to ensure that a parent of a child receives notice of the operator’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices, and authorizes the collection, use, and disclosure, as applicable, of personal information and the subsequent use of that information before that information is collected from that child.
A child’s participation in a game, contest or other activity sponsored in our children’s section is not conditioned upon the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity. We will not contact a child under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without first obtaining permission from a parent or legal guardian.
Upon request of a parent or guardian and verification that this parent or guardian is indeed authorized to receive such information, 1) we will provide the parent or guardian with a description of the specific types of personal information collected from the child; 2) the opportunity to refuse at any time, our ability or further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online collection, of personal information from that child; 3) and means that is reasonable under the circumstances for the parent to obtain any personal information collected from that child. Should you refuse to allow us to continue the collection of information from your child as described in option 2 above, we reserve the right to terminate your child’s account or participation in our child programs. Additionally it should be noted that cookies are used for children in the same manner as they are for adults who use our web site. You have the option of disabling your computer to accept cookies.
