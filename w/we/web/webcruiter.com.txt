Privacy policy
1. Terms and expressions
First, let us define some important concepts:
Personal data is any information that can be directly or indirectly linked to you as an individual. Please see the section “What personal data do we process?” for information about the personal data we process.
Anonymised data is data from which all identifiable elements have been removed, so that it is no longer possible to link that data to you as an individual.
Processing of personal data is any use of personal data, including collection, storage, editing, compiling, distributing and deleting.
Our “digital channels” include our website and other digital services, including blogs, e-mail subscriptions and the registration of information using forms.
2. How do we collect personal data?
The information we collect about you depends on which of our digital channels you use and what information you give us in connection with purchasing or registration or in other contexts.
We collect personal data that:
you disclose to us when you purchase or register for our services, subscribe to our newsletters and blogs, complete a form, or contact us.
is registered automatically when you use our digital channels.
You are not obligated to provide any personal data to us, but if you choose not to, we may not be able to provide our services to you, for instance because we cannot invoice you for the services or send you the information you request.
3. What personal data do we process?
We may process personal data within the following categories:
Basic information, such as name, employer, job title and contact information.
Information about the customer relationship, such as order details and payment information, marketing permissions, and contact with customer support.
Information generated in connection with the use of digital channels, such as technical information about the device that you use when you visit our digital channels (including the date and time; the type of PC/mobile device, operating system and browser you use; IP addresses; screen resolution, etc.). The section “Navigation information” below provides more detailed information.
Information relating to the identification and registration of a customer or user, such as information about a user’s identity.
Any other information that is stored on the basis of your consent. In such cases, when we request your consent we will give you specific information about what data we store and what it is used for.
Our digital channels are not intended for or aimed at children under the age of 13. We do not intentionally store information about children under the age of 13. If you believe we have stored data about a child under the age of 13, you may contact us in writing so that we can delete the data.
4. Navigation information
Cookies
We use cookies and similar technologies in our digital channels. Cookies help us to establish which parts of our digital channels are the most popular – for instance, which pages users visit, and the duration of each visit. This information is used for purposes such as the development and analysis of services and to target adverts on the Internet. You can read more about our use of cookies in section 9.
Log files
We automatically collect information about your device’s specifications and software and your visit to our website. This information may include your IP address, type of web browser, domain name, Internet service provider, files viewed (HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, access time and where you were referred to our digital channels from.
Tracking pixels
We use tracking pixels (also known as clear GIFs, web beacons or web bugs) to help us improve our digital channels by telling us which content has been shown. Tracking pixels are small graphical elements with a unique identifier, with a similar function to cookies, and are used to track user behaviour on the Internet. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard disk, tracking pixels are invisibly embedded in our digital channels or e-mails. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing. We link the information we gather from e-mails to customers’ personal information.
Advertising material
We may use third-party providers when we place adverts on the Internet. These companies use cookies and tracking pixels to collect information about your activities on this and other websites in order to offer you targeted advertising based on your interests. If you no longer wish to receive such information for the purpose of providing you with targeted advertising, you can opt out on http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will no longer see any advertising online – you will still be exposed to generic advertising.
5. How do we use your personal data?
We use the information that we store about you for the following purposes:
To provide services: We process personal data in order to perform and supply services to you. For example, your personal data is processed in connection with
supplying content when you request it, such as e-mails addressed to recipients who have subscribed to newsletters or blog updates,
customer identification,
invoicing and payment handling, and
error correction, customer service and complaints handling.
For development and analysis: We process personal data in order to improve and develop our services and digital channels.
For sales and marketing: We use both anonymised data and personal data for marketing purposes, such as
creating target audiences for marketing
adapting and directing marketing, such as by providing recommendations or targeted content via our digital channels
sending newsletters and other forms of direct marketing when permitted based on your consent or applicable legislation
marketing analyses, customer satisfaction surveys, etc.
“cleansing” contact information with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and other digital organisations so that we can communicate with you and other users through these channels
For data security and to prevent misuse of services: We may process personal data in order to ensure that our digital channels are secure. We may also process personal data to detect or prevent various types of misuse.
To comply with legislation: We process personal data to comply with our legal obligations, for example for accounting purposes and in order to provide information to competent authorities when we are required to do so by Norwegian law.
For other purposes with your consent: We may process your personal data for any other purpose for which you have specifically given us consent.
6. How do we protect your data?
Protecting your personal data is a high-priority duty for us, and we work constantly to protect personal data and other confidential information. Our security work includes taking physical, technical and administrative measures, including the protection of personnel, information, IT infrastructure, internal and external networks, and office buildings and technical facilities.
It also involves carrying out regular risk assessments and reviewing various factors such as available technology, business needs and legal requirements. We do this to ensure that we always have sufficient security measures in place, for instance to prevent personal data from falling into the wrong hands.
7. To whom do we supply your personal data?
We may provide personal data to:
Data processors who work for us as subcontractors and who process your data on our behalf. These subcontractors cannot use personal data for any purpose other than to perform the service agreed with us. We take special precautions to ensure that our subcontractors comply with these Terms and with Norwegian data protection legislation, and in particular where the data processor is located in a country outside Norway or the EU/EEA area.
Other parties with your consent.
We may also supply information:
In cases where we are required to do so by law, such as in response to court orders or as required by the police or other public authorities, in accordance with strict, predefined processes.
In connection with transfers of undertakings, for example as part of mergers, acquisitions, sales of our assets or the transfer of services to another company. In such cases you will be notified by e-mail and/or see a notification in our digital channels about any change in ownership, the use of your personal data and any choices you may have regarding your personal data.
8. How long do we store your data?
We will store your personal data for as long as necessary in order to fulfil the purposes stated in the Terms, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted in accordance with applicable legislation.
Personal data is stored for as long as you have an active relationship with us or our digital channels, or until you ask us to forget you and to delete stored information about you. We define a relationship with us or our digital channels as (i) being our customer, (ii) having consented to receiving marketing information from us, (iii) having actively requested contact with us via social media, electronic message or electronic form, or (iv) being active in our digital channels after you have given your consent. The relationship is defined as active if it has been exercised during the previous 24 months.
The storage of anonymised data is not subject to such restrictions or requirements. Furthermore, we endeavour to ensure that personal data and other customer information is kept up to date and accurate, and that we do not store information that is not required for the purposes of the processing of the personal data.
9. How do we use cookies?

Cookies help us to establish which parts of our digital channels are the most popular – for instance, which pages users visit, and the duration of each visit.
