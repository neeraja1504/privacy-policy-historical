About our site
WebsiteBuilderExpert.com (“ our site ”) is an online resource for technology and related news and information.
About us
Website Builder Expert is a brand of Marketing VF Limited (“ MVF ”, “ we ”, “ us ”, “ our ”).
MVF is a company registered in England and Wales (company number: 06951544), whose registered office address is at Imperial Works, Perren Street, London NW5 3ED, United Kingdom.
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “ GDPR ”), Marketing VF Limited is the controller in relation to your data. We are registered as a controller with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ ICO ”) under registration number Z1995728. You can confirm our registration here: www.ico.org.uk
What data we collect and how we use it
Subscribing to our newsletters, guides and deals:
You can subscribe to our newsletters, guides and deals (“ Emails ”) by completing and submitting the webform on our site. The webform will ask you for your email address.
If you subscribe, we will send you an email with a link, asking you to confirm your email address and subscription. If you click on the link, we will send our Emails to you periodically. At any time, you can unsubscribe from our Emails.
Posting comments:
If you wish to post any comments on our site, you will need to provide your name and email address. If we approve your comment, it will be posted on our site with the name you provide. Your email address will not be published, and is requested only to help us prevent spam.
Contacting us:
We will receive information about you (e.g. your name and email address) if you contact us through our site, or by email or post.
If you contact us, we will use your information to handle your enquiry and correspond with you.
Creating custom and lookalike/similar audiences:
We may work with Facebook and other platforms (“ Platforms ”) to reach out to you with adverts. We also like to use Platforms to reach out to other people who might like to use our sites and service.
We do this in two ways. In both cases, your data, along with other data, is used to create a custom audience and/or a lookalike/similar audience. Whenever an audience is shared with a Platform, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised, meaning that any data within the audience that could identify a person is replaced with an artificial identifier. So, the process is secure. Also, we don’t share more data than we need to for the purpose of creating the audience.
Custom audience – A custom audience is a list of existing users of our sites and service (“ Existing Users ”). From time to time, we share this with Platforms. As explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised. The Platform uses this audience to show our Existing Users our adverts.
Lookalike/similar audience – A lookalike/similar audience is an audience created by the Platform. From time to time, we share with Platforms a list of Existing Users. The Platform uses this list to find and create lookalikes – i.e. other Platform users who have similar characteristics to the Existing Users – to which it shows our adverts. Again, as explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised.
As we explain below, at any time, you may object to such activity by emailing us at dataprotection@mvfglobal.com.
Understanding and improving website conversions
We work with a click tracker to capture and store Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Every computer or device has an IP address - a unique number - which enables it to communicate with other computers and devices over the Internet. We store IP addresses in order to understand which countries our website conversions come from. We then use this data to optimise our campaigns, in order to improve our conversion rates.
Receiving data from our partners:
From time to time, our partners (i.e. website builders) may share data with us. In most cases, they do this anonymously (i.e. they don’t provide us with any personal data). If you visit Shopify’s site from our site, and subsequently open a Shopify account, they will tell us the name of your online store. We don’t use this information for any purpose, except to record the number of visitors from our site who have opened a Shopify account.
Working with suppliers:
We work with a number of suppliers, who process data on our behalf. These include cloud storage providers, email service providers, and cloud telephony providers. We have appropriate contracts in place with such suppliers to ensure the protection and confidentiality of data.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. At the bottom of this policy, we have included a table, setting out what cookies we use, and the purposes for which we use them.
Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org
To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Transferring your data
We may transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area (the “ EEA ”).
Some of those countries have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection.
Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the EU’s model contract clauses.
Storing your data
We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons.
We will keep your data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose/s for which it was collected in the first place, i.e. as set out in this notice.
