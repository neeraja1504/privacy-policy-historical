Data Processing Agreement
1. Data Processing Agreement
Up to date and Transparent Security Measures As a reliable web hosting provider and data processing company we have implemented the highest possible up-to-date security standards in order to provide adequate security measures for the data uploaded on our servers by our customers. WebHostFace shall implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. The Security Measures include measures to provide encrypted transmission of customer data outside the Service environment; to help ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of WebHostFace’s systems and services; to help restore timely access to Customer Data from an available backup copy, provided either by WebHostFace Backup Services or Customer’s own backup copy following an incident; and for regular testing of effectiveness. WebHostFace may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Services.Minimum Access Principle The DPA puts in writing our obligation to access any data that our customers store on our servers only to the extent needed to provide our services and to make sure only employees that are directly involved with the provision of the service have access to it. WebHostFace shall not access or use Customer Data, except as necessary to provide the Services and related technical support to the Customer in accordance with the DPA, the Agreement and other relevant policies.We Provide Access To Secure Partners Only Our partnering companies might need access to the data uploaded on our servers so that we can provide our service. Our data center partners are an example of such a partnering company. We provide access only to partners that have same or higher level of data protection as the one we guarantee you through our DPA. WebHostFace Partners may be retained as Sub-processors; and WebHostFace and WebHostFace Partners respectively may engage Sub-processors in connection with the provisioning of the Services. WebHostFace has entered into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations not less protective than those in this DPA with respect to the protection of Customer Data to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Sub-processors.Any Personal Data Breach Is Timely Disclosed Our DPA responsibilities include timely disclosure by WebHostFace, if a personal data breach is detected by us to have happened on the servers used by our clients. We are obliged to notify our affected customers within 72 hours.Any End User GDPR Requests Are Appropriately Passed On Also if WebHostFace receives a request by an individual, using a website hosted on our servers, to exercise one of the personal data rights outlined in the GDPR, we’ll redirect them to the site owner.Our DPA Helps You Become GDPR-Compliant Our new DPA does not make sites hosted by us GDPR compliant on its own. Our customers, as site owners, are solely responsible to apply the GDPR principles in processing their European users’ personal information. However, even if you have done your part on making your website GDPR compliant, it will not be fully there, unless your hosting provider has a DPA.
