We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely, including taking the following safeguards:
PCI DSS standards. We never request or hold your credit card or debit card details. Where you need to make a payment to a finance company using your credit card, we use the secure WorldPay portal which is fully compliant with PCI DSS standards. Our systems do not record any of the information entered into this portal.

Our data is held at a Tier II data centre with secure access controlled via 24 hr security, biometric access, internal & external CCTV & security breach alarms.

Methods of disposal. Paper documents are disposed of by shredding in a manner that ensures confidentiality.
Firewalls and Encryption. We use up-to-date and industry-standard firewall and encryption software technology.
Overseas transfers. Whenever we transfer your personal information outside the United Kingdom, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that we apply appropriate safeguards (either by transferring data only to recipients in the European Union, to recipients in countries approved by the European Commission, to recipients that are party to the EU-US Privacy Shield, or by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission).
If you are concerned about the levels of data security in any of those countries, please let us know and we will endeavour to advise what steps will be taken to protect your data when stored overseas.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
How long we will store your personal information
The length of time that we will store your data will depend on the ‘legal basis’ for why we are using that data, as follows:
