Webjet Marketing North America, LLC ("Webjet") is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains how Webjet collects and uses the personal information that you provide online to Webjet.com (the “Website”), as well as offline when communicating with our call center operators. This Policy does not cover any Webjet third party providers, distributors, or suppliers, which may or may not be subject to their own privacy policies.
You should read this Policy before you submit any personal information to us. By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree with the content of this Policy, you should refrain from using our Website.
WHO WE ARE
Webjet Marketing North America, LLC, which owns and operates this Website, is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 215 N Howard Ave, Suit 202, Tampa, Florida, 33606, United States.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED
In General.  We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Website or provide to us in some other manner. Personal information is data that identifies you, and includes (but is not limited to) your name, business or personal email address, physical address, direct telephone number, and credit card number. You are not obligated to provide us with any personal information, unless or until you choose to purchase a reservation, sign up for one of our e-mail newsletters or engage in other transactions on our Website. We strive to limit the type of personal information that we collect to information that helps us accomplish our goal of providing first-class services for the benefit of our existing and prospective customers.
Newsletter.  Webjet publishes hot travel and airfare deals to destinations using e-mail newsletters to subscribers of that service. Users can sign up for newsletters on our home page by providing their e-mail address and zip code. Customers that have purchased flights through Webjet will also be added to the newsletter database. This information will not be shared with third parties. At anytime, you can unsubscribe to Webjet newsletters through links on our home page. We reserve the right to limit the amount of subscribers to the newsletter.
Webjet reserves the right to send subscribers of the newsletter additional information relating to our service or products, including administrative messages and market research questionnaires, as long as you remain a subscriber to one of our newsletters.
Purchases.  In order to purchase travel and related services through our site, you must provide us with certain personal information such as your name, your credit card number and expiration date, your credit card billing address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the name or names of the person(s) traveling (if not you). We may also ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent traveler numbers. We require this information so that we can process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep you informed of each transaction's status. If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other than yourself, you will need to make sure that each of these other travelers agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us. For your convenience, we make certain information about your reservation available to you or other persons authorized by you to receive such information. For example, if you forgot your flight number, you or another person authorized by you may retrieve that information from us after providing information sufficient in our eyes to confirm your identity or that such other person is authorized by you to receive that information.
TSA Secure Flight.  Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable). You do not need to provide this information while making your trip reservation, but you must provide the information to your airline(s) sometime before your trip. If you provide date of birth, gender, or redress number during the booking process, we will not permanently store this personal information for any travelers, aside from the required entries in the air reservation record. We will not disclose this information to any third parties other than the applicable airline(s). If you are making a reservation for travelers other than yourself, you should make sure each traveler agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us.
Secure Flight is a federally mandated program set forth in the Secure Flight Final Rule , published in the Federal Register Volume 73, Number 209. The TSA privacy notice can be found in Section 1560.103 of the Secure Flight Final Rule :
The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires aircraft operators to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA’s Web site at www.tsa.gov.

Webjet may also share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials from Webjet and authorize a third party to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. We refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities." When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that Webjet may send your personal information (such as, in some cases, your mailing address or e-mail address) to the sponsor, and the sponsor may use your personal information in accordance with the sponsor's privacy practices.

Information Collected Automatically.  When you visit the Website, we automatically log generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the Internet. This information may consist of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by the user while on our Website. An IP address is a number that allows computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, to know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the Website the user wishes to view. We collect this information because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We may also use some of this information, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail messages focused on destinations that you may be interested in, unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages. We also use session data to help prevent fraud or unauthorized use of our site.
