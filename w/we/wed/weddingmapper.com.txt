SUMMARY
We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at [email protected] or in writing at: Privacy Director, Community Walk, 880 Lombard Street, San Francisco, CA 94133.
Online Privacy Standards. While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the Internet, we look to the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles for guidance, currently available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/tos.htm.
What This Policy Covers. This policy covers Wedding Mapper's treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address.

All of these sites operate independently of Wedding Mapper and they may have their own privacy or security practices. We encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.
