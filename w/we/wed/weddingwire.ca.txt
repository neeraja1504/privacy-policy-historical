Last Revised October 27, 2013
PRIVACY POLICY
WeddingWire, Inc. ("Company", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors to its Web site, WeddingWire.com ("Site"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information, Automatically Gathered Information and Anonymous Information (each defined below) you submit to us or which we gather when you visit our Site. This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated in our Terms of Use Agreement, and by registering for a User Account on the Site you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 13, 2009.
This Privacy Policy applies to ALL users, including those just visiting this Site ("Users").
"Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, email address or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. "Automatically Gathered Information" is information we collect as you visit our site. See "Automatically Gathered Information" below for more information.
CONSENT
By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy by us or by third parties with whom we have a relationship. Your Personal Information may be processed by WeddingWire in the country where it was collected, as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. In addition, in the event you contact WeddingWire via telephone, you understand, acknowledge and agree that such phone conversations may be recorded.
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our Services and Site change and expand. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may email announcements, introduce pop-up notifications, or otherwise notify you through other means. Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Once any changes that we make to this Privacy Policy become effective, your continued use of the Site after such time will signify your acceptance of the new terms.
INFORMATION WE GATHER
Registration
If you register with the Site, we collect and store Personal Information that specifically identifies you or the account you set up with Wedding Wire (your "Account"). At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is your first name, last name, User ID, password, preferred currency, street address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, phone number, email address and valid financial account (i.e. credit card) information. Other information requested on our Registration page is optional. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you to help us tailor the Site for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement Personal Information you provide us with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, if you add a vendor to your planning tools, or provide a review of a new vendor, we will automatically add that vendor's information to our catalog (without any link back to you).
Password
Use of portions of the Site requires you to establish a User ID and password. You agree that you will be responsible for maintaining your password as confidential and for any activity that occurs on your Account as a result of you sharing your password with another or failing to protect it. WeddingWire is not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your password.
Online Surveys and Contests
Occasionally, WeddingWire may conduct User surveys to collect information about our Users' preferences. These surveys are optional, and if you choose to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. These surveys may be conducted by and processed through third parties. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. Except with respect to any survey partners, none of the survey results are shared with third parties in a personally identifiable form. The demographic information that WeddingWire collects in the registration process and through surveys may be used to help us improve our Services and Site to meet the needs and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising to you about our Services and Site. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.
User-Submitted Information
WeddingWire reserves the right to retain any and all information submitted by Users through use of the Site, including but not limited to reviews, public profile information, information submitted to surveys (created by us or any other third party), personal messages sent through the Site, and posts to message boards or forums. We may supplement Personal Information you provide us with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes.
Automatically Gathered Information
WeddingWire automatically collects information including but not limited to browser type, browser software version, IP address, location information, and other information that may personally identify you. We reserve the right to collect and manage this information at our discretion. We may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to conduct research and analytics, to maintain records of Users' activities on our Site, to manage use of our Site and Site services (including third party services), to customize and improve your user experience, and as deemed necessary for additional Site management purposes. Additionally, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or to protect our service, Site, customers, vendors, or others.
Email to Friends Feature and Referral Program
WeddingWire lets you easily connect your Profiles to friends/affiliates via email. WeddingWire also offers the ability to send friends/affiliates emails to WeddingWire. If you choose to use either feature, we will use your email address to copy you on the message or to send on the email your behalf, and you hereby grant permission for such use.
Public Information
As part of registration, you may set up a Profile describing yourself, your wedding (My Profile) or your business (Storefront). This profile will be publicly available as a default. You will have the ability to hide Personal Information under your Profile Settings. Once you choose to hide your profile, it may take some time for the search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, etc.) to cycle out their cached search results which may temporarily contain your Personal Information. WeddingWire does not have direct control over the timeliness of this process. WeddingWire will not have any obligation under this Privacy Policy with respect to information in your Profile or information you voluntarily provide to other Users via the Site.
HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION

We may use your information (including Personal Information and Automatically Gathered Information) for our own internal purposes, including but not limited to contacting you via email to inform you about updates to our Services and providing you with information relating to e-commerce transactions that you conduct on the Site. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law. We also reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information as part of a transfer of all or part of WeddingWire's assets to a buyer, as described in "Acquisition," below.

If you consent to giving your information to a third party, the third party's use of the information is subject to the third party's privacy policy.

The WeddingWire Vendor Review system represents a central repository for ratings and reviews of wedding vendors by their customers (engaged couples or married couples). When you submit a review or a counter-review on the WeddingWire Site, your WeddingWire Profile information will be made available as part of the review posting. If you provide a review for a vendor that is not yet part of our catalog, or if you add a new vendor to your planning tools, we will use the information that you provide about the vendor to notify the vendor that a review has been completed and that we are adding the vendor to our catalog. We will also seek that vendor's greater involvement with our Site. You have the option to hide your profile under a unique WeddingWire screen name.
WeddingWire Vendor Catalog
The WeddingWire Catalog provides a listing by sortable category/fields of participating WeddingWire Vendors as well as a listing of local businesses. If a WeddingWire Vendor is registered, the vendor's Storefront will be made available on the Catalog unless the vendor chooses to unregister from the Site. As specified in our Terms of Use, after WeddingWire and the Vendor Member have terminated their relationship, WeddingWire shall be entitled to retain all reviews associated with a Vendor Member on the Site as well as basic directory information, including, without limitation, business name, address and telephone number.
