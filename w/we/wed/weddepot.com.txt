Third-Party Sites
Please be aware that other web sites that may be accessed through our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party web sites linked to WedDepot.com.com are not covered by this privacy statement. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Children's Privacy
WedDepot.com takes children's privacy seriously. WedDepot.com does not seek to collect personal information about children through its Web site. Like other operators of Web sites for children, WedDepot.com is prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in an activity disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If a child submits information to us through any part of our Web site and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete such information that we collect inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. In the odd event that a parent requests review or deletion of information about a kid before we have discovered and deleted the information, then we will of course honor that request.
