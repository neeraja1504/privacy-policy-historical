Lawful basis for Processing Personal Data: In processing your Personal Data in connection with the purposes set out in this policy, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases, depending on the circumstances:

We have a legitimate interest in carrying out the Processing for the purpose of managing, operating or promoting our business, and that legitimate interest is not overridden by your interest, fundamental rights or freedoms.
Our legitimate interest and your right to object:  Legitimate Interest means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service, content and offers.
For example, we have an interest in making sure our content and offers are relevant to you, so we may process your information to send you newsletters, marketing offers and partner promotions that are tailored to your specialist interests.
When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests in our specialist content and offers – we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law.
