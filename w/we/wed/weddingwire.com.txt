By accepting our Terms of Use Agreement, or by registering for a User Account on the Site you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to ALL users of the Site, including both registered and unregistered users and visitors, ("Users"). "Event Users" are Users, who are brides, grooms, newlyweds and others using the site for planning a wedding or event. "Vendor Users" are Users who are vendors who provide services in the event industry. "Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, email address or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
Users of the sites and applications that are part of the Site may be able to adjust the manner or amount of information that is publicly disclosed or shared with third parties by adjusting privacy settings (the "Privacy Settings") within those sites or applications. These include, without limitation:
- For the WeddingWire.com (both desktop and mobile) Web sites (the "WW Sites") and the WeddingWire mobile application (the "WW App") and WedTeam mobile application (the "WedTeam App"), collectively with the WW Sites and the WW App, the "WW Properties"), the settings found here http://www.weddingwire.com/wedding/UserProfileSettings (the "WW Privacy Settings") will allow you to modify the display and sharing of certain information. Additionally, the WW App allows you to make certain modifications to display and sharing of information within the WWP Properties in the "Settings" section of the WW App.

Your Personal Information may be processed by WeddingWire in the country where it was collected, as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. In addition, in the event you contact WeddingWire via telephone, you understand, acknowledge and agree that such phone conversations may be recorded.
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES
