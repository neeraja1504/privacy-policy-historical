Wedding By Color - Free Wedding Blogs & Brides' Online Community
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Tov Solutions we have a few fundamental principles:
We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
Weddingbycolor.com is one of the websites operated by Tov Solutions Inc. ("Tov Solutions"). It is Tov Solutions's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Tov Solutions collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tov Solutions's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tov Solutions's visitors use its website. From time to time, Tov Solutions may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Tov Solutions also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Tov Solutions does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Tov Solutions's websites choose to interact with Tov Solutions in ways that require Tov Solutions to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tov Solutions gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at weddingbycolor.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Tov Solutions â€“ by purchasing vendor's listing service, for example â€“ are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Tov Solutions collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Tov Solutions. Tov Solutions does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Tov Solutions may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Tov Solutions may monitor the most popular blogs on the Weddingbycolor.com site. Tov Solutions may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Tov Solutions does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Tov Solutions discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tov Solutions's behalf or to provide services available at Tov Solutions's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tov Solutions's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tov Solutions will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tov Solutions discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Tov Solutions believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tov Solutions, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Tov Solutions website and have supplied your email address, Tov Solutions may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Tov Solutions and our partners. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tov Solutions takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
