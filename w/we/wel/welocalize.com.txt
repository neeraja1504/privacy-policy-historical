why we collect personal information
Welocalize collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, special offers, and other information we think you’d like to hear about. This may occasionally include information about products and services that can add value to your globalization strategy. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.
how we collect personal information
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to request service, participate in an online survey, or ask to be included in an email mailing list. We store the information you provide in a secure database.
when we disclose personal information
At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. At any other time, if we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
