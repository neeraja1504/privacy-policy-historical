Privacy policy and Copyright - Well House Consultants
Personal and company information entered onto forms on this web site, and sent to us in email, or provided to us in any other way will be used only by Well House Consultants and will not be disclosed to third parties (except if required by law - for example in a police investigation). This means that you will not receive mailings from other companies as a result of being on our mailing list, and that your course reviews are between yourself and Well House Consultants only.
We accept credit card payment for courses by phone, fax, or in person. We also have a secure data page through which you can give us credit card and other sensitive information. For your own security, we request that you do NOT send us credit card details by email. We have chosen not to offer online booking facilities for courses, as we want to discuss your requirements individually with you to ensure that what you're booking is appropriate.
We make very limited use of cookies on our site (to record which part of the world you're in if you change your location, to record the font settings you choose through our accessability options, in the cat or dog demonstration, and in the Regular Expression Mouse Mat area). We check our web access logs to ensure the continuing integrity of our web sites, and we use the limited marketing information that the logs provide within our company. We do accept on line credit cards payments for purchases of mouse mats and pens, but only though our secure server.
We do not retain your credit card details in a database once payment has been taken. That applies to online orders and also if you phone or fax your details in. You'll be asked for new details each time you pay by credit card.
We provide you with a certificate of completion at the end of each course; please note that this is not a certificate that you've achieved any particular standard in the subject being taught. We do not provide employers with an evaluation of any individual student on our courses, unless the request has been made prior to the course and the student(s) concerned are aware of and have agreed to the request.
We are registered with the Data Protection Commissioner under the Data Protection Act, 1998.
