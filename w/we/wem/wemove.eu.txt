From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by reporting on trends in the usage of our websites.
We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors and do not disclose such information to any third parties.

In some special cases, where the information about where you are located (e.g. electoral district) would be relevant to the goal of the campaign, we might also share your city or postcode with the petition target.
If you participate in a campaign, we may ask you if we may share your email address with the initiator of the campaign or with our partner organisation. If you agree, we will share your email address.
