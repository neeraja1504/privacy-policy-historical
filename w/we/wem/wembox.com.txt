PRIVACY POLICY
At WemBox® we are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our Internet users. This document outlines the management of any/all information provided to us by our users. We have two types of users: registered and non-registered. Registered users have filled out one or more forms providing us with information, usually in order to list a web site in our directory, and/or subscribe to our free services. Non-registered users have never filled out a form on our site, nor provided us directly with any information.
All Users
During the process of delivering a web page to you, we do NOT collect any personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, the web server logs the following connection information: 1) The IP (Internet) Address of your Internet Service Provider, 2) The date and time of your connection, 3) The document or image that was viewed, 4) Your browser type i.e. Netscape or Explorer, 5) Your operating system type i.e. Windows XP or MacOS, and 6) The page or site that referred you to ours.
The information from our web server logs is aggregated and analyzed to assist us in determining: 1) Total Traffic to our site, 2) Popular documents and search queries, 3) Proper load balancing to maximize our bandwidth and computer assets, and 4) Site compatibility with different browser versions. Service Provider data is analyzed geographically to determine the percentage of users accessing us from United States and other parts of the world.
This site contains links to other sites. WemBox® is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of web sites to which we link.
Registered Users
Registered users are those that provide us with personal and/or corporate information. At present, this occurs at the moment of 1) registering a web site for inclusion in our directory/search engine.
All personal information is for our internal use only, unless the user requests otherwise. The user registering his website may choose to have his e-mail address and/or name printed in his directory record. The default in all our data entry forms is to keep personal e-mails and names private.
Because of the nature of our services, we assume that users registering a business website wish to make public corporate information such as address, telephone, and fax numbers. Except for the city and state, it is not a requirement to enter this information in order to be listed in our directory. WE STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT NON-COMMERCIAL USERS DO NOT LIST PERSONAL TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES.
Registered users can edit or delete the website information that appears in our directory by using this form and the password chosen at initial registration.
We do not sell the lists of our registered users. Period.
For those users that choose to list their e-mail addresses, we take several steps to protect their addresses from e-mail spammers; however, these steps can never be 100% effective.
This document is under development. Other documents intended to define our privacy statements will be available soon.
