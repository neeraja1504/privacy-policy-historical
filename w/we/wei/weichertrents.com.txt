Weichert.com: About Us: Privacy Policy
Weichert, Realtors and the affiliated companies of Weichert (“Weichert” or “we”) recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information collected about our customers and potential customers. This Privacy Policy was created in order to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our customers' privacy.
Weichert may gather information from a variety of ways, including, loan applications submitted by potential borrowers, forms requesting additional information about a property, product or a service provided by Weichert. Weichert also learns of statistical patterns that show preferences for certain properties, market areas and services. This type of information is used to offer better services to the users of the Weichert web site. For instance, we may use statistical information to develop better tools to assist home sellers in marketing their homes to specific buyers interested in properties that meet their requirements.
Personally Identifiable Information Collected. Depending on the products and services you are interested in we may collect personally identifiable information such as (i) your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, assets, employment and income; (ii) data based on your experiences with us, with other Weichert affiliates, and with other service providers, such as your payment history, transaction parties, insurance policy coverage and premium amount, and (iii) information from consumer reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness and credit history. We maintain strict physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect all personal nonpublic information. We restrict access to this information to only those persons who need to know it in order to provide you with products or services.

We believe that children under the age of 18 should obtain permission from their parents before providing any personal information to us via this website.

Weichert may share certain information regarding our customers and former customers among Weichert affiliates only in accordance with our strict security standards and confidentiality policies, and applicable laws. We hold our employees and agents fully accountable for adhering to these standards, policies and laws.
From time to time opportunities arise that we believe will benefit our customers and former customers. On a selective basis, we may share your name, address, telephone number and email address with third parties, such as insurance agencies, home warranty companies and tax service providers, record storage companies, moving companies, and other businesses that provide services to home owners, to market financial and non-financial products and services that may interest you. We will only provide this information to companies making these offers available to you under strict confidentiality agreements. For instance, we may share certain information with our strategic business partners with whom we have agreements to help provide customers with Weichert One Stop Shopping Services, or with other companies which help us to conduct business, such as credit bureaus and businesses which provide account maintenance, analysis and servicing. We may also provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law.
