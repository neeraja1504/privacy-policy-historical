(2) Automate certain areas of the West Coast University websites or online forms.
(3) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing the West Coast University website is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.

How does West Coast University use my information?
West Coast University's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our websites. This includes personalization services and interactive communications, which are completely free to you.
West Coast University does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, or from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
With whom does West Coast University share my information?
West Coast University will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission. West Coast University may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating West Coast University's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) West Coast University's rights or property, other West Coast University users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. West Coast University may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
West Coast University does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.
How does West Coast University secure my information?
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to provide you with the service requested have access to your information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
How could my submitted information be corrected or what do I do if I have concerns over misuse of my personal data?
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number provided on our website:
See what data we have about you, if any.
Change/correct any data we have about you.
Have us delete any data we have about you.
Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
How will I be notified of any privacy policy changes?
If a substantial privacy notice revision occurs, you will be notified by the university and the new privacy statement will be available for review.
What else should I know about my privacy?
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in instant message or chat areas - that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, West Coast University cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
