We collect information on the Site at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information (such as domain name or IP address) from all visitors to the Site. This type of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of the Site.
Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable information when you use the services available on the Site. For example, your use of your username and password allows us to identify you as our Associate. On some of our Sites, you can order products or services, make requests and register to receive materials. The types of personal information that may be collected on these pages are name, user name, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information.
We do collect "cookies" to store your preferences and record session information, such as items you add to your shopping cart.

If you want to disable these cookies, most Internet Browsers will allow you to delete cookies from your computer hard drive, prevent them from being stored or signal a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

USE OF AGGREGATE INFORMATION
We store information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users. Log files record Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

BUSINESS TRANSFERS
In the event we go through a business transition or a transfer, our users’ personal information may be part of the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
LINKS
We may at times provide links to other websites. These sites are not controlled by us and we are not responsible for any content contained on any such website.

We recommend that you review the privacy and security policies of each website you visit. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site.
SECURITY
Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. If you register with us, your online account information is protected by a password chosen by you. Access to that online account requires your username and password. We recommend that you do not disclose your username and password to any other person. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use the latest in encryption technology when collecting or transferring sensitive data, such as credit card and bank account information.
We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your information. However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
We also make an effort to protect your information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment.
When registering for access to a secure area of the Site, we will ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing your computer.
