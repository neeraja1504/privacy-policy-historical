Privacy
We NEVER reveal any personally identifiable information about you. Your information is just that – yours! WeShop keeps your information completely secure. We don't reveal it to anyone without your permission.
This privacy statement describes how WeShop collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web site: http://www.weshop.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
WeShop has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at info@weshop.com or you can contact TRUSTe here. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.
Transparency
Whatever shopping data WeShop collects from you, you'll see. Anytime WeShop collects shopping data from you, you'll see it when you log in to your account. Shopping-based data is the only data WeShop's systems collect from a connected email address. That's it.
Authority
WeShop gives you the tools to take control of your purchasing information, and benefit from it! Details about the things you buy – clothes, food, music, tickets – are valuable to merchants and marketers to make you offers. WeShop believes this information is YOURS and yours alone. You should control it and how it is used. Access to your information should be on your terms and you should benefit by getting great offers in return for the things you want at the prices you want to pay. In addition, you should be able to share information about your purchases with other consumers, so you can find out where they bought the things you want and what they paid for them. In this way consumers can learn from each other where the great deals are, and what products and services are in demand, without constantly being pitched by merchants.
