Privacy Policy
WeArticles.com® – PRIVACY POLICY
[Effective as of November 1st, 2013]
Address: WeArticles®, Los Angeles, CA 90046.
WeArticles® (“WeArticles,”
WeArticles.COM,” ) is deeply committed to respecting and protecting
the privacy and security rights of users and the information you share with us at the WeArticles website
(the “Website”). WeArticles created this Privacy Policy to give you (“You” or “Your”) assurance of
WeArticles’s commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of Your privacy as You
visit and use the Website (the “Privacy Policy”).
We believe YOU have the right to know everything regarding the information we collect about

information. This Privacy Policy explains what we do with your information and what You can
expect from WeArticles. By using the Website, You indicate your acceptance of WeArticles’s Privacy Policy.
WeArticles’s data collection and retention practices are designed to provide transparency,
accountability and choice regarding the management and use of Your personal information
(“Personal Information”). If You have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy
or practices, please contact us at via e-mail at " admin@WeArticles.com. This Privacy
Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any websites of third-parties (“Third-Party

materially from this Privacy Policy. You should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as
WeArticles has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third-parties.

1. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
We care about the safety of children. WeArticles does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal
Information from children under the age of 13. Children should always get permission from
their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as, their names, e-
mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage
You to become involved in Your children’s on-line experience and to share Your interest in our
Website with Your young ones. If WeArticles obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal
Information from a child under the age of 13, WeArticles will immediately delete such information
from its database.
2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES
WeArticles collects Personal Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information
to us on the Website and through e-mail. When visiting the Website, we collect user-specific
information on what pages are visited.
Personal Information
When You register for our service, You will be asked to provide WeArticles certain Personal
Information. Personal Information includes, without limitation: Your first name, last
name, user-name, password, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, city, state, and zip
code. The Website will not gather Personal Information surreptitiously.
In general, once You provide us with Your required Personal Information, You are no
longer anonymous. In providing us with Your Personal Information, You consent to
the transfer and storage of such information on our servers. In addition to the foregoing
Personal Information in connection with your registration and use of WeArticles, we may
collect and store the following Personal Information:
• all transactional information based on your activities on WeArticles;
• any correspondence sent to us; and
• other supplemental information from third-parties.
Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide You with a safe,
smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use Your Personal
Information to:
provide the services and customer support You request;
resolve disputes;
troubleshoot problems;
prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;
enforce our Terms and Conditions;
customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising; and
inform you about our services, targeted marketing, service updates, and
promotional offers.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect Your privacy and our ability to
keep the community free from bad actors, WeArticles will maintain an e-mail database,
in-house, and will never sell Your data, to include postal and/or e-mail address(es).
Further, we will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information to law enforcement,
other government officials, or other third-parties without a subpoena, court order or
substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the
disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial
loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
Traffic Data
Like most website operators, WeArticles automatically gathers information of the sort that
browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers;
(iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing
the Website (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that
does not personally identify You.
Cookies
WeArticles uses so-called “Cookies,” which are files that are stored on Your computer that
can be retrieved to assist in customizing Your experience with the online service.
A “Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and
that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the
website. The purpose of a “Cookie” is to (1) support the functionality of the Website,
for example by keeping track of Your visual preferences or controlling the frequency
of “WeArticles-up” windows, and (2) identify the user as a unique user of the Website.
WeArticles uses “Cookies” to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to
ensure that You do not repeatedly see content or informational messages that may be of
no interest to You, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each
time You visit the Website.
If You want to disable “Cookies,” there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers
that allows You to turn-off “Cookies.” Please remember, however, that “Cookies” may
be required to allow You to use certain features of the Website.
For additional information on WeArticles’s uses of “Cookies,” see the section concerning
Information Use and Disclosure Practices, below.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE “COOKIES” PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER,
YOU SHOULD ADJUST THE CORRESPONDING SETTING IN YOUR BROWSER
TO REFUSE “COOKIES” BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN
FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT
THE AID OF “COOKIES.” IF YOU REFUSE “COOKIES,” YOU ASSUME ALL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs
WeArticles utilizes a software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),
that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to “Cookies,” and
are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to “Cookies,” which
are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web
pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the
information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s Personal Information. Rather, we
use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened
by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and
the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Some of our Third-Party Websites (e.g., Third-Party Advertising Promotions) use “Cookies” and
Web Beacons on the Website. We have no access to or control over these third-party tracking
technologies.
You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to
do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services.
3. INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES
(a) Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using “Cookies”
WeArticles analyzes Traffic Data and information gathered using “Cookies” to help WeArticles better
understand who is using the Website and how they are using it. By identifying patterns and
trends in usage, WeArticles is able to better design the Website to improve Your experience, and to
serve You more relevant and interesting content and third-party advertising promotions. From
time to time, WeArticles may release Traffic Data and information gathered using “Cookies” in the
aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. WeArticles does not
attempt to link information gathered using “Cookies” to Personal Information.
(b) Personal Information
Generally, WeArticles uses Your Personal Information to send You information about WeArticles and WeArticles’s-
products and services, and to contact You when necessary in connection with the Services.
WeArticles uses Your Demographic Data to customize and tailor Your experience on the Website.
Except under the following circumstances, WeArticles will keep Your Personal Information private,
and will not share it with third-parties.
Third-Party Marketing: By submitting Your Personal Information
to us and opting-in, You grant us the right, subject to applicable
state and federal law, to use that Personal Information for marketing
purposes. We may rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all
Personal Information with or to any third-party for any and all uses
permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. These third-
parties may include: (a) providers of the products and/or service that
you requested and/or won by and through our Website; (b) providers
of direct marketing services and applications; (c) e-mail marketers;
(d) telemarketers; and (e) direct marketers; and
WeArticles discloses Personal Information to those who help it provide services,
including those who perform technical, administrative and data processing
tasks such as hosting, fulfillment, and data storage and security. These
service providers are prohibited from using this Personal Information for
any other purpose including their own marketing purposes; and
WeArticles discloses Personal Information when required to do so by law, or in
response to a subpoena or court order, or when WeArticles believes in its sole
discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
rights of WeArticles, third-parties, or the public at large; and
WeArticles reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its
possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger,
acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of WeArticles’s assets.
Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use
and disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to
this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if You are given notice
of that new privacy policy and an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of
it. Personal Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however,
may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by a WeArticles successor
organization.
(c) Opting-In
WeArticles does not share Personal Information with anyone, unless You “opt in” to having Your
information shared with third-parties, or we have informed You of a change to our Privacy
Policy so that You can then choose to opt-out. It’s that simple.
If you have opted-in to receiving information from third-parties, we will provide You with a way
to tell us that You no longer want us to share Personal Information and that You no longer want
to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, and offerings
from any third-parties. We will also provide You with a way to update the Personal Information
that You share with us during registration. Once You have “opted-in” and agreed that Your
information may be shared with third-parties or You have responded directly to an offer by
any third-party on the WeArticles Website, WeArticles will not be able to update any of Your Personal
Information that has been transferred to such third-parties or opt You out of such third-parties
so that You no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, You
must either contact that third-party or refer to their individual privacy policy to update Your
Personal Information, or to let them know that You no longer want to receive promotional and/or
marketing information about their products, services, or offerings.
4. CONSENT TO RECEIVE E-MAIL FROM WeArticles
By establishing an account with WeArticles, You consent to receive periodic commercial/promotional
e-mail communications from WeArticles concerning WeArticles – products and services. You may opt-out
of receiving such communications at any time by (a) following the unsubscribe instructions
contained in each e-mail; (b) sending an e-mail to   " admin@WeArticles.com; (c)
writing to us at :  Los Angeles, CA 90046.
5. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
WeArticles has implemented and maintains generally accepted industry standards to protect against the
unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of Your Personal Information
both during transmission and once we receive it. The security of Your personal information
is important to us. When you enter sensitive information during the registration process, we
encrypt that information using state-of-the-art technology.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your
personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
WeArticles assures you that we will use Your e-mail address, with Your express consent, only for the
purposes stated in the Terms of Use. We will not otherwise rent or sell Your e-mail address
to third-parties, and we will prevent Your e-mail address from being recorded by “web
crawlers” or “web spiders” to the best of our ability. If You believe that your e-mail address
has been recorded in this way, please let us know immediately.
If You have any questions about security on our Website, You can e-mail us at
"mail to: admin@WeArticles.com."
6. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
The Website includes links to other Third-Party Websites whose privacy practices may differ
from those of WeArticles. If You submit Personal Information to any of a Third-Party Website, your
Personal Information is governed by their privacy statements. WeArticles encourages You to carefully
read the privacy statement of any Third-Party Website You visit.
7. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
WeArticles wants Your Personal Information to be complete and accurate. By using the Website, You
represent and warrant that all information You provide on any registration form or otherwise
in connection with Your use of the Website and Services will be complete and accurate, and
that You will update that information as necessary to maintain its completeness and accuracy.
To confirm the completeness and accuracy of, or make changes to, Your Personal
Information, please email us at   "mail to:" admin@WeArticles.com.
8. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES
From time to time, WeArticles may conduct contests, giveaways and other promotions
(collectively, “Promotional Activities”). Any information submitted in connection with
Promotional Activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time,
WeArticles may also ask You to participate in surveys designed to help WeArticles improve the Website or
services. Any Personal Information provided to WeArticles in connection with any survey will be
used only in relation to that survey, and may be disclosed to third-parties not bound by this
Privacy Policy only in aggregated form.
9. RULES FOR SUBMISSIONS AND MESSAGES IN CHAT ROOMS
If You use a bulletin board or chat room on the Website, You should be aware that any Personal
Information that You submit there can be read, collected and/or used by other users of those
forums, and could be used to send You unsolicited messages. Responsibility for what is posted
in the discussion groups or other public forums lies with each user – You alone are responsible
for the content of Your messages and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do
not review every submission a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or
propriety of any submission. We do, however, reserve the right but do not assume the obligation
to restrict or prohibit Your use of our Website if we believe you are violating any of the terms of
the agreement and to remove, edit, or relocate any submission as we see fit whether for legal or
other reasons.
We are not responsible for the Personal Information that You choose to submit in the Website
forums. We reserve the right to terminate the member status of anyone who uses the forums in a
manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.
10. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the
home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right
to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material
changes to this policy, we will notify You here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home
page within thirty (30) days of such changes being made.
11. REVOKING CONSENT/DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT

our General Terms of Use. As a rule it takes two to three business days until Your Personal
Information is completely removed from all records.
You can access, review and change most of Your Personal Information by logging on to WeArticles at
any time. However, some of your Personal Information can only be changed by contacting our
Customer Service at  admin@WeArticles.com. You are required to promptly update your
Personal Information if changes occur or information is inaccurate.

14. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third-parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third-parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
