What is "personal data"?
Under the GDPR "personal data" is defined as:
"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person".
As a result, "personal data" includes, amongst many other things, your name, address, phone number, email address and any other information that could be used to identify you, either by itself, or together with other information. It can also include other less obvious identifiers, such as your IP address and cookie data.
What personal data of mine will We Are Social collect when I use this Website?
By using this Website:
we may collect personal data that you provide to us by completing forms on this Website. It is difficult to say what this may be, however, it may include things such as your name (including title), address, phone number, date of birth, email address, job title and company details. In any event, the precise personal data that we collect from you will be clear to you as you complete the relevant form, as we will only collect the personal data that you submit to us and which will be specifically requested (i.e. you will be specifically invited to enter your name, email address etc.). In certain circumstances, certain data fields will be marked with an asterisk (i.e. *), which means that we require this personal data to be provided. To the extent that fields are not marked with an asterisk, then we do not require this personal data, but should you submit it to us then we will automatically collect it;
we may collect personal data that may be included in CVs, covering letter or other materials uploaded and/or sent to us via our Website;
we may collect personal data that you provide to us when you communicate with us for any reason. Once again, it is difficult to say what personal data this may be, but we will collect all of the information that is contained within your communication and, as this is within your control, you will be able to identify what this is. However, by way of example, if you communicate with us by email, we will collect your email address as a minimum;
you will automatically download a 'cookie' (you can read more about "cookies" below); and
we will automatically collect your IP address.
