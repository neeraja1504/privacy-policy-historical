Last revision date: Nov 30, 2010
www.WealthCreatorsUniversity.com has reviewed and rewritten its Privacy Policy to (1) make it easier to read and understand, (2) describe its practices in better detail, (3) make it clear that we may combine or share the information we hold across all current or future the Dr Hannes Dreyer’s Wealth Creators Club community, and (4) combine privacy policies and practices for the Dr Hannes Dreyer’s Wealth Creators Club retail stores and its affiliates. Instead of having multiple and potentially conflicting privacy policies for the Dr Hannes Dreyer’s Wealth Creators Club entities and our Web sites, we have decided to ensure all the Dr Hannes Dreyer’s Wealth Creators Club entities operations follow the same privacy standards. By combining our privacy policies and practices, we give our customers the same privacy standards whether providing the Dr Hannes Dreyer’s Wealth Creators Club personal information on or offline. If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, email our Privacy Manager at webservices@WealthCreatorsUniversity.com.
