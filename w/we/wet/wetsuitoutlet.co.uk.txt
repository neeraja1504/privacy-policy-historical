Analytics Tools
Google Analytics is a system used by many websites to record information about visits to their website. Google set six different cookies with expiry dates ranging from 30 minutes to 2 years. These cookies are used mainly to differentiate between first time visitors to a website and repeat visitors. They also allow us to ensure our website performs as well as possible for our users. The cookies can collect an anonymous customer number when a user is signed into the website, allowing our backend systems to ensure accuracy of Google Analytics data and help us ensure your website experience remains relevant across devices. They do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find out more about how Google use cookies at http://www.google.co.uk/policies/privacy/ (English only). These cookies may be used to help us target advertising on platform providers such as Google and Facebook.
Wetsuit Outlet may from time to time share your details with third party analytical resources for the purposes of better understanding of customer behaviour and performance, website performance, improved ad relevance and any other analytical process to give Wetsuit Outlet a better understanding of how to develop its offering to its customers. These third parties will be employed solely for the aforementioned analytical purposes, and as such Wetsuit Outlet will ensure that the third party is contractually obliged to use the data only for the analytical purposes set out in the agreement between Wetsuit Outlet and the third party, and Wetsuit Outlet will also ensure that the third party is contractually required to maintain a level of security around the shared data, at least as safe as Wetsuit Outlet itself employs. Failure on the part of the third party to meet its contractual obligations will result in Wetsuit Outlet recovering the data and taking all reasonable actions to ensure the third party no longer has access to the shared data. Any third party cookies used on Wetsuit Outlet will adhere to the same standards as first party cookies and not collect any personally identifiable information.
