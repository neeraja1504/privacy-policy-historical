Payments using third party payment processors - Stripe and eWAY
3.11  We use third party payment processors to assist in securely processing your personally identifiable payment information. Payments are currently processed and managed using Stripe and eWAY.
3.12  Stripe and eWAY’s use of your personal information is governed by their respective privacy policies, which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as our Privacy Policy. We have no control over and are not responsible for those privacy policies. A copy of Stripe and eWAY’s terms of service and privacy policies can be found here and we encourage you to read them:

3.13  If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, Stripe and E-Way stores your credit card data. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction or where you elect, your periodic purchase transactions. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
3.14  Where you elect for periodic purchase transactions:
(a)  you will have requested we make automatic periodic payments (ie more than one transaction) using the payment details you provided us during an initial relevant transaction;
(b)  your credit card data will be stored by our third party payment processors and used by them periodically to process payments; and
(c)  we will use reasonable endeavors to remind of your request for periodic payments prior to those payments being processed.
By way of example, you may wish to attend music classes which are held on a fortnightly basis. Instead of paying for a month of classes in advance, you may request to be billed for these classes on a fortnightly basis. Your request to be billed in this way is a request for periodic purchase transactions.
3.15  All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption. All transactions are encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ( PCI-DSS ).
3.16  All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
3.17  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our website and its service providers.
