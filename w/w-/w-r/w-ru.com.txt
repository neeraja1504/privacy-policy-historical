9. In how far is there an automised decision-making-process on my behalf?
Reply rate
The reply rate (i.e. the percentage of first letters received which you choose to reply to) is a fully-automised decision-making process and so is the quota of profiles you view or the number of times a user’s profile has been viewed him- or herself. Our website uses a simple algorithm and automated calculations to perform this task, in order to provide an immediate figure on your reply rate.
Matches
Matchmaking, in accordance with your own settings and the optional and entirely voluntary psychological test is also based on an automised decision-making process. You see your matches in general, matches online, new matches and updated matches in exact accordance with your own preferences (as per personal settings) which are fed into the system. The system then compares your and preferences to the corresponding settings and preferences in the opposite sex (i.e. male to female and female to male).
Medals and awards
Also, some medals are awarded entirely devoid of any further human interference. If you fulfill the given criteria (e.g. required number of days you remain with a flawless profile on the website, the minimum number of posts, comments, likes (i.e. upvotes) required, you are awarded the corresponding medal automatically by the system). You are free to choose the display of any or all these medals. There are two exceptions to this: the medal for site helper and site consultant require interaction with our staff and are hence awarded by human decision making and not on basis of an automised decision-making process.
Complaints
In the event of a someone complaining about your conduct or reporting your profile, our system is automatically notified and – depending on the nature or circumstance of the complaint – also is facilitated with the technical possibility to restrict any or all your interactivity until a later point of resolve or clearance. That also and especially includes the restriction of your possibilities to interact with other users, members or subscribers on the website and likewise limits your options to make use of our services. Upon receiving any complaint, however, the system also immediately and instantly reports this to our management and members of staff who are committed to taking action within a 24h time frame. Complaints, thus, constitute a semi-automised decision-making process, as there is human surveillance and intervention at the end of the action chain.
Your Use of the Registered Users Information.
You may not use another registered users information, whether private or not, for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats, in which case we reserve the absolute right to terminate account of any user who misuses or abuses the information of other users or who otherwise violate applicable law or any of our terms, agreements, policies or rules governing the use of website.
