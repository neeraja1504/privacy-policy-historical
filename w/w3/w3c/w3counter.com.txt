Effective Date: 4/22/2019
This Privacy Policy ("policy") applies to the websites: www.awio.com, www.improvely.com, www.w3counter.com, and www.websitegoodies.com (the "Websites", "Sites") owned and operated by Awio Web Services LLC (collectively "Awio", "we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how Awio collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide, as well as any personal information transferred to us for processing on behalf of our clients ("Client Data"). It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
By visiting one of our websites, visiting an Awio client's website that provides notice of its use of one of our products and/or this policy, or registering for our service, you acknowledge that you accept and consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Visitors to Awio's Websites
If you are a visitor to one of our Websites or an Awio client ("Client") who registers or signs in to one of our websites, we may collect the following information about you which may include information that can itself be used to identify and/or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"):
Contact information such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and time zone;
Billing information such as your credit card number and billing address;
Unique identifiers such as username, account number, order number, account name or password;
Information about your business such as company name, company address, company size or business type;
Contact information and unique identifiers for other members of your organization.
We also automatically collect certain information via technology:
As is true for most websites, when you visit our websites, some information is gathered automatically. This information may include the Operating System (OS) running on your device, Internet Protocol (IP) address, geo location based on your IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), access times, browser type and version, screen size, language, and the website you visited before our site. We also collect information about what files you viewed on our site (HTML pages, graphics, etc), what links you've clicked on and what page elements you've interacted with.
We automatically collect information using "cookies" or similar technologies in order to improve our website, our marketing activities and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular, to count visits to our site, to perform A/B tests, to identify repeat visits and for other purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our site and could remove cookies used for opt-out of tracking.
Awio may also collect certain information using Web Beacons (also referred to as Clear Gifs, Web Bugs, or Pixel Tags). "Web Beacons" are electronic images that may be used on Awio's Websites, in Awio's products or services, or in our email communications. They are used, for example, to count website visits or to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
We may create anonymous data records from personal information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.
Visitors to Awio's Clients' Websites
Our Clients may use customized and proprietary code, software and/or services ("Service(s)") to obtain information regarding the activities that users engage in while visiting their web pages ("Client Data"). When a user visits a website that uses Awio's Services, code contained on the website contacts Awio's servers and enables Awio to collect Client Data. Some Clients may also use their own code to obtain Client Data and then send such information to Awio's servers. Client Data may include Personally Identifiable Information, including, but not limited to, the types of information listed above.
Client Data is stored on Awio's web servers and databases (including those hosted on third party servers on behalf of Awio) for use in performing analysis, producing reports, and providing notifications or other services for the applicable Awio Client. In addition, Awio itself uses Awio's services in order to obtain insights into visitors' activities on its own Websites.
Awio's collection and analysis of Client Data helps our Clients to understand and improve their websites, to understand and improve their marketing campaigns, and to identify, investigate and deter fraudulent, illegal or unauthorized activity. Awio's Clients determine the types of Client Data that are sent to Awio's servers for analysis. This data may include or be linked to Personally Identifiable Information depending on how the Client uses Awio's Services on its website(s).
Awio's Clients are contractually prohibited from sending personally sensitive Client Data (e.g. personal health information, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs) to Awio and Awio does not knowingly receive such data.
In addition, Awio may collect certain information about a Client's visitor automatically, including: the Operating System (OS) running on their device, Internet Protocol (IP) address, geo location based on their IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), access times, browser type and version, screen size, language, and the website they visited before Client's website. We also collect information about what files viewed on Client's website (HTML pages, graphics, etc), what links they've clicked on and what page elements they've interacted with. Such information may be collected and shared with the Awio Client even though not specifically requested by the Client.
