Notice of Privacy Practices | SSM Health
Effective Date: June 30, 2018
Aviso de Prácticas de Privacidad en español
This Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) serves as a notice for all SSM Health entities providing health care services (such SSM Health entities referred to collectively as “we” or “our”). This Notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review this Notice carefully. If you have any questions about this Notice, please contact a registration representative at the hospital, physician’s clinic or other SSM Health Care entity where you are receiving health care services.
Who Will Follow This Notice
This Notice applies to our workforce members, including employees, volunteers, students and trainees. This Notice also applies to other health care and service providers that provide care or services at our facilities, or for our patients, in that, as a condition to providing services at our facilities, such providers must agree to comply with our policies, including our policies relating to patient privacy. This Notice, however, only details our privacy policies and does not govern the independent practices or operations of health care and service providers, such as the privacy practices that your doctor, if not employed by us, may use in his or her private office.
Our Pledge Regarding Medical Information
We understand that medical information about you and your health is personal. We are committed to protecting medical information about you. We create a record of the health care services you receive from us. We need this record to provide you with quality health care services and to comply with certain legal requirements. This Notice applies to all of the records of your care that we generate.
We are required by law to:
Make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private;
Give you this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you; and
Follow the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect.
How We May Use & Disclose Medical Information About You
The following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose medical information. For each category of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories:
For Treatment
We may use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, health care students, clergy, or others who are involved in your health care services. For example, your medical information may be shared with a physician to whom you have been referred in order to ensure that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you. We also may use your medical information to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. If you are in one of our facilities, we also may disclose medical information about you to people outside the facility who may be involved in your medical care after you leave our facility.
For Payment
We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services we provided to you, or that was provided to you by another facility, provider, or physician, may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company or a third party. For example, we may need to give your health plan information about your treatment so they can pay us or reimburse you. We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.
For Health care Operations
We may use and disclose medical information about you to improve our services or support our business activities. For example, we may use medical information to review our treatment and services, to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, health care students, and other personnel for review and learning purposes. We or our designee may send you a patient satisfaction survey via mail or to an email address that you provided to us. Specific individual information will not be included in the email without authentication of a specific patient identifier to access the survey.
Notice
SSM Health, Dean Health Systems and Dean Health Plan are part of an Organized Health Care Arrangement (OHCA). As part of the OHCA, we may from time to time share your information with other members of the OHCA in order to perform joint health care operations. For example, we may share your information in order to: improve population health management; conduct quality assessment and improvement activities; conduct or arrange for medical review, legal services, audit services, and fraud and abuse detection programs; business planning and development such as cost management; and business management and general OHCA administrative activities.
Appointment Reminders
We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment with us or to notify you that it’s time for you to schedule a medical service with us.
Treatment Alternatives
We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.
Health-Related Benefits & Services
We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health related benefits, services, or health education resources, such as screenings, seminars, classes, or other programs that may be of interest and beneficial to you.
Patient Assistance Programs
We may use and disclose your information to third parties for the purpose of determining whether you qualify for a private or government patient assistance program that would reduce the amount you owe to SSM.
Fundraising Activities
We may use information about you to contact you in an effort to raise money for our operations. For this purpose, we may use your name, address and phone number, the dates you received treatment or services and the department in which you received those services. If you do not want to be contacted for fundraising efforts, you will be given the opportunity to notify the appropriate Privacy Officer in writing.
Hospital Directory
If you are receiving health care services in one of our hospitals, unless you advise the registration representative otherwise, we may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory while you are a patient at the hospital. This information may include your name, location in the hospital, your general condition (e.g., good, fair, etc.) and your religious affiliation. The directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may be released to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be given to a member of the clergy, such as a priest or rabbi, even if they don't ask for you by name. This is so your family, friends and clergy can visit you in the hospital and generally know how you are doing. In addition, we may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status and location.
Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care
Unless you object, we may share information about you to a care giver who may be a friend or family member. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. If you are unable to object to such a disclosure, we may discuss your medical information with a family member, friend, or other person if, using professional judgment, we conclude that you do not object. Only the information that is relevant to your care or payment for your care will be disclosed.
Research
Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who received one medication to those who received another, for the same condition. All research projects, however, are subject to a special internal approval process.
As Required By Law
We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law.
Special Situations
Organ & Tissue Donation
If you are an organ donor, we may release medical information to organizations that handle organ procurement or organ, eye or tissue transplantation or to an organ donation bank, as necessary to facilitate organ or tissue donation and transplantation.
Military
If you are a member of the armed forces, we may release medical information about you as required by military command authorities. We may also release medical information about foreign military personnel to the appropriate foreign military authority.
Worker’s Compensation
Under Federal or State law, we may be required to provide copies of your medical information in connection with a workers’ compensation claim to your employer, to you or your dependents, to certain state agencies or to others involved in your claim for compensation.
Public Health Risks (Health & Safety to You and/or Others)
We may disclose medical information about you for public health activities. We may use and disclose medical information about you to agencies when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person or when we are legally required to do so.

Health Oversight Activities
We may disclose medical information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include, for example, audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.
Lawsuits & Disputes

We may also disclose medical information about you in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute.

To identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person;
About the victim of a crime if, under certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain the person's agreement;

National Security & Intelligence Activities
We may release medical information about you to authorized federal officials for intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other national security activities authorized by law.

This release would be necessary (1) for the institution to provide you with health care; (2) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of others; or (3) for the safety and security of the correctional institution.
Other Uses of Medical Information
Most uses and disclosures of psychotherapy notes, uses and disclosures of medical information for marketing purposes and certain disclosures that constitute a sale of your medical information will require your written permission.

If you revoke your permission, we will no longer use or disclose medical information about you for the reasons covered by your written authorization. You understand that we are unable to take back any disclosures we have already made with your permission, and that we are required to retain our records of the care that we provided to you.
