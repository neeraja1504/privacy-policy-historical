Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting the Selective Service System website. This service and its website is owned and operated by the Selective Service System and is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide us with the information. Here is how we handle the information you provide during your visit to this website.
In addition to SSS’s official website on www.sss.gov, SSS uses social media and third-party (non-SSS) websites to share information and to engage with the general public.  Under those conditions, there may be third-party applications and/or services linked to or embedded on www.sss.gov to enhance functionality or facilitate website data analytics. Similarly, applications created by SSS may be embedded on third-party websites as a way to increase public awareness of Agency activities. The integration of these features is intended to provide a seamless user experience and enhance the publics ability to access information and interface with SSS.  Some third-party websites and applications may make personally identifiable information (PII) available to the public and/or SSS based on user controlled settings or the privacy policies of the third-party. SSS will not collect, (maintain, use, or share), PII that becomes available through SSS’s use of third-party websites or applications.
Please be aware that the privacy policy provided on social media and third-party websites that are not a part of the sss.gov domain may not be the same as the privacy policy described here. PII or other information you voluntarily share through social media, or a third-party website or application, may be accessible by non-government third parties. As described in these website policies, you can communicate directly with SSS without involving a third-party.  SSS will conduct and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for each use of a third-party website. Each use of a third-party website may have unique functionality or practices.

What are Your Rights Under the Privacy Act of 1974?
The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in "systems of records (SOR)." SOR is information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier. The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.
The Act's major provisions require agencies to:
Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character, and uses of a new or revised SOR;
Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
Allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR.
An overview of the Privacy Act can be viewed at the following web site: http://www.justice.gov/opcl/overview-privacy-act-1974-2012-edition
The Selective Service Privacy Act statement can be viewed on the website below: Privacy Act Statement

Information Protection
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this federal government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.

All uses of that information are described on the webpage containing the form.
