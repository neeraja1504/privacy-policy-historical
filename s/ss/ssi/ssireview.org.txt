Privacy Policy
At Stanford Social Innovation Review , we want you to enjoy and benefit from our websites and online services secure in the knowledge that we have implemented fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. Our privacy policy below describes the information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding collection and use of your personal information.
Please read this privacy policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the website will constitute your agreement to this privacy policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the website. This privacy policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on sites linked to from the website.
In addition to reviewing this privacy policy, please read our Terms of Use. Your use of the website constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well.
This privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the website by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the privacy policy.
What Information the Website Collects
Our site may automatically recognize your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system, and the website you passed through to reach us. In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information, like the numbers and frequency of visits to the site and its areas—very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program.
Some features of our site offer you the option of providing information such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, organization, location, or any other identifying information. As described in greater detail below, such information will only be used to provide you with products or services you have requested, or additional information about the sites or its affiliates. (You may also provide us with such information in the course of subscribing to Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine or other offerings from Stanford Social Innovation Review —details of how we use such information are also provided below.)
How the Website Uses Information You Provide
The information the website collects is used to improve the content of Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine and its site, and to keep you apprised of important developments. For example, we may use personally identifiable information to contact you as part of an online survey about our editorial offerings, inform you of material changes or additions to our services, advise you of account status, or contact you in order to comply with any legal requirements. Also, we compile and use your information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers, as well as additional products that may be of interest to you.
In some cases, we may share personally identifiable information to contact you (sometimes through a vendor or business partner) for the reasons we have described.
We will not sell any personally identifying information obtained through the site. We do not collect personally identifying information from our visitors, other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis. From time to time we allow reputable companies, whose products or services we feel may interest our enewsletter subscribers, to contact these subscribers using the addresses provided to us during the process of subscribing to Stanford Social Innovation Review ’s print edition.
We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate—not information about you personally—to our partners about how visitors use the sites. From time to time, we conduct research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information you provide to us upon registration, on order forms, as well as from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis, and we may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses.
In some cases, we may disclose information about you to a third party if we are required to do so by law or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process, to protect and defend our rights or to prevent misuse of our sites, or to protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.
In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, Stanford Social Innovation Review reserves the right to transfer your personally identifiable information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets.
