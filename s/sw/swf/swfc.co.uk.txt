SWFC Privacy Policy - Sheffield Wednesday
Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
As one of our customers or someone else with whom we do business, you understand and agree that we collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”).
We use your personal information in order to fulfil our commitment to providing sport products to you and with added services to improve our products and services which you experience in connection with all of your interactions with Sheffield Wednesday (the “Purpose”). As part of that undertaking, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the personal information that we gather.
2.    APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY
This Policy applies to personal information regarding fans and other individuals with whom we do business or who buy tickets, products, or services from us and to the use of that personal information in any form – whether oral, electronic or written.
This Policy gives our commitment to protect your personal information and has been adopted by all of the separate and distinct legal entities that manage, operate, franchise, license, own and/or provide services to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited. Those entities include the separate and distinct legal entities which provide services to you under the Sheffield Wednesday brand. References to “Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited.”, “we” and “our” throughout this Policy, depending upon the context, collectively refer to those separate and distinct legal entities.
While this Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our personal information processing activities globally, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws. For example, the laws of a particular country may limit the types of personal information we can collect or the manner in which we process that personal information. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and/or practices to reflect the requirements of local law.
3.    DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your data.
Data Processor (or Service Providers)
Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any person (other than an employee of the Data Controller) who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.
We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.

4.    TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
The term “personal information” in this Policy refers to information that does or is capable of identifying you as an individual. The types of personal information that we process (which may vary by jurisdiction based on applicable law) include:
•    your name, gender, personal and work contact details, date and place of birth, image/photos, nationality;
•    your credit card details, and your account details such as customer reference number or customer ID and credentials;
•    information, feedback or content you provide regarding your marketing preferences, in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or promotional offers, or to our websites or apps and those of third parties; or;
•    information collected whilst you access a PML app or website (we describe this in more detail in Sections 8 and 9 below).
Much of the personal information we process is information that you or someone acting on your behalf knowingly provides to us. However, in other instances, we process personal information that we are able to infer about you based on other information you provide to us or during our interactions with you, or personal information about you that we receive from a third party. This Policy also applies to the personal information about you that we receive from a third party, unless specifically covered by such third party’s privacy policy.
There may be instances in which the personal information that you provide to us or that we collect is considered Sensitive Personal Information under the privacy laws of some countries. Those laws define “Sensitive Personal Information” to mean personal information from which we can determine or infer an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, membership in a trade union or professional association, physical or mental health or condition, medical treatment, genetic data, sexual life or judicial data (including information concerning the commission or alleged commission of a criminal offence). In some very rare instances, financial records may form part of Sensitive Personal Information where you are located. We only process Sensitive Personal Information in your jurisdiction if and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.
When you agree to this Policy you are, to the extent required under your local law, granting your express and written consent to the processing of any personal information that you provide to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited that is considered to be Sensitive Personal Information or financial information. Save to the extent required by law, you are not obliged to provide Sheffield Wednesday with any of your Sensitive Personal Information, and should you chose not to, this will not prevent you from purchasing any products or services from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited.
5.    HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Subject to applicable laws, we may collect, use and disclose relevant portions of your personal information in order to:
•    provide and charge for products and related services;
•    provide you with a better or more personalised level of product, service, and/or experience including information and services from a third party (such as other products, or offers related to your preference for a given product);
•    respond to requests for information and services, including services from a third party (such as companies who make and transport products, provide services, and research product buyers);
•    administer the Sheffield Wednesday newsletter and updates product;
•    fulfil contractual obligations to you, anyone involved in the process of making your access to products the best possible;
•    conduct market research, customer satisfaction and quality assurance surveys, and direct marketing and sales promotions;
•    provide for the safety and security of staff, or other buyers;
•    administer general record keeping;
•    meet legal and regulatory requirements; or;
•    test and evaluate new products and services;
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited. uses and retains your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the Purpose.  There is a retention schedule in place and you can request to see this.
6.    DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
From time to time, we may disclose your personal information. We would always make that disclosure in agreement with applicable law. In some jurisdictions, data privacy laws may require us to obtain your consent before we transfer your information from your originating country to other countries. When you agree to this Policy, you are, to the extent required and permitted under your local law, granting your consent to the transfer of your personal information to such other countries for the Purpose and to the extent stated in this section and as described in Section 4 above.
Circumstances where we might make such disclosure (in addition to those described in Section 5 above) include:
Our Agents, Service Providers and Suppliers
Like most clubs, we may outsource the processing of certain functions and/or information to third parties. We may also engage market research firms to assist us in contacting fans for the purpose of market research and quality assurance. When we do outsource the processing of your personal information to third parties or provide your personal information to third-party service providers, we oblige those third parties to protect your personal information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Policy, with appropriate security measures.
Consumer Insights
Where we hold personal information about you, we may disclose this personal information to other companies that also hold information about you. These companies may combine the information in order to better understand your preferences and interests, thereby enabling them and us to serve you better. If your personal information is used for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to that by contacting us using the contact information provided under Section 12 below.
Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell Sheffield Wednesday assets, or cease being the manager or franchisor of product that is currently part of our portfolio. In those circumstances, we may include the personal information collected about you, or control of that personal information, as a business asset in any such transfer. Also, in the unlikely event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, personal information collected about you, or control of such information, may be one of the transferred assets.
Legal Requirements
We reserve the right to disclose any personal information we have concerning you if we are compelled to do so by a court of law or lawfully requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we determine it is necessary or desirable to comply with the law or to protect or defend our rights or property in accordance with applicable laws. We also reserve the right to retain personal information collected and to process such personal information to comply with accounting and tax rules and regulations and any specific record retention laws.
7.    CENTRALISED DATA PROCESSING ACTIVITIES
Like most international businesses, we have centralised certain aspects of our data processing activities in accordance with applicable laws, which, in many instances, will result in the transfer of your personal information from one country to another. For example, if you purchase a product while located outside of the UK, the personal information gathered in that process might be transferred to and processed to a company outside of the UK so as to deliver the product to you, in accordance with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited’s binding corporate rules (where they apply to you). The jurisdictions where that information will be processed may or may not have laws that seek to preserve the privacy of personal information. Nevertheless, whenever your personal information is transferred within Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited and subcontracted companies, your personal information will be processed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Policy and applicable laws.

Further, when you use our apps, we may collect certain information automatically, including technical information related to your mobile device, your device’s unique identifier, your mobile network information, the type of mobile browser you use and information about the way you use the app.
Depending on the particular app you use and only after you have agreed to such collection, we may also collect information stored on your device, including contact information, friends lists, login information (where necessary to allow us to communicate with other apps at your request), photos, videos, location information or other digital content. Further details of the kinds of information we collect is set out in the privacy notice for each individual app.
10.    CHOICE
You may always choose what personal information (if any) you wish to provide to us. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected (for example, we cannot deliver a product without an address).
If you provide us with your contact details (e.g. postal address, email address, telephone number or fax number), we may contact you to let you know about the products, services, promotions and events offered that we think you may be interested in. We may also share your personal information with carefully-selected third parties, who may communicate directly with you. In some jurisdictions, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we do so. You can always choose whether or not to receive any or all of these communications by contacting us as described in Section 12 below or following the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in the communications.
If you have an account with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited, we ask you to indicate your communication preferences at the time you apply for membership or when you create your user profile. We may also ask you to indicate how you would like to receive any offers, marketing and promotional information (e.g. via email or regular mail) and whether you would be willing to participate in surveys. Once you have indicated your preferences, you can always change them.
In some jurisdictions, in addition to you agreeing to this Policy, data privacy laws may require us to obtain a separate consent before we send you information that you have not specifically requested. In certain circumstances, your consent may be implied (e.g. where communications are required in order to fulfil your requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may seek your consent expressly in accordance with applicable laws (e.g. where the information collected is regarded to be Sensitive Personal Information under local regulations).
We will abide by any request from you not to send you direct marketing materials. When such a request is received, your contact details will be “suppressed” rather than deleted. This will ensure that your request is recorded and retained unless you provide a later consent that overrides it.
11.    UPDATING OR ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
With some limited exceptions, you have rights to access and update personal information held about you. If you want to inquire about any personal information we may have about you, you can do so by sending us a written request by letter or email to the addresses set out in Section
12 below. Please be sure to include your full name, address, and/or email address and phone number so we can ascertain your identity and whether we have any personal information regarding you, or in case we need to contact you to obtain any additional information we may require to make that determination.
You may request that we correct, cancel, and/or stop processing or using personal information that we hold about you. If we agree that the personal information is incorrect, or that the processing should be stopped, we will delete or correct the personal information.
