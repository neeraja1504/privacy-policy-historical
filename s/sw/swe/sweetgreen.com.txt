If you believe that we might have any personal information collected online from a child under 13, please contact us at **privacy@sweetgreen.com ** .
Your California Privacy Rights. If you are a user of the Services and a California resident, California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code § 1798.83) permits you to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information regarding our disclosure of your personal information (if any) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this law applies to you and you would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to privacy@sweetgreen.com.
A Note to Users Outside of the United States . If you are a non-U.S. user of the Services, by using our Services and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer and processing.
1. Types of Data We Collect .
(a) Personal Information You Provide to Us.
We will collect personal information you submit when you create an account on our Services, including your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and password (“ Account ”).
When you place an order through the Services for delivery or to pick up in one of our restaurants, we collect information necessary to process your order.
We retain information about your transactions with us, such as the details of past orders placed through your Account.
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail.
We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that indicate that personal information is being collected.
(b) Information Collected via Technology.
Information Collected by Our Servers . Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information automatically from your computer or device, including but not limited to:
The date and time of your visit, the pages and content you view, and links you click on while navigating within our Services;
Information about the type of content accessed via our Services;
The site you visited before and after visiting our Site;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with your browser online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
Search terms you enter using our Services or on a referral site;
Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers;
Information about your device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device; and
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).
Cookies . Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “ Cookies ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
Pixel Tags . In addition, we use “ Pixel Tags ” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages and e-mail messages. We may use Pixel Tags to collect information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails.
Analytics . We use third-party analytics services including Google Analytics (“ Analytics Services ”), to help analyze how users use our Site. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site (the “ Analytics Information ”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at privacy@sweetgreen.com. To learn more about how Google uses data, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Location Information . If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with location-based information and advertising.
(c) Information Collected from Third Party Companies. We may receive personal information and/or anonymous data about you from companies that help provide our Services, including LevelUp, the provider of our mobile Application. We may also receive personal information and/or anonymous data from other third parties, including but not limited to companies that have entered into joint marketing relationships or other joint ventures with us. We may combine any information about you that we receive from third parties with information we have already collected from you via our Services and use that combined information pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
(d) Information Collected from Social Networking Sites. If you communicate with us or mention us via Social Network Sites (“ SNSs ”) (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may collect the communications, your name, your user ID and/or user name associated with that SNS, any information or content you have permitted the SNS to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address and any information you have made public in connection with that SNS. You should check your privacy settings on your SNSs to understand and change the information sent to us through these services.
(e) Referral Information Collected from You. If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party’s name and e-mail address in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. You or the third party may contact us at privacy@sweetgreen.com to request the removal of this information from our database. As part of your use of the Services, we may provide you the opportunity to connect automatically with your friends through the use of contact importer tools. If you elect to use these tools, we will access information regarding your friends to facilitate automatic connection with your friends.
