Privacy Policy for Sweetclipart.com
Specifics added for the GDPR law: [Updated May 2018] I use Google Analytics and Google Adsense on sweetclipart.com and m.sweetclipart.com, and a very limited version of Statcounter. My Google Analytics stats are retained for 14 months then are overwritten. My Statcounter stats are usually retained for about 1-2 days then are overwritten. Anonymous stats are also logged by my hosting account, Hostgator; I keep those logs for up to 1 year. I only use these stats for personal use, such as to analyze keyword trends, traffic, and backlinks, and to prevent abuse of my website (for example, to block bot IP addresses). These stats are mostly anonymous.  _ _I do not collect information that personally identifies any of my visitors, and I do not share my statistics logs with anyone.
If you require any more information or have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact me at sweetclipart.com/contact.
At sweetclipart.com, the privacy of my visitors is of extreme importance. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by sweetclipart.com and how it is used.
