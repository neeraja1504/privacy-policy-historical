About — Sweeties Freebies
Sweeties Freebies is part of Sweeties Brand, Inc. Wendy Limauge, aka Sweetie, created Sweeties Freebies for the hottest freebies, coupons, and shopping deals to help readers save money.
Our views on Extreme Couponing: We don’t really agree with the whole concept but rather focus more on saving the “casual couponer” money each week through store sales and coupon matchups. There is not need for a huge stockpile to keep extra food in your house. Most of us don’t have 30 or more hours to spend getting all of the groceries we buy for free but we can all spend a little time each week to save money on our grocery bill.

“Why buy it when you can get it for free”? We have heard that many times and in this economy we all looking for a little something extra. Companies want to give you a free sample, free trial, and sometimes full size product so you will try what they have to offer and hopefully buy it or at least tell your friends (word of mouth marketing). When we say free we mean free. If we post free samples, free trials, or anything else that is free you can be sure it will be 100% free for you, no strings attached.
Sometimes we find great offers that do require a purchase or they are free when you pay for shipping. We like to pass these along to our readers as well. These offers will always indicate if a purchase if required so you will know they are not 100% free.
We don’t actually send you the freebies and samples you see listed on our site. We scour the web to find free stuff for you and put them all in one place on Sweeties Freebies so you don’t have to do the work of finding them.
We post freebies for the United States and Canada.
