Cookies
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive by web page servers. When you visit the website or mobile application, Southwest Gas Corporation may utilize "session" cookies, which allow us to verify when you travel from page to page within our online service applications.
Additionally, Southwest Gas uses retargeting tools to better understand customer preferences and to determine the effectiveness of our outreach campaigns. Retargeting is a cookie-based technology that uses Javascript code to “follow” visitors when they leave our website. We use retargeting to operate energy education, public safety and informational campaigns in partnership with third-party vendors. As part of our campaigns, we place pixel tags on individual web pages within our Site to track interest in certain types of web content. These tags are used to obtain information about the computer being used to view Web pages, including the IP address, the user’s operating system, and browser type. Pixel tags provide Southwest Gas and our vendors with information about topics and activities of interest to Site visitors, and the digital advertisements or articles that referred visitors to our Site. Retargeting enables our third-party advertising partners to show you ads about our programs and activities, based on your interests, on other websites.
Data on website and mobile application usage that we collect using cookies or retargeting is not tied to your personally identifiable information and is only used in aggregate form.

California Do Not Track Disclosure
Under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. Like many websites, our Site is not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users' online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator's service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual customer’s online activities over time and across different online services when using our Online Services.
