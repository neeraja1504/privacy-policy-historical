SwapitShop: Swap games, DVDs, cards, vouchers, fashion and more at the No.1 swapshop
When you register on Internet sites you are generally required to provide certain information. Different sites ask for different information and do different things with that information. We want to be very clear about the information we collect and what we do with it.
1.    What information do we collect?
Registration: When you register with us, we collect your name, address, telephone number, email address, nickname, password, gender and age.
Your use of our service: We will keep a record of which products and services you are interested in and which products and services you swap. We also monitor user traffic patterns and site use.
2.    What do you do with the information?
We will use the information provided by you to promote a more personal service. We are required by the Data Protection Act 1984 and 1998 to follow strict procedures to protect customer information.
We use your personal information collected to help us to:
identify the validity of users;
email users to confirm that they have registered with us;
allow questions about swaps and acceptance and rejection of offers to be forwarded;
allow us to contact users when required; and
allow us to mail users with information about our service and the services and products of carefully selected companies.
When a member makes an offer on a swap, accepts or rejects a swap or asks or replies to questions, no personal or contact details are disclosed.
When a swap is agreed we will then ask the parties concerned to provide the contact details they wish to give to the other person. These are the only details sent to the other person.
In order for us to provide the best service possible and to make the website easier for users we also collect information on: browser type (e.g. Navigator, Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows), IP address and Internet domain (e.g. Demon, AOL).
We use technology to save your password for each session so you don't have to re-enter it each time you login to our service. Members can disable this facility when registering or by editing their "my profile page".
3.    Will we pass your information on?
If you ticked the Swapits and special offers box on the registration form, then we may pass the information we collect about you to other carefully selected companies whose products and services we think may be of interest to you. Please remember you may deregister from this service at any time from your SwapitShop account or by contacting info@swapitshop.com
4.    What about "cookies"?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. These allow us to store your personal information and provide features to make your use of our service easier. Most browsers allow the cookie function to be turned off. If you want to know how to do this, look at the help menu on your browser.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact us on info@swapitshop.com. -
