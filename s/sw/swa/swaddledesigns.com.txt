Cookies and Other Like Technologies
Our website uses "cookie" and other similar web technology like web beacons. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to SwaddleDesigns. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf.
A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session. A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie. When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This SwaddleDesigns-placed cookie may contain information that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is only saved in this SwaddleDesigns-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.
If you register with us, this SwaddleDesigns-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.
Third-Party Advertising Partners
SwaddleDesigns uses third-party service providers to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet.
These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags which are industry-standard technology used by most major websites.
In addition to the information about your visits to our website, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from SwaddleDesigns. Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partner: AdRoll. In the future we may partner with other companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off SwaddleDesigns.com. If this occurs, SwaddleDesigns provides you with an opportunity to opt out when these advertisements are served. You may manage your third-party advertising preferences by clicking to opt out.
Facebook Custom Audience Ads from SwaddleDesigns
We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us. We do not share any of your personal information, including your shopping history, with Facebook. The tool lets SwaddleDesigns convert your e-mail address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from e-mail addresses of its users. You may opt-out of Facebook Custom Audience ads from SwaddleDesigns.
Social Media Interactions
SwaddleDesigns invites you to socialize and share your favorite designs and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at SwaddleDesigns.com. SwaddleDesigns does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a Facebook "Like" through SwaddleDesigns, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from SwaddleDesigns websites. You can also delete comments made while at SwaddleDesigns.com from your Facebook Page.

We may allow you to sign in to your SwaddleDesigns.com account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from SwaddleDesigns. SwaddleDesigns will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information.
