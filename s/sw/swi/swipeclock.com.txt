Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Company is conscientious and considers the security of Personally Identifiable Information to be an important matter, to the point it sends its entire technical department to security conferences regularly and devotes considerable talent and resources to the topic of security. Now, you realize that every month in the news, some big company makes the headlines for just having been hacked, right? Nobody is immune, security holes are found in every major computer operating system every day, and that’s not going to change any time soon. So, let’s be clear: part of being street smart in cyberspace means not putting sensitive data in places where there’s no good reason for it to be. The most reliable defense there is against the world’s most sophisticated hackers is not having anything they want so they will spend their time elsewhere. Reseller acknowledges that despite commercially reasonable efforts, absolute security from any Internet-connected system is impossible. Secure information cannot be guaranteed to be completely free from all possible risks and threats.
