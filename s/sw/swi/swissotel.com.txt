Accor Hotels : GLOBAL HOTEL GUEST PRIVACY POLICY
1. THE ACCORHOTELS GROUP'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING PRIVACY
We consider you an important customer. Our first priority is to offer you exceptional stays and experiences throughout the world.
Your complete satisfaction and confidence in AccorHotels is absolutely essential to us.
That's why, as part of our commitment to meeting your expectations, we have set up (and we had a privacy policy before the much anticipated GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation ;-)) a customer personal data protection charter. This charter formalizes our commitments to you and describes how the AccorHotels Group uses your personal data.

2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION
In this charter, “AccorHotels Group” means:
Accor SA, the AccorHotels Group parent company, with registered offices at 82 rue Henri Farman, 92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux, France;
Subsidiary or “family” companies of Accor SA involved in the hotel businesses of the AccorHotels Group; and
hotels operated under one of the AccorHotels Group brands throughout the world (Raffles, Sofitel Legend, Fairmont, SO/, Sofitel, onefinestay, Rixos, MGallery, Pullman, Swissôtel, 25hours Hotels, Novotel, Mercure, Mama Shelter, Adagio, JO&JOE, ibis, ibis Styles, ibis budget, Grand Mercure, The Sebel and hotelF1). This list of brands is regularly updated and can be viewed on accorhotels.com.
Good to know!
You probably don't know this, but the hotel you are booked to stay in is probably not owned by Accor SA or one of its family of companies. Most AccorHotels branded hotels are operated under a franchise or management agreement between the hotel’s owner and Accor SA (or one of its subsidiaries across the world).
This is why, when staying in one of these hotels, your personal data will be dealt with by Accor SA and the hotel, both acting as Data Controllers for their own, separate, purposes. In summary:
Accor SA will process your data because it manages a central booking engine, which allows Accor SA to collect the data necessary to organise your stay in hotels under an AccorHotels brand and to communicate this data to the concerned hotels. Accor SA also manages a global database of clients who stay in hotels under an AccorHotels brand. With the help of its subsidiary PRO-FID SAS, Accor SA also manages the Le Club AccorHotels loyalty programme;
Each hotel will process your data to manage its contractual relationship with you (invoicing, payment, booking management etc.), to perform marketing activities and to comply with its legal obligations.
Accor SA has communicated the principles set out in this charter to all of the AccorHotels branded hotels and their respective owners. We will do our upmost to ensure that all hotels comply with the applicable data protection laws and this charter in relation to the processing of your personal data.

3. AccorHotels' TEN PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
In accordance with applicable regulations, in particular the European General Data Protection Regulation, we have instituted the following ten principles throughout the AccorHotels Group:
Lawfulness: We use personal data only if:
we obtain the consent of the person, OR
it is necessary to do so for the performance of a contract to which the person is a party, OR
it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, OR
it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the person, OR
we have a legitimate interest in using personal data and our usage does not adversely affect the persons’ rights
Fairness: We can explain why we need the personal data we collect.
Purpose limitation and data minimisation: We only use personal data that we really need. If the result can be achieved with less personal data, then we make sure we use the minimum data required.
Transparency: We inform people about the way we use their personal data
We facilitate the exercise of the people’s rights : access to their personal data, rectification and erasure of their personal data and the right to object to the use of their personal data
Storage limitation: We retain personal data for a limited period
We ensure the security of personal data, i.e. its integrity and confidentiality.
If a third party uses personal data, we make sure it has the capacity to protect that personal data.
If personal data is transferred outside Europe, we ensure this transfer is covered by specific legal tools.
If personal data is compromised (lost, stolen, damaged, unavailable…), we notify such breaches to the respective country’s responsible authority and to the person concerned, if the breach is likely to cause a high-risk in respect of the rights and freedoms of this person.
For any questions concerning the ten principles of AccorHotels data protection policies, please contact the Data Privacy department whose details appear in the clause "Your rights".
