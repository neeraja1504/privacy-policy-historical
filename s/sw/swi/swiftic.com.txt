However, those third parties may share the information that they collect from you, with Como and with Como’s service providers (e.g. payment collection and processing providers, and e-commerce platforms), and Como may use such information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Use of Cookies and Server Logs
Cookies (which may be HTML files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views or promotion views. The Website may use “cookies”, “web beacons” and other similar information-gathering technologies (collectively, “Information Gathering Technologies”) to collect non-PII automatically as you access and browse the Website. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Como only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.
Como uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Como uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. We set a persistent cookie for such uses as to store your app name and/or user name so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the users’ experience on the Website. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website, but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited.
By visiting the Website, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to gather information about your use of the Website through these Information Gathering Technologies.
Server logs capture certain non–PII, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user’s ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally but not exclusively used to help plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is compatible with our visitors’ web browsing systems.
Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information
You may send us a request to access the Personally Identifiable Information that we may collect through your use of the Website or the Como Platform. We may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity.
Data Retention
We may delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our systems or anonymize it if we deem it no longer necessary for our reasonable business needs.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us, and we implement security measures regarding your Personally Identifiable Information, to the extent collected, to reduce the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use means to protect and secure your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Website and the Como Platform and its databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can contact us at privacy@como.com.
