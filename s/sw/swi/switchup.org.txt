This includes data such as the search terms you enter, the pages you visit (inbound and outbound clicks), and the items you purchase. We may also collect information about your device such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, device identifiers, and data about the network, operating system, or software you use to connect to the Site. We also automatically collect information from your browser when you visit the Site, including your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring website address.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the features offered on our Site. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, pixels, and other similar technologies, to track your use on the Site; if you are accessing our Site from a European Economic Area or Switzerland (collectively “EU”) based IP address, we will only do so with your consent. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the Services we offer our Site visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.
We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. If you click on such an advertisement, these companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, beacons, and pixels, to collect information about users who interact with these advertisements and connect to advertiser websites. This Privacy Notice does not apply to information that may be collected by those third parties if you click on a third party advertisement. Our Site does not provide any personal information to these third parties.
When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide personal information that is necessary to provide Services, you may not be able to use some features or Services.

We may combine the information we collect with information from third-party sources for these purposes.
4. Do we share information we collect and why?

With your consent, we may also republish user reviews on third-party sites such as Quora, Medium, and Facebook.
We may share information with companies working on our behalf, such as sponsorship partners so they may analyze how users utilize our Services for us.

Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information.
If you are a user, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer/phone, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in credentials and password private.
