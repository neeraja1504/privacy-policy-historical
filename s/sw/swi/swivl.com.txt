For each visitor to our websites, we collect non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, preferences, technical session information, browser type ("non-personal information”).

We also use information collected from cookies and other anonymous identifiers to improve your user experience and the quality of our services. If you give us personal information, we may remove the identifiers and aggregate it, in which case it also becomes non-personal information.

For instance, we may use non-personal information to manage the site, track site usage, provide context for referring traffic sources, and improve overall site performance. We may share non-personal information to third-parties for any reason, including with our partners, advertisers or sponsors.
