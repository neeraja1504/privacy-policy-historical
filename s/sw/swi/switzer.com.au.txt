Personal information
When we refer to personal information we mean information that we directly collect from you, from which your identity is apparent. This information may include information or an opinion about you, from which your identity can reasonably be ascertained.
Why we collect your personal information
We collect and receive personal information from our customers, affiliates and partners or from other organisations in order to conduct our business. From time to time we may offer other products and services.
To enable us to maintain a successful business relationship with you, we may disclose your personal information with other organisations that provide products or services used or marketed by us.
The types of organisations to which we are likely to disclose information about you include credit card processors, banks and financial institutions, freight companies and couriers, market research and advertising agencies, business advisors, accountants and lawyers. We may also disclose your personal information to any other organisation that may have or is considering having an interest in our business.
We may use your personal information for statistical and marketing analysis purposes; and research and development purposes.
How do we collect your personal information?
We collect your personal information during your sign up process to our service, through our free online newsletter or through our parent company the Switzer group.
We collect personal information in a number of ways, including directly from you when you enter your personal details to subscribe to our free online newsletter, when you purchase our products and services, when you provide information by phone; and/or in documents such as an order form, from third parties such as our affiliate partners, from publicly available sources of information, or from our own records.
To whom will we disclose your personal information?
Where possible, we will inform you, at or before the time of collecting your personal information, the types of organisations that we intend to disclose your personal information to.
Switzer will use personal information provided to it only for the purpose for which it was provided. Personal information will not be used for any other purpose without the consent of its provider unless Switzer is required by law to disclose that information. Switzer may be required to disclose personal information to third parties in order to provide a service requested. For example, when a user agrees to be contacted by a content partner of Switzer, disclosure will be necessary to fulfil the purpose for which the personal information was provided. Other than in circumstances such as these, Switzer will not disclose personal information provided, such as name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organisation or person outside Switzer unless the provider has authorised Switzer to do so.
Sometimes we are required or authorised by law to disclose your personal information. Circumstances in which we may disclose your personal information would be to a Court or Tribunal in response to a request or in response to a subpoena or to the Australian Taxation Office.
We may collect details from or disclose your personal information to credit or fraud agencies or debt recovery agencies for verification or debt collection purposes.
