We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Website or product. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you or match this non-Personal Information with your other Personal Information unless or except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made. Where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information. For clarity, when we refer to usage of Website or Nuance Product Usage Data in this section, we do not mean the contents of your voice data or text and related data derived from the contents of your communications using Nuance Products. For information about specific Nuance Products, please see specific privacy notices directed to such products.

Certain Nuance Products require you to enter Speech Data in order to use and derive the benefits of the particular product. These Nuance Products collect and process the Speech Data you input into the Nuance Products. Nuance or third parties acting under the direction of Nuance, pursuant to confidentiality agreements, use the Speech Data to develop, tune, enhance, and improve Nuance services and products.

E-Commerce.
You may be asked to share Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address when you make purchases, seek customer or technical support or otherwise interact with Nuance. When you shop online or buy direct from Nuance, these purchase transactions may be conducted through Nuance vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by Nuance on behalf of Nuance may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. Nuance (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law. You may also make purchases of Nuance Products; seek customer or technical support through Nuance's distributors or service providers. In these circumstances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the distributor or service provider or a third-party partner on their website, which will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information.

Nuance may allow customers to register products online or through similar ways. Personal Information or data provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or Application (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new Nuance products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you register, we may ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased, or other product-identifying information.
Failure to register any Nuance product will not diminish the rights you have under the applicable product warranty.
Online Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes.
You may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, or other Personal Information, for entry into a particular promotion, including sweepstakes and contests, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion, contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. Certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes may be run by a Nuance service provider or vendor or co-branded with one of our partners. In these instances the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or a third-party partner on their website. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Policy.
