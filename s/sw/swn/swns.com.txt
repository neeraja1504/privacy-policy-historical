South West News Service Limited (trading as SWNS) is a limited company registered in England and Wales (company no 6561578) and registered as a controller with the ICO under number Z1433952.
3. The personal data we collect about you
Personal data means any data that identifies or can be used to identify a person. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
The types of personal data that we may collect from or about you will depend on which group you fall into and may include:
Individuals working for our customers and suppliers and agents
your name(s) and contact details
your job title or role and the department/division/publication you work for

any correspondence we have with you in relation to the content submitted by you
biographical and other information about you and your image, where any content submitted by you relates to or includes you
Visitors to our website
your name(s) and contact details when you contact our news desk, picture desk or any of our offices
any correspondence we have with you
4. How we use your personal data
We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We will generally rely on one of three legal grounds for using your personal data:
where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you
where necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, provided those interests do not override your fundamental rights and interests
where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation
Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal ground for using your personal data, except in relation to sending you marketing by email or text message. You have the right to withdraw your consent to marketing at any time either by contacting us, clicking the unsubscribe link in an email or replying to a text message with the required words notified to you in each text message.
Specifically, we will use your personal data as follows:
contact details: to respond to your enquiry, contact you in relation to a story or media that you have contributed or administer our contract with you (as appropriate)
bank account details: to make any payment that we have agreed to make to you
correspondence: to communicate with you in relation to your enquiry, story or contract
biographical information and images: to investigate, author and publish journalistic, artistic and/or literary works (subject to the exemptions noted below)
5. Exemptions
Data protection law strives to achieve a balance between individuals’ right to privacy and freedom of expression. Although we are required to preserve the confidentiality and security of personal data provided to or obtained by us, the Data Protection Act 2018 includes important exemptions from a number of data protection obligations, including the obligation to provide individuals with information about how we process their personal data, for the purposes of journalism, artistic and literary purposes.
In order to rely on the exemption, we must show that we processed your personal data (or that of a third party, where relevant) with a view to publication that we reasonably believe to be in the public interest and that complying with various obligations under data protection law would be incompatible with processing personal data for journalistic purposes.
SWNS honours the Independent Press Standard Organisation Editors’ Code of Practice, even though it is not a member of IPSO.
6. Who we share your personal data with
We will share your personal data with appropriate members of staff within our organisation.
We also share your personal data with:
where you are an agent or work for one of our customers or suppliers, other businesses within the SWNS Media Group, including 72 Point and OnePoll
service providers including our hosting provider and email marketing platform
HM Revenue & Customs, the tax authority in the UK who require reporting of our processing activities in certain circumstances
any third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or assets or third parties we may seek to acquire or merge with (if any change happens to our business, the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this policy)
7. Where your personal data are stored
We do not transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.
8. How we keep your personal data secure
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We also limit access to your personal data to those within our organisation that have a need to access it. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are required to keep your personal data confidential.
Please note that any correspondence with us by email or telephone is not encrypted. If you have any particular concerns regarding the security of your correspondence with us, please let us know.
9. How long we keep your personal data for
We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary in connection with the purposes we collected it for and to comply with any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine how long we keep your personal data for, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which it was collected and the potential risk of harm from us continuing to keep it.
Any email correspondence that we have had with you will be stored on our email servers, archived and then deleted in accordance with our back-up and retention policies.
If we have paid you anything, we will retain details of the transaction for a period of six years from the date of the transaction order for tax purposes.
We will retain personal data relating to email marketing data until you unsubscribe or your email address has become permanently unavailable. Once you have unsubscribed, we will keep a record of your choice indefinitely to ensure that you do not receive any further emails from us.
We may retain any data that does not identify you indefinitely.
