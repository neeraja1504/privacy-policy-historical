SHRM collects technical information relating to each time a visitor comes to a SHRM Website, including IP address, browser type and version, time zone settings, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform type (e.g. Internet Explorer browser on a Windows platform).
We may also collect information about your visit, including pages you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page, and any phone number used to call our customer service number.
Gathering this technical information helps us to learn what browsers we need to support and helps us determine what sections of SHRM Websites are most popular and how many visitors come to our site(s). You do not have to register with SHRM Websites before we can collect this information.
b)     Information You Give Us
You may provide Personal Information to us which may include your name, home and/or work email address, postal address, phone number and/or fax number, your employer and job title, demographic information about you including birth year, certification designation, etc., and if you are making a purchase, your credit card information. You are only required to provide such information if you want to take advantage of optional products and services provided through SHRM Websites.
SHRM collects Personal Information in the following ways from different parts of the SHRM Websites:
SHRM Membership Applications:  You are sharing Personal Information with us when you join SHRM or renew your SHRM membership through the SHRM Websites. SHRM members will have SHRM membership log-in credentials which enable members to take advantage of restricted content and features on SHRM Websites.
Exchange Visitor Program Applications: Host Organizations (the entity hosting an exchange visitor) and Exchange Visitor Trainees/Interns use SHRM's online application system to provide SHRM with all information required to process the applications.  The information collected is subject to change over time, based on applicable laws and regulations.  In addition to the terms of this Privacy Policy, any information provided pursuant to an application is governed by the terms of the Exchange Visitor Program Privacy Policy.
Other Registration:  When registering for specific services we may ask for the same type of Personal Information. For example, if you subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, we will ask you to provide your e-mail address.
Online Purchases:  When you make a purchase using the SHRMStore or when you subscribe to a SHRM publication through the SHRM websites we may also ask for the same type of Personal Information. The number and variety of useful services on SHRM Websites that may require the collection of Personal Information about you will continue to grow in the future.
2.      What are "cookies" and how does SHRM use them?
A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer. This unique number identifies your web browser to SHRM computers whenever you visit SHRM Websites.
The use of cookies is an industry standard, and cookies are currently used on most major websites. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse to accept cookies altogether.
While SHRM does not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that certain services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies. To help serve you better, SHRM generally uses cookies to:
Identify return visitors. Cookies let us remember your web browser so we can provide personalized member services such as My SHRM and SHRM search agents. Cookies also allow us to identify SHRM members who are returning to the site.
Display advertisements. SHRM uses an outside ad company to display SHRM-approved ads on our website and other websites.

b.   in some cases members may receive products or services, which are paid for by their government employer, and as a result of payment by the government employer, the record must be open for public access pursuant to applicable law, such as the Florida Public Records Act, and SHRM will share such information pursuant to those laws
c.   in some cases members who are veterans may receive products or services, which are paid for by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and as a result of payment by the VA, the record must be made available to the VA pursuant to VA regulation, and for processing payment, and SHRM will share such information pursuant to such regulations.
b)     Site Use Information
As mentioned above, SHRM uses the aggregate, anonymous data collected to let our sponsors/advertisers know the number of impressions or views and the number of "click throughs" on their advertisement(s).
SHRM also uses this aggregate, anonymous data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of visitors to SHRM Websites; to measure user interests regarding specific areas of SHRM Websites; and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.
Without such data, we would not know which parts of SHRM Websites are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.
c)     Information Collected in Connection with Certification and Recertification
If you register for certification or recertification services, or for any other SHRM credential or certificate (e.g. SHRM California Specialty Credential), SHRM uses any Personal Information you may provide doing so in the same manner as we do when you register for other SHRM products and services.  Without limitation of the foregoing, SHRM (and/or SHRM's certification or credential-related vendors) may use and disclose Personal Information, certification exam performance information, and/or assessment information related to any other SHRM credential or certificate in connection with (the following is a non-exclusive list of examples):
Listing all individuals who have achieved a SHRM certification in the SHRM Online Certified Directory

The preparation, review, updating, validation, accreditation and/or administration of the exams and exam preparation materials
Publishing information regarding a candidate/certificant/credential-holder/certificate-holder against whom disciplinary action has been taken and the reason for that action.

SHRM will not disclose any Personal Information related to requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA, or under similar Non-US requirements, other than as reasonably necessary to review and/or provide that accommodation.
However, SHRM may disclose the above information as reasonably necessary in relation to the administration of the exam and exam program (e.g. to communicate ADA accommodations to our exam testing centers as necessary); to comply with the law, regulation, pursuant to court order or other legal process; in connection with the preparation, review, updating, validation, accreditation and/or administration of the exam or exam preparation materials; or to protect the rights, property or safety of SHRM, our members, certificants or others.
**d)     Exceptions           **
On occasion SHRM collects Personal Information through SHRM Websites with the intent to afford a greater degree of privacy for such information than is otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.
In those relatively rare situations where SHRM does so it will clearly disclose to you at the time it collects such information, what degree of privacy will be afforded to the Personal Information collected at such time; and SHRM will follow a process to assure that the specifically disclosed degree of privacy is in fact afforded to such information.
For example, SHRM may collect survey information through a survey where SHRM's use of any Personal Information from that survey is more limited than the general SHRM Privacy Statement would otherwise allow; in such a case, SHRM will disclose the stricter privacy policy governing that survey information at the time such Personal Information is collected from the survey respondent.

The "cookies" and other tracking devices used by SHRM Websites and described in Part I above do not apply to Personal Information gathered through channels other than SHRM Websites.
