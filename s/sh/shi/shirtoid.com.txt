Shirtoid Privacy Statement
Version 1.0
Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to Shirtoid and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding Shirtoid’s commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
User Information
During your visit to the site, Shirtoid does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you leave comments. However, even then, Shirtoid does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.
Shirtoid does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, with dial-up accounts, usually changes every time you connect). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties, or available to anybody outside of the Shirtoid staff.
Cookies
Shirtoid, along with thousands of other Web sites, may use cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to leave a comment.
Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by Shirtoid staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without Shirtoid’s knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.
Third-party Ad Server
A portion of the advertisements displayed on the Shirtoid website are served by third-party advertisers, including Commission Junction, Google, LinkShare, and other sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site.
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and other sites on the Internet.
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
We are committed to continuing to protect the privacy of our readers.If you have any additional questions, please contact us.
We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as Shirtoid may update it from time to time without notice to its users.
