4. Personal Data We Process
We collect personal data that (a) you actively submit to us as a customer, (b) we receive from our customers, and (c) we obtain for marketing purposes for potential clients, customers or others. We may process your personal data with or without automatic means, including collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of your personal data.
Actively submitted data. You submit personal data to us when you register an account with us through our websites, purchase our services, or engage in other interactions or communications with our organization. We generally process name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, and payment information.
We may also process identification information in order to verify your identity in the event that there is a risk of fraud or a regulatory requirement to verify such. Identification information may include photo, passport number, photocopy or electronic copy of the passport, driver's license number, driver's license photocopy or electronic copy, national ID number, photocopy or electronic copy of utility bills or other documentation requested for this purpose. Identification information is collected only as needed. A failure to provide identification information as requested may impact the status of your account with us.
You may provide us with additional information to participate at your own initiative in surveys, feedback comments, online chat services, promotions or other activities. Participation in surveys, feedback comments, online chat services, promotion or other similar activities is optional. If you do not wish to participate in, or provide personal data in connection with such activities, this will not affect your account status or ability to use available services. In each such case you will know what personal data you provide us with because you actively and voluntarily submit the data.
We also offer our customers registered under our Affiliate Program commissions for referring new customers to us who use our services. Upon registration in the affiliate program they are assigned a URL with a unique Affiliate ID to use in their own marketing efforts. That affiliate ID is then tied to any new account registration sourced from the affiliate's URL. The data of customers who sign-up through an Affiliate is treated the same as if the customer sought us out directly.
Data received from our Customers. Customers identify a 'Ship-to' party and delivery destination for packages that we ship at their request. The 'Ship-to' party and delivery address do not need to match the personal information provided by the customer upon registration. The main reasons for the personal information differing is where the customer is purchasing and shipping products on behalf of another person, as a gift for another person, or to another person who will receive the products on their behalf. The personal information collected generally includes the name, physical address and phone number of the 'Ship-to' party. Processing of this personal data is performed on behalf of the customer and for the purpose of providing the services requested by the customer. No active marketing is performed on personal data of the 'Ship-to' party.
Data obtained for marketing purposes for potential clients, customers or others. We obtain marketing data that we use to reach out to inform potential clients, customers and others of the services offered by our organization. The personal data collected generally includes the email address of a potential client, customer or contact and may also include their name and phone number.
Personal Data not actively collected or Processed. We do not actively collect or otherwise process personal data from minors and include in our Terms and Conditions a condition that the customer is not a minor and does not provide personal data of minors. The age of a minor varies by country. For the purposes of personal data collected from the European Union, the age of a minor is under age sixteen (16).
We do not actively collect or otherwise process special categories of personal data as identified in the GDPR including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, or genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
We do not actively collect or otherwise process personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences.

7. Sharing of Personal Data
We share your personal data with other parties in the following circumstances:
Third-Party Providers. We may provide personal data to third parties for their processing in performing functions on our behalf (for example, logistics, insurance, payments, security, data analysis, surveys, and so forth). In such instances, the providers will be contractually required to protect personal data from additional processing (including for marketing purposes) and transfer in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable laws. This may include transfers or onward transfers to third parties that are outside of the EEA and outside of the United States. In these circumstances, relevant protections approved under the GDPR will be undertaken to protect your personal data. Under certain data protection laws, including the GDPR, Shipito is liable if a third-party provider that we have engaged to process personal data fails to fulfil its data protection obligations.
Organizational Entities. We may transfer personal data from Shipito to Global Access, LLC, in order to facilitate logistics and related services. A data sharing and processing agreement has been concluded between the two entities to ensure that Global Access, LLC, is contractually required to protect personal data from additional processing and transfer outside of the purposes stipulated by Shipito.
Legal Requirements. We may access and disclose your personal data to regulatory bodies if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required under regulation. This may include screening against the Consolidated Screening List for which the United States Government maintains restrictions on certain exports, re-exports or transfers of items. This may also include submitting personal data required by local customs authorities and tax authorities. Additionally, we may disclose your personal data and other information as required by law, including in response to lawful requests by public authorities or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal data to exercise or defend legal rights; to take precautions against liability; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the resource, of any individual, or of the general public; to maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure; to protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; or to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations.
8. Storage of Personal Data
We may store your personal data in data centers in the United States, cloud storage solutions, or on our premises, including corporate offices and warehouses. To ensure the adequacy of protection of data that we transfer between Shipito and Global Access, LLC, we have concluded a data transfer and processing agreement between these entities. You may be entitled to review our data sharing and processing agreements if you contact us per the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Statement. We endeavor to utilize third-party service providers from the United States that have certified with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
9. Personal Data Security

We regularly consider appropriate new security technology and methods as we maintain and develop our software and systems. Security measures implemented include:
SSL is used on all pages where personal data is collected;
Data requiring a higher level of protection, such as payment card account numbers and passport numbers, is encrypted prior to transmission to the database for storage;
Web and database servers are protected using firewalls;
Passwords used for account registration cannot be 'defaulted';
User access is tracked;
Role-based security is applied to system access;
All employees are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of personal data accessible through their employment;
Regular system backups are made;
Regular maintenance is performed on systems; and
Systems are monitored for security.
10. Retention of Personal Data
Shipito retains collected personal data for a reasonable period of time to fulfill the processing purposes mentioned above. Personal data is then archived for time periods required or necessitated by law or legal considerations. When archival is no longer required, personal data is deleted from our records.
Shipito offers you a choice to sign up with a Free Account or a paid Premium Membership. The Premium Membership offers either monthly or annual subscription payment options.
For Free Accounts, the account is automatically deactivated and deleted if there has not been any activity on the account for a 2-year period. The time period of 2 years is selected based upon typical customer trends, where some customers may only choose to use the services on occasion. This period is also necessary to accommodate customers who have been required to verify their identity so that this process does not have to be started over with a new account unnecessarily. If you wish us to deactivate your account sooner than this time period, please contact us. Our contact details are provided at the end of this Privacy Statement.
For Premium Membership, fees are automatically charged to the account on file per the monthly or annual subscription option selected. At any time, you may choose to change your account to a Standard account. If the account fees are unpaid, the Premium account automatically changes to a Standard account, which automatically deactivates and deletes if there has not been any activity on the account for a 2-year period. If you wish us to deactivate your account sooner than this time period, please contact us. Our contact details are provided at the end of this Privacy Statement.
We continue to retain personal data that we are required to retain in order to meet our regulatory obligations including tax records and transaction history. We comply with the Retention Policy of our parent company Global Access Group, LLC, which is regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with our obligations under data protection laws and other regulatory requirements. We regularly audit our databases and archived information to ensure that personal data is only stored and archived in alignment with the Retention Policy.
11. Personal Data Rights
We rely upon our customers maintaining the accuracy of the personal data they provide through our website, www.shipito.com, including the ability to add, edit and delete contact, payment and delivery information. Where you are the account holder, you may view and edit the personal data you have provided by accessing your account online under the Account Profile menu online.
You may reach out to the customer that provided your personal data and request that they make any required update under the Account Profile menu of their registered account, including deletion of your personal data. This typically occurs where you have received delivery of a package that was arranged by another person.
For marketing communication an 'unsubscribe' option is provided in the footer of every marketing communication. In addition, we may be contacted directly to unsubscribe. Our contact details are provided at the end of this Privacy Statement.
You may also contact us with your personal data inquiries or for assistance in modifying or updating your personal data and to exercise additional statutory rights such as: access, rectification, data portability, objection, processing restriction, and erasure of your personal data.
