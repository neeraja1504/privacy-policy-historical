Voluntary Participation
In some cases where you choose to make your own information available to other visitors, you do so at your own risk and Shinjiru.COM believes that it is beyond reasonable doubt that you are aware of such risk. Such cases include, but are not limited to your participation as a user of the classified ads, forums or hyper-linked website on this website.
At our advertisers request, you may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information to participate in the advertisers' promotions or surveys etc. Shinjiru.COM may collect on behalf of the advertisers your personal information. If this does occur, Shinjiru.COM will make reasonable attempts to highlight this to you, by way of a clause in the instructions, beside the "submit" button or similarly prominent areas regarded as noticable by Shinjiru.COM. Should you dispute our judgement of noticability, please do not participate in the promotion or survey etc. You can email to us for an inquiry.
