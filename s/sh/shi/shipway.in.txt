Cookies
Like many other websites, Shipway.in uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your hard drive and not on our site. They can help make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies let you keep shopping cart information independent from our servers. They help us understand how customers use our service, which allows us to improve and tailor the service. You will not be able to use Shipway.in service if you disable cookies.
Disclosure of Information
We do not sell, rent, or loan your information to third parties without your permission. So, for example, we do not sell your email address or other information to mass marketers. Members of the Shipway.in will be allowed to contact you with special offers and information related to products you have bought or shopped for.
Security Procedures
Shipway.in has built-in security measures to protect your information from loss, misuse, and alteration. We use industry-standard practices, such as encrypted storage and password protection systems, to safeguard the confidentiality of information.
Security Standards
Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that the information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. We do not accept credit card numbers delivered by email. You should never send credit card information by email, as it is not secure.
