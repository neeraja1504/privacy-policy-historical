Any information provided by you will be used for shipmychip.com purposes only.
However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order used for delivering specific services to you (for example the courier partner that delivers your order).
Shipmychip will not share information about you with any individual or other companies (such as direct mail organizations or other third parties) unless required by law.
There are times when we may request information from you, such as your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry, accept an order, conduct a survey or allow you to access specific information such as account information, etc.
We at Shipmychip do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal information you do supply to us.  You can help us update and maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by logging in to the site and updating your account pages or notifying us about any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address.
