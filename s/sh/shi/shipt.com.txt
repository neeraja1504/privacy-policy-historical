Privacy Policy - Shipt Same Day Delivery
Shipt, Inc. maintains two separate privacy policies, applicable to its Members and Shoppers.  Shipt’s Services are used by members, whom have subscribed to the Shipt membership service and are enabled to order and receive product delivery through use of the Shipt platform (“Members”), and shoppers, to whom Shipt provides Shipt Technology Services (as defined in the applicable agreement between Shipt and each shopper) and are enabled to accept Member orders, shop for and deliver products to Members (“Shoppers”). To the extent an individual is both a Member and a Shopper, the Services being utilized will determine the applicable privacy policy.

Thank you for using Shipt! Shipt, Inc. (“Shipt”) values our Members and we recognize the importance of making sure you know how we handle your information. Our Member Privacy Policy explains: (1) what information we collect; (2) how we use it; (3) how we may share it; (4) how we protect it; and (5) what choices we offer.
When this Privacy Policy Applies
This Member Privacy Policy applies to Shipt’s data collection during use of our shopping platform and delivery services, including www.shipt.com, the Shipt mobile application, and other Shipt-related sites, mobile applications, communications, capabilities and services (“Services”).  By using the Services, you signify your acceptance of this Member Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Member Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.  We may change or add to our Member Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically.
Our Member Privacy Policy does not apply to sites linked from our Services or to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you. Our Member Privacy Policy also does not cover the information practices of other companies or individuals who advertise our Services.
Information We Collect
As part of the Services, various information is collected from you, through automated collection, and from third party sources.  Examples of when information, including personal information, is collected include:
Form completion;
Account registration or updates;
Identity verification;
Access or use of the Services (e.g., place orders, search for products, pay for orders);
Communications with Shipt; and
SMS communications between a Member and a Shipt Shopper that are made using the Services.
We may combine or associate information we collect. We use the term “personal information” to refer to any information that identifies or can be used to identify you. Common examples of personal information include: full name, home address, email address, and phone number. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with information, your ability to use our Services may be limited.
Information You Give to Us
You may choose to provide us with information (including Personal Information) about yourself, such as your name, home address or other physical addresses you may select to associate with your account, email, phone number, date of birth, zip or postal code, user name and password, and payment card information. This type of information is typically collected when completing forms on our platform, placing orders, or communicating with Shipt.  You may also choose to submit to Shipt the email address of individuals whom you believe may be interested in becoming a Member – you are responsible for ensuring the submission of these emails are appropriate and permissible.
You may choose to use the interactive and social features that Shipt offers, which permit you to access the Services, submit content and communicate with Shipt.  Doing so provides Shipt with information such as name, e-mail address, and public profile information. Please note that when you post information in these interactive and social features, the content may be publicly accessible or accessible to other users.
Information We Obtain from Your Use of Our Services
When you use our Services, either through your internet browser or the mobile app, we collect certain information automatically, such as your internet protocol address, device identifier, operating system version, browser type, internet service provider, location, clickstream data, and details of how you use the Services (e.g., search terms, pages visited).
Geo-Location.  For location information, we may collect and process general information (e.g., zip code) and information that is more specific (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the platform or specific features of the platform).  If you do not want your mobile device to provide us with location tracking information when you access the platform, then please follow the instructions in the “Your Choices” section below.
Cookies and Similar Technologies. We and our partners use various technologies to automatically collect and store information when you interact with or use our Services, including use of cookies, web beacons, mobile SDKs or similar technologies.
_Cookies. When you access our Services, Shipt will issue a cookie to your device.  A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Services. _
Web Beacons. Certain webpages maintained by Shipt, as well as emails sent by Shipt, may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that collect information about page visits and email viewing. Information collected may include limited personal information, such as name, email, and universal ID.
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. Shipt collects information from its mobile application users through deployment of mobile SDKs. A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see “Web Beacons” above). The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed.
We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services from our partners, such as advertising and analytics. We may use this technology to deliver or help our partners deliver interest-based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) through mobile applications and browsers based on how you browse and shop online. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way, please follow the instructions in the “Your Choices” section below.
Do Not Track Policy. Some browsers have a ”do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser ”do not track” signals.

Examples of how we use the information we collect include:
Supporting the shopping and delivery process, including fulfilling orders, processing payment, verifying eligibility to buy certain products, communicating with Shoppers and providing customer service to users;
Authorizing access to our Services;
Providing Members with personalized Services;
