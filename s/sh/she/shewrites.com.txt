The Site contains links to other sites where personal information is or may be collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your Personal Information or PII will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site and not be this Privacy Policy.

“Cookies” or Web Beacons — if SHEWRITES sends you cookies, what are they and how does SHEWRITES use them?   What are Web Beacons and how does SHEWRITES use them?
Cookies are small pieces of text that store information specific to your browsing session with SHEWRITES.  A cookie does not contain code or any other malicious data.  We utilize this recurring information to customize your browser experience while you are utilizing SHEWRITES resources, and it ensures the proper credentials are being used to secure your information from unwanted viewers.  The majority of information SHEWRITES retrieves from your cookies is contained in “Session Cookies” and is not permanently stored or remembered.
A Web Beacon is an embedded object that is usually attached to an image or framing object.  In many cases, this embedded code pulls an image or other object from a third party site and is generally used in user tracking.  Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our Site and our advertising. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our Site from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our Site after viewing a particular advertisement or posting, or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns by measuring click-throughs and the frequency that these emails are forwarded.
The information we or our contractors collect through web beacons may include some limited personal information.  They also allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our Site and undertake internal research.
We may allow third parties to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on our Site or otherwise placed by us, to enable such third parties to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to allow such third parties to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in an action on the advertiser's site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with such third parties for this research.
SHEWRITES may hire other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction ("third-party advertisement servers"). They are not authorized by SHEWRITES to collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviors associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to and may have their own privacy policies.
SHEWRITES may allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Products and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies. Should you have any complaints about the practices of any of these companies you should contact privacy@shewrites.com.
When you receive an email from SHEWRITES, we may track whether you opened that email and clicked on any links included in the email.
