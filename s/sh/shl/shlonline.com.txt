Collection of personal data
In general, you can visit SHL websites without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. However there may be occasions when you choose to give us personal information. Generally this will be for the purposes of:
receiving further information from us;
for recruitment, selection and development purposes by potential employers, managing recruitment and human resource processes and any related purpose where you have consented to the collection.
We do not collect information about our visitors from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organisations. We do not collect or use personal data for any purpose other than those indicated above and will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose, we offer you the means to consent to this new purpose by indicating in a box at the point on the site where personal data is collected.
Use and disclosure
If we require you to provide certain personal information about yourself for the purposes described above, we will not rent, sell or exchange information about you to third parties except to your employers or potential employers, where you consent, where you would reasonably expect the information to be disclosed or where we are legally required to disclose such information
Cookies and automatic data collection
We may automatically log personal data or link information automatically logged by other means with personal data about specific individuals. However, we will only use this information to help us respond to queries you may have about our products or services or to tell you about other SHL products and services that we think you may be interested in. We will not pass this information on to any third parties.
The Internet browser that you use may make use of a feature called a "cookie" to assign identification to your computer. We do not use cookies to store personal data or to link personal data to non-personal data, unless you have first agreed to this by selecting the "Remember Me" option. If you select this option, a cookie will be placed on your computer which will allow our website online.shl.com to recognise you when you return to our website. No personal information will be stored in this cookie.
We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit www.aboutcookies.org for detailed guidance.
The following table describes the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently we operate an ‘implied consent’ policy which means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete SHL cookies having visited the site.

| Remembers products you add to your basket. Helps control access and controls where you are in the process. Used to remember your email address to speed up sign-in next time you visit the site (but only if you tick 'Remember Me').
External web services : We use a number of external web services on the SHL site, mostly to display content within our web pages. For example, to display slideshows we sometimes use SlideShare; to show videos we use YouTube. This is not an exhaustive or complete list of the services we use, or might use in the future, when embedding content, but these are the most common. As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.
Email tracking : Some emails we can track, at an individual level, whether the user has opened and clicked on the email. We rarely use the latter information at a personal level, rather we use it to understand open and click rates on our emails to try and improve them. Sometimes we do use the personal information e.g. to re-email people who didn’t click the first time. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked then you should opt out of SHL’s emails which you can do via unsubscribe option in the footer of emails we send.
Log Files
Like most web site providers, we analyse server log files to collect statistical information about how our web sites are used. This type of information is collected only at an aggregate level and includes browser types, Internet service providers, referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps and other broad demographic data. Such data is not linked to personally identifiable information.
Security
We protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information and we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to do so. SHL operates its own Internet Data Centre that is designed to keep mission critical human resource services and data online and secure at all times. We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from:
Unauthorized access
Improper use or disclosure
Unauthorised modification
Unlawful destruction or accidental loss
All our employees and data processors, who have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data, are required to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data.
We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation.
