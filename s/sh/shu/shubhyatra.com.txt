Fare Watcher tracks the prices of airline tickets to your favourite places. When the price for one of your favourite trips changes based on your preferences, Shubhyatra.com will notify you of the change via email. Your email address and preferred round trip city pairs are necessary to receive Fare Watcher emails.
