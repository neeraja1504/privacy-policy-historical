Shure uses cookies to improve performance and enhance the user experience for those who visit our website. Our Cookie Policy does clarify how we do this and how cookies are managed.
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page in order to provide shopping functionality, help analyse the website’s performance and to recommend content relevant to your visit. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit.
We use cookies to record the existence of a browsing session and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites. Cookies can, however, be used to create a usage profile. In this case, you will be informed about this in this privacy policy (please also refer to the sections "Log Files”, “Website Analytics” and “Advertising by means of tracking technologies”.
If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or in most web browsers you can choose to turn off all or some cookies via your browser settings. Also, depending on what type of web browser and what browser version you are using, you may be able to change the properties on your cookie file so that cookies are not used or saved. Cookies can also be removed from your hard drive. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.
Like most websites, if you decline to accept cookies, some of our services may not function properly (for example, you will not be able to log on to any part of the website which is accessible only to registered users). Where you are unable to log on to the website due to your declining cookies, you can still place orders by contacting customer service.
For further information on the use of cookies and how they are managed, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
We require aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. For this purpose, we use the website analytics tools described in this section. The tools either do not collect IP addresses or anonymize these upon collection and any profiles created by these tools only contain aggregate data. The service providers providing these tools are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business and subject to our instructions.
You will find information below on each tool's provider and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data by the respective tool. Please note that tools may use so-called opt out cookies in order to remember your objection. This opt out function relates to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time. In case you use several terminal devices or browsers you must opt out on every device and in every browser used. Note that in case you remove all cookies from your hard drive, your “opt out” might not work any longer.
Alternatively, you can avoid the creation of usage profiles by website analytics tools by generally deactivating cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the section "Cookies" or to our "Cookie Policy".
