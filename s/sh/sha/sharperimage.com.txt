Sharper Image - Privacy and Security
This is the Website of SharperImage.com
Our postal address is:
Sharperimage.com
27725 Stansbury Boulevard - Suite #175
Farmington Hills, MI 48334
We can be reached via customerservice@sharperimageonline.com or you can reach us by telephone at 1-877-714-7444, our customer service line, Monday - Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST.
Sharperimage.com is committed to protecting your privacy. In order to complete your order or to satisfy your request for information, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We offer 1024-bit SSL encryption, which encrypts your personal and credit card information as it is transferred over the Internet.
We electronically verify each order with the credit company, returning an order confirmed message only if the issuing bank authorizes it. Our experienced staff then manually checks all orders which still appear unusual, canceling any order we feel is not valid.
Security
If you are ever a victim of credit card fraud, the Fair Credit Act specifies that your credit card company can hold you liable for no more than $50 in fraudulent charges to your account. With sharperimage.com, you'll be reimbursed for any amount up to $50 billed to you by your credit card company for fraudulent charges to your account if the credit card number was obtained from purchases made at sharperimage.com while using our secure server. For this protection, you must promptly notify your credit card company of any fraudulent charges and follow the procedures for doing so as outlined in your credit card agreement.
How You Can Tell You're Browsing a Secure Website
In order to be sure that information transferred between your browser and the SharperImage.com server is secure, it is important to be aware of the security information available to you through your browser. Once you enter the Checkout process (when you're ready to purchase the items you have put into your shopping basket), your connection to our server becomes secure. To confirm this, look at the bottom of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser) you can be sure that your information is secure. You can also ensure security by checking the URL line of your browser. When you enter the secure area of our site, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".
Data Collection in a Secure Environment
In several areas of our site, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. These areas include: Checkout, where we ask for name, address, email, credit card and other information needed to complete your order. Email Registration, where we ask for your email address. Registration, where we give you the opportunity to store your bill-to and ship-to details (up to 99 ship-to addresses for easy online gift giving) and securely store credit card information for faster online ordering using quick checkout and the opportunity to bid in our online auctions.
Once you've registered, you may click on Account Info (at the top of any page) to edit or delete your personal information. All information relating to our customers is stored in a secure environment separate from our Website.
Data Use
The information we collect is used to improve our Website, to notify consumers about updates to our Website and for special offers and promotions. Also, sharperimage.com may provide aggregate statistics about our online sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these general statistics will include no personally identifying information.

We occasionally share our customer postal mailing lists with select companies that might interest you. If you prefer that we not share your name, please call customer service at 1-877-714-7444 to be removed from the list.

Please note that such requests may take up to 8 to 12 weeks to become effective. In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not mail" file to ensure that we can honor your request. Please also note that when you make a purchase, we will send you emails to confirm your order and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order.
From time to time we make portions of our customer mailing lists, which include name and street address, available to carefully screened companies. This may include your name and postal address, but never your email address. By purchasing online, you are automatically added to our catalog mailing list. You may also receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events.
