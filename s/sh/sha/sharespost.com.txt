ACCOUNT OPEN DISCLOSURES
IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
This notice answers some questions about SharesPost Financial Corporation’s Customer Identification Program.
What types of information will I need to provide?
When you open an account, your firm is required to collect the following information:
Name
Date of birth
Address
Identification number:
U.S. citizen: taxpayer identification number (Social Security number or employer identification number)
Non-U.S. citizen: taxpayer identification number; passport number and country of issuance; alien identification card number; or government-issued identification showing nationality, residence and a photograph of you.
You may also need to provide your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
A corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity may need to provide other information, such as its principal place of business, local office, employer identification number, certified articles of incorporation, government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust agreement.
U.S. Department of the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and New York Stock Exchange rules already require you to provide most of this information. These rules also may require you to provide additional information, such as your net worth, annual income, occupation, employment information, investment experience and objectives, and risk tolerance.
What happens if I don’t provide the information requested or my identity can’t be verified?
SharesPost Financial Corporation may not be able to open an account or carry out transactions for you. If your firm has already opened an account for you, they may have to close it.
We thank you and appreciate your support of the financial industry’s efforts to deny terrorists and money launderers access to America’s financial system.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN SUMMARY
SharesPost Financial Corporation has developed a Business Continuity Plan describing how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.
Contacting Us:
If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at (800) 279-7754 or at our email address, info@sharespost.com, you should go to our web site at sharespost.com.
Our Business Continuity Plan:
We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption. Our business continuity plan addresses: data back-up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their securities if we are unable to continue our business. Our electronic hosting and compliance providers back up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by these service providers that their objective is to restore their own operations within one hour. Facilitating your transactions could be delayed during and following this period.
Varying Disruptions:
Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within one hour. In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within six hours. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, and notify you through our web site at www.sharespost.com, on how to contact us. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you as soon as quickly as practicable.
For more information:
If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at (650) 492-6869.
