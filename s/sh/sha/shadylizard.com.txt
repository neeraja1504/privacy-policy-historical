This Privacy Policy applies to Media Breakaway’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Media Breakaway on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the “Website”), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Media Breakaway’s other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Media Breakaway is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.
By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Website Terms of Use.

1. Collection of Information.
1.1 Survey Information.
Media Breakaway collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Media Breakaway survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Media Breakaway or a third party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to Media Breakaway, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). Media Breakaway may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Media Breakaway or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Media Breakaway or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Media Breakaway.
1.2 Third Party List Information.
Media Breakaway collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Media Breakaway subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the “Seller”). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, “Third Party List Information”). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Media Breakaway seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Media Breakaway and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when Media Breakaway obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Media Breakaway or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Media Breakaway’s customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Media Breakaway service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
Media Breakaway currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Media Breakaway may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).
(a) Cookies.   A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Media Breakaway to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Media Breakaway’s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.
(b) Web Beacons.   A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an  programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Media Breakaway to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Media Breakaway might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Media Breakaway’s database, visits the fishing website, Media Breakaway receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Media Breakaway would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. Media Breakaway may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Media Breakaway also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Media Breakaway’s database.
(c) New Technology.   The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Media Breakaway’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Media Breakaway strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.
1.5 Outside Information.
Media Breakaway may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of Media Breakaway including information located in public databases (“Outside Information”).
1.6 Individual Information.
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Media Breakaway gathers or receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.
Media Breakaway will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Media Breakaway obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Media Breakaway has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. Media Breakaway has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
1.8 Credit Card Information.
Media Breakaway may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”) when an individual places an order from Media Breakaway. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Media Breakaway, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Media Breakaway will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

This information helps Media Breakaway to better understand the online habits of individuals so that Media Breakaway can target advertising and promotions to them.
