This information is stored in log files and is collected automatically. We may combine this information from your browser or your mobile device with other information that we or our partners collect about you, including across devices. This information is used to prevent fraud and to keep the Website secure, to analyze and understand how the Services work for our Users, and to provide advertising, including across your devices, and a more customized Website experience for members and visitors.

You can control which optional messages you choose to receive via the unsubscribe link in our emails.
If you no longer wish to use the Website or purchase Services from us or receive service-related messages (except for legally required notices), then you may close your account.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
SharePoint Maven does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
SharePoint Maven may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or provided marketing services, such as MailChimp. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide services to SharePoint Maven, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
SharePoint Maven may disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SharePoint Maven or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of SharePoint Maven; and/or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SharePoint Maven, or the public.
Automatically Collected Information
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by SharePoint Maven. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality of the Website, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the SharePoint Maven Website.
Use of Cookies
The SharePoint Maven Website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize SharePoint Maven pages, or register with SharePoint Maven site or purchase Services, a cookie helps SharePoint Maven to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same SharePoint Maven website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SharePoint Maven features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SharePoint Maven Services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
SharePoint Maven secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
In addition, access to your data is restricted to need-to-access individuals.
We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed. Please note that non-encrypted communication using email is not secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee data security in email communication and, therefore, recommend using physical mail for confidential information.
International Transfer
We operate globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed via servers located in the United States. The Canada, the United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the United States, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with U.S. law.
To the extent that SharePoint Maven is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:
Model Clauses. The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing greg@sharepointmaven.com.
P rivacy Shield. SharePoint Maven does not participate in Privacy Shield at this time. However, SharePoint Maven may rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield to transfer personal information to some of our third-party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the Privacy Shield Program.
Necessary for the performance of the contract. SharePoint Maven provides a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to purchase the Services. However, if you want to purchase the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Sale which set out the contract between SharePoint Maven and its Customers. As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the United States) and may use technical infrastructure in the United States to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal information to the United States and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.
Children Under Thirteen ; Notice to Minors
SharePoint Maven does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use the Website and Services. We request that all users of the Website and our Services who are under the age of thirteen not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under thirteen has provided us with personally-identifiable information, we will delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our records. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor under your account.
In addition to protecting the privacy of children under age thirteen, we are committed to protect the privacy of minors. Though neither our Website nor our Services are not targeted to minors nor is it intended to be used by minors, if, for any reason, a minor has shared information via our Website and/or Services said minor may request and obtain removal of such information by contacting us at greg@sharepointmaven.com. Although we offer deletion capability, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information provided.
Do Not Track Disclosure
Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising as discussed in the “How to Opt-Out” section above, and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your Web browser as described in the “Use of Cookies” section below, some Web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the Websites you encounter while Web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to Web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about “do not track,” visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
Retention
SharePoint Maven will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account is active, as described in this policy, or as needed to provide the Services to you. If you no longer want SharePoint Maven to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account. SharePoint Maven will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.
E-mail Communications ; How to Opt-Out
From time to time, SharePoint Maven may contact you via email for the purpose of providing announcements, promotional offers, alerts, confirmations, surveys, and/or other general communication. In order to improve our Services, we may receive a notification when you open an email from SharePoint Maven or click on a link therein.
Please note that or marketing and promotional communications are opt-in. If you would like to stop receiving marketing or promotional communications via email from SharePoint Maven, you may opt out of such communications by clicking on the UNSUBSCRIBE link.
Email marketing campaigns published by us may contain tracking facilities within the actual email. Subscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for future analysis and evaluation. Such tracked activity may include but shall not be limited to: the opening of emails, forwarding of emails, the clicking of links within the email content, times, dates and frequency of activity. This information is used to refine future email campaigns and supply the User with more relevant content based around their activity.
Your Rights
You may benefit from a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. Some rights apply only in certain limited cases, depending on your location. If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so by contacting us.

In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.

If you need further assistance, you can contact SharePoint Maven through one of the channels listed below under “Contact Information.” We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.
