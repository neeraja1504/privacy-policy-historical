|  1.   What information does Shaadi.com collect/track about me?
Shaadi.com is an online matrimonial service designed to provide an easy way for our members to meet each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profiles and our matching technology provides them matches based on their pre-selected criteria. In order to do this, we ask for certain personal information which is displayed on the site. (This information includes physical / mental disability.) (Of course, all Shaadi.com visitors may browse the site, search member profiles and view any articles or features our site has to offer without entering any personal information.)Information Collected/Tracked by Shaadi.com

1. Information users submit; and
2. Information not directly submitted.

We define Public information as personal information that may be displayed on the site at the behest of the member, such as gender, age, height, photograph, etc. Private information is defined as any information that allows others to contact a user other than through Shaadi.com or allows the collection of information about the user other than what is displayed on the site.Public: To accomplish our goal of bringing compatible people together, we must gather personal information, which may or may not include: customer-specified Shaadi.com username, gender, age, religion, income range, occupation, preference/lifestyle information, general geographic location and photograph.Private:This information is gathered from members and guests who apply for the various services our site offers.

SURVEYS & CONTESTS: From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, and age).SHAADI.COM AFFILIATE PARTNERS: The Affiliate Partner program is a vehicle for other websites to link to Shaadi.com.

Shaadi.com takes every precaution to protect your information, both online and offline.
When our registration/order process asks you to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), such information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information offline.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
We have also done everything in our power to prevent misuse of photographs. Apart from not allowing photographs to be downloaded or copied, we have watermarked them with the Shaadi.com logo. This acts as a further deterrent for illegal use elsewhere.

Do make full use of this option, because your friends are also covered by Shaadi.com's spam-free privacy policy. We will use your friend's email address only to send your message to them.
