How Data is Used
Registration Information:
We use your Registration Information: a) to fulfill requests for our services; b) to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; c) to conduct research about the use of our services; d) to enable you to create an account, store log-in credentials, and customize your ShareThis services; e) to contact you from time to time about ShareThis services; and f) for ShareThis to provide offers for products and services of ShareThis and our partners that may be of interest to you.

Usage Data:
ShareThis uses the usage data we collect and information collected from our third-party partners to create audience segments and to otherwise enable interest-based advertising (“Usage Data”).
Audience segments are groups of users and certain general interest categories that we have inferred based on the following:
a) demographic or interest data
b) a general geographic location derived from your IP address
c) the pages you view and links you click, and/or search terms you enter when using certain services.
These audience segments do not contain Personal Information; they are tied to a device, not a person. Audience segments are not tied to Registration Information.
We may also employ Usage Data for research and development purposes, for our internal operational purposes, and to create aggregate statistics for market research or analytics services. These aggregated statistics do not include information that directly identifies an individual (although certain kind of data we collect would be considered as identifiable in the EU/EEA). We offer some of the Usage Data to Our customers for their own internal analytics or data modeling. In such cases, we contractually prohibit the customers from re-identifying you without your opt in consent.
