The Site is not directed at children, and we request that children under the age of 13 should not provide Personal Identifiable Information through the Site.
b) Security.  We have security measures and tools in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site.

We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by CCNL. If you provide Payment Information or other Personal Information through any such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party's web site (not the Site) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. It is important that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties.
