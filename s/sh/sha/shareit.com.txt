Any applicable data protection safeguards, as may be amended or replaced, for the transfers of data to Controllers established outside of the EU/EEA that do not ensure an adequate level of protection ( “Standard Contractual Clauses ”).

All DR MyCommerce, Inc. services may be used for lawful purposes only. Transmission, storage, or presentation of any information, data or material in violation of any United States Federal, State or City law is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, material we judge to be inappropriate, threatening, obscene, or of adult content. Or, material protected by trade secret and other statute. For the purposes of this document, it is focused on adult content.
Adult content, pornography and sex-related merchandising are prohibited on all Digital River sites. This includes sites that may infer sexual content or link to adult content elsewhere. Because the Internet is a global communication tool, it is difficult to dictate what is considered "adult content." It is not our function to discriminate against those who choose to utilize adult content or adult related material. However, DR MyCommerce, Inc. has chosen to enforce its "no adult sites/products" policy.
What is Adult Content?
Sexually explicit pictures, writing, or other material/products whose primary purpose is to cause sexual arousal.
Sexually explicit pictures, writing or any material/products that involves children (anyone under the age of 18) is strictly prohibited.
Photos, videos or animated depiction showing nudity in women or men for non-scientific or non-artistic purposes.
