Shadowville uses these cookies for a number of purposes, such as saving information about your language preference (so that you do not have to choose it every time you come to our site) or country (if applicable), authenticating registered users, supporting the mechanisms for our shopping cart and online ordering, delivering accurate marketing communications relevant to your interests, and enabling general traffic trend analysis. The cookies Shadowville uses do not contain any personally identifiable information and can not profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. You are not identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site.
While you do not need to allow your browser to accept cookies in order to browse much of our web site or to access many of our services, you must have cookies enabled if you wish to access content in languages other than English, shop online at our web store, or access any areas reserved for registered users. Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function as well as clear existing cookies. If you want to know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. As described above, turning off the cookie function will restrict the on-line services from Shadowville that you can use.
