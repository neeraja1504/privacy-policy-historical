Maintaining the security of your data is a priority at Venntro Inc. and we are committed to respecting your privacy rights. We pledge to handle your data fairly and legally at all times. Venntro Inc. is dedicated to being transparent about what data we collect about you and how we use it.
This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Use and any other documents referred to in it) outlines the manner in which we manage personal information obtained through or displayed on the Website or otherwise provided by users (“ you ”, “ your ”) of our dating and networking services (“ Services ”) via the Website. It applies whenever you visit this website, including any mobile website (together the “ Website ”), and provides you with information about:
what personal data we collect;
how we use your data;
how long we retain your data;
how we ensure your privacy is maintained; and
your legal rights relating to your personal data.
Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By using the Website, you are taken to have read and agreed to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Sharing your information with our other websites in the same network
Please note that to improve the opportunity to find a dating partner, our Services are operated through a number of other websites in addition to this Website (which may include all those operated by Venntro Media Group or any subsidiary of Venntro Media Group including, but not limited to, Woowise Ltd).
This means that when you sign up to our Services, any content you post to the Website will be searchable and available to users of the Services who access it via different websites in the same network as the Website. It also means that you may view and communicate with other members of the Services who have registered with and accessed the Service through different websites in the same network. You will have no control over which websites within a network your data is shared with, but you will always be able to block unwanted individuals from any website within the network from accessing your profile and interacting with you.
These will only be websites in the same network as this Website. These networks group you together with members of the Services according to certain classifications, so that your information will only be accessible to appropriate potential dating partners who have signed up through a Website providing compatible Services to this one.
By registering with this Website you acknowledge and accept that the personal information you provide in connection with the Service may be shared with our other websites in the manner described above.

How do we restrict access to your personal information on the Service?
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy and that of other users, and wherever possible we require you to provide login information and identify yourself to access the Website.
We also make an effort to ensure that members of the Service are not connected with other members that may be inappropriate. To do this we may apply classifications to Associated Websites that provide access to the Service, including to the Website. These classifications may restrict the availability of:
communications between yourself and other members of the Service;
the details of other members of the Service to yourself; and
your details to other members of the Service.
How long do you keep hold of my personal information?
We remove onsite activity periodically throughout your membership. If you delete your profile or your free profile is inactive for 18 months, all information is deleted from the account and from the Company’s records apart from your gender, sexuality and payment records (excluding card information), which are all retained by the Company in an anonymous way. Profile information is deleted from our servers within 10 hours from either the profile being deleted or inactive for 18 months, or if the profile is active, from yourself deleting or amending your personal information.
Do you transfer my personal data abroad?
All of your data is stored on our servers in the UK. However, a number of our suppliers (including providers of our content delivery, cloud platform, payment systems and mailing services) are based outside of the European Economic Area, which may require us to transfer your personal data to jurisdictions which are not subject to equivalent standards of data protection laws (including the US). Where such international transfers are necessary, we will ensure that these are made subject to appropriate safeguards (including by using EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses). All organisations who we transfer data to in the US are certified under the Privacy Shield framework. You can request further details about the safeguards we use when transferring your data abroad by contacting us at the details below, and view the list of Privacy Shield participants on https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Information and personal data may be intercepted, lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other people.
We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, we set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information once we have received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorised access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of personal information, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
