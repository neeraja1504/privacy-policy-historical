Use of Cookies: During a Customer’s interaction with one of Shaw’s Internet sites, Shaw may use a browser feature called a “cookie” to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on Shaw’s Web sites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies a Customer’s browser – but not the Customer him or herself – to Shaw’s computers each time a Customer visits one of the Shaw Web sites using cookies. Cookies tell Shaw which pages of its sites are visited and how many people visited each web page. This helps Shaw to enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw Web sites. Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for future visits.
When Shaw chooses to use Personal Information for a purpose not previously identified, Shaw will identify the new use. Unless such new use is required by law, the Consent of the Customer, Employee or Web Site User is required before the Personal Information can be used for that new purpose.
3.3 How does Shaw obtain your consent?
Consent is required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either expressed or implied. The form of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account the sensitivity of the information and the reasonable expectations of the Customer, Employee or Web Site User. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate when the Personal Information is less sensitive.
In exceptional circumstances, as permitted by law, Shaw may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without a Customer, Employee or Web Site User’s knowledge or consent.
In general, the use of products and services by a Customer, or a Web Site User, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, will constitute implied consent required by Shaw to collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
Consent may be withdrawn by Customers and Web Site Users at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and upon providing Shaw reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent to certain collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, please contact Shaw at privacy@shaw.ca.
