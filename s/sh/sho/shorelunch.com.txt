This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of what personal information is collected on our websites and how that information is maintained and used by Southeastern Mills, Inc. This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on www.betterthanbouillon.com and all websites, email or mobile applications owned and operated by Southeastern Mills, Inc.
At Southeastern Mills we want to provide you with the highest quality services. Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. We have posted this privacy policy to let you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information.
Personal Information We Collect. You don't need to provide any personal information to access our websites. However, Southeastern Mills provides you the opportunity to enhance your visit to our site by providing personal information to us for use for certain features, such as The Culinary Club, contests, and surveys. The information we collect may include, but is not limited to, name, contact information, the products you purchase, the types of recipes you are interested in receiving from us, and information about your cooking habits. We may on occasion collect personal information that you provide to third parties (such as information you provide in response to a Southeastern Mills advertisement that appears on another website). If we do collect personal information from third parties in such instances, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How We Use Your Personal Information. We may use the information you provide on our website to send you periodic e-mail updates about our company, send you newsletters and recipes, to send you surveys or to notify you of special offers and promotions. You may opt out of receiving these communications at any time by clicking on the opt-out link located in emails received. If you sign up to participate in surveys on our website, then we will use your contact information to send you such products or surveys. If you provide us with your mailing address, we may use this information to send you special offers or promotions by mail. If you do not want to receive special offers or promotions by mail, please do not provide your mailing address. We also may use or disclose your Personal Information when we, in our sole discretion, believe that such use or disclosure is necessary to comply with any law or public interest, or to enforce or protect our rights and ensure that the rights of other users are protected.
Collection and Use of Your Non-Personal Information. We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it: We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, cooking preferences, location, and the time zone so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising. We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the operating system you may be using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), a date/time stamp of when you visited our site, and click-stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze aggregate trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties. At times Southeastern Mills may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Southeastern Mills to provide products and services, or that help Southeastern Mills market to consumers. Personal information will only be shared by Southeastern Mills to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
