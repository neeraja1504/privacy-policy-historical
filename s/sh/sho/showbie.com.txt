Privacy – Showbie
The following is our Privacy Policy. It discusses the high degree of importance that we place on your privacy, including how we collect, use and disclose “Personal Information” as well as the rules and conditions related to privacy of information while using our service.
1. Our Privacy Pledge
Showbie Inc. (“ Showbie ”, “we” or “us”) provides certain services including our mobile application (the “ Application ”) and related software services as more particularly described in our Terms of Use (“ Services ”). We want you to know that your trust is key to the success of our business. We take privacy and confidentiality very seriously and we safeguard the personal information of our users in accordance with this Policy.
In this Policy Personal Information” means personal information about an identifiable individual and information which can be used to identify an individual.
Showbie complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information. Please refer to Addendum 1.1 of this policy for more information regarding EU Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Certification.
For residents of the European Economic Area, Showbie generally processes Personal Information in order to fulfill contracts we have with our customers and Users and to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Otherwise, Showbie will obtain consent from a Data Subject in respect of processing of Personal Information if required by law to do so.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control. Our customers are responsible for maintaining their own privacy policies governing the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information and are responsible for ensuring that they have obtained the necessary authorizations and consents for any Personal Information made available to us for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
2. Consent
By using our Services and supplying information to us, or by using the Showbie Application, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information by us for the purpose of providing Services to you via the Showbie Application, and administering your account in accordance with: (a) this Policy, (b) any other agreement you may have entered into with us, and (c) applicable laws and regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that we are kept informed of the correct and current contact information for you.
3. Single Sign-On
You are able to log in to our Services using certain specified third-party accounts such as Google. We may add other third-party sign-on functionality from time to time. By signing on in this way, you consent to the use of certain information to authenticate your identity, and you consent to share certain Personal Information with us (such as name, profile picture (if available) and email address) to pre-populate your profile. We safeguard this information the same way as any Personal Information collected by us through the Services, as outlined in this Policy.
Some third-party services give you the option to post or share information about your use of the services to your third-party account. The settings for that kind of sharing are outside of our Services. It’s up to you to check the sharing and privacy settings on your third-party account.
4. Collection of User Information
Showbie collects limited Personal Information from administrative personnel at the school board, educational institution, school,  teachers or other organization that  has contracted with Showbie, only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie and as needed for account administration, including communicating with users and designated third-party service providers as required for account administration.
5. Collection of Student Information
(a) Showbie collects limited Personal Information from minor students, only as needed for the operation and management of the services provided by Showbie, and only where that student’s school board, educational institution or teacher has contracted with Showbie to do so. In particular, Showbie collects names, usernames, and profile pictures. This profile information collected allows students to interact with other teachers, students and other users from their school or institution as more particularly described below.
(b) We first require the school board, educational institution or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such student Personal Information. If you are a minor student, do not upload or send any Personal Information about yourself or other students to Showbie, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. In the event that we discover we have the Personal Information of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us Personal Information without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at info@showbie.com.
(c) Students who have signed up with an access code provided by a school or teacher should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their Showbie account, including, but not limited to, messages between other students, teachers, and assignment grades.
(d) All students and teachers within a single course group in the password-protected portion of the Showbie site have the ability to view one another’s profiles, but visibility is limited to such information as their names, photographs and biographies. Students are unable to see the grades of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on the site.
(e) The Showbie site allows students and teachers to interact, post information, assignments, grades and other similar information. This information will also form part of the Personal Information of students. However, Showbie acts as a Data Processor (as that term is defined below) of this Personal Information on behalf of the students’ school board, educational institution or teacher who has contracted with Showbie, and that school board, educational institution or teacher acts as the Data Controller (as that term is defined below) of that information.

We may collect, aggregate and anonymize data for system monitoring, quality control, marketing and product improvement purposes, provided it does not collect, use or disclose any Personal Information of users. In some cases, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information of administrative users or teachers for targeted marketing purposes provided it does not direct advertising to any student users, and provided that student Personal Information is not used or disclosed. In some cases, we may share Personal Information with our designated third-party service providers as required for account administration or otherwise in connection with providing the Services. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
