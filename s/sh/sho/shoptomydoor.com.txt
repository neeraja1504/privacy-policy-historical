Credit/ATM Card Security
The security of your personal information is extremely important to us. We strive to always protect your online transactions, and use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We recommend you use a browser that supports SSL, so that, your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet. SSL works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, and Apple's Safari's browser. This ensures that only Aascargo.com can read your personal information. SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet.
We have taken security a step further by using Comodos Extended Validation (EV) SSL technology. This is the most trusted form of SSL. Most newer brousers made for EV SSL, including IE 7 and above, Firefox 3, Opera 9.5. will automatically tell you if a site is secured by the presence of a green bar near the address. EV SSL is the most difficult form of SSL to purchase as it requires total verification of the company and their operations to ensure it is issued to a legitimate company. It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.All user information we collect on this site is collected through secure web pages, and some data is in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduces the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Our EV logo, basically says it all.
