Collection of Personal Information
The only personal information collected by Shop Get Organized through our web sites is information that is submitted to us voluntarily and knowingly by site visitors. When you simply browse our site, no personal information is being collected by Shop Get Organized. Our company does collect web site usage information internally to improve the products and services we provide to you. Web site usage information is not personally identifiable information. It describes how our web site is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stay. Web site usage information also includes the domain names of browsers who visit our web site, time of day the web site was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information.
Some functions and services offered through our site require that you provide certain personal information. Personal information includes name, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, and other information that might personally identify you. When you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list, we may need your postal or e-mail address.
Receiving Information from Shop Get Organized
When you order online, Shop Get Organized will send you information regarding the status of your order via e-mail. Also it is necessary for you to provide us your phone number when you order a product. We need this to contact you in case we have a question or comment about your order information.
When you voluntarily provide us with personal information, such as when you register or place an order, you will see a notice that states unless you opt-out of receiving communications from Shop Get Organized, you will receive additional information from Shop Get Organized. This information includes e-mails or other communication about new products and services available from Shop Get Organized that we believe will be of interest to you. Should you later choose not to receive such communications from Shop Get Organized, we reserve the right to contact you via e-mail regarding information as it relates to your order only.
The personal information you have provided us, and information about your order, may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. To learn more about one of our marketing partners, please click www.plazadirect.com. If you prefer we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please write to us at the address above, or e-mail customerservice@shopgetorganized.com
If you agreed to receive e-mail from our marketing partners, we will share with them your e-mail address and the information described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. We will only share your e-mail address if you have opted in by checking the box on the registration page. Additionally, each e-mail our partners send you will include a description of the simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mail.
Receiving Third Party Information
One of the many services our company can offer to you when you register or purchase is to notify you by e-mail or other means of communication about new products and services available from trusted third party marketing partners. These notices and offers will be targeted to your individual preferences and tastes. You will not receive these offers from third parties unless you opt-in to do so during registration. Opt-in means you have checked the box that states, "Yes, send me offers from other third party marketing partners targeted to your individual preferences." Once you have opted-in, you can always change your mind and prevent the sending of such communications since each e-mail will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future third party e-mails.
