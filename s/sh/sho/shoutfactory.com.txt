Even when we do not retain certain Personal Information, it may be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process such Personal Information. Some examples of Personal Information we collect are:

Automatic/Anonymous Data
Some of the above data is collected and logged by us automatically and anonymously (“Anonymous Information”), in order to make a Shout Site and the Shout Service more useful to you. Here are some other examples of Anonymous Information we collect which is not directly provided by you:
(1) Data Collected by Shout Servers: Shout’s servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (every device has a unique number, or IP Address, that is automatically assigned to your device when you use the Internet, which may change between sessions of use), your domain name, the date and time stamp of your visit, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, and clickstream data. We use this information to recognize and analyze trends, administer Shout Services, track our users’ movement throughout Shout Services, compile demographic information about our overall user base, and adapt Shout Services to our users’ needs.
(2) Cookies, web beacons, and advertising identifiers: Like most sites, Shout’s Services may use what are known as “cookies” in certain instances, or similar technology such as web beacons, and advertising identifiers, which may use small text files to store a randomly assigned ID and a website reference ID to make your device recognizable to Shout. This technology is generally not used to store Personal Information. Cookies and other similar technology, as they now exist or develop, are used by Shout to help remind us of our users’ identities and tailor Shout Services to reflect our users’ personal interests, estimate our audience size, process user orders, facilitate and track user involvement in any of our contests, sweepstakes and other promotions, and analyze the visiting patterns of our users.
(3) Device Information: If you use a Shout Service via a computer, phone, tablet or any other electronic device application or “App”, Shout may choose to collect Personal Information about the device you use to access the App, including your device’s hardware model, the name and version of your operating system, your MAC address, the unique ID of your device, and what mobile network you are using. Please note that Shout has no control over what Personal Information your device’s platform operator, such as Apple and Google, collects and uses. We suggest in addition to this document, you review your platform operator’s privacy policies to gain a better understanding of their own standards and practices regarding Personal Information.
(4) Advertiser Collected Data: Shout may use third-party websites and advertising networks and companies including, without limitation, social media sites including Facebook (“Ad Companies”) to display ads for or on Shout Services. Shout collects information from these advertising services as set forth herein and the privacy policies of such Ad Companies. Such information may include but not be limited to: your use of a Shout Service, your IP address, your ISP, as well as the browser you used to visit a Shout Site or the device you used to engage with a Shout Service. The Ad Companies and third-party websites use cookies and other technology to track data about you, both on and off of the Shout Sites. The information is collected by Shout for analysis and visiting patterns, and may also be used, should a visitor to a Shout Site become a user, to deliver targeted advertising based on your interests. Shout is not responsible for the Ad Companies’ or other third-party sites’ collection, protection or use of your Personal Information. We suggest that, prior to using such third-party sites, you review their privacy policies to learn about their use of your information, as well as their implementation of cookies and similar technologies. If you would like more information about the practice of placing cookies on your device and to learn more about your choices regarding not having this information used by Shout or any other third-party companies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Note Regarding Statistical Data/Sensitive Data

All such information will be collected anonymously by Shout for marketing demographic knowledge only. At no point will Shout ask for or process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, data relating to criminal convictions or data concerning a user’s sex life or sexual orientation.

How We Disclose Personal Information
Personal Information as supplied by you to Shout will not be disclosed outside of Shout except as described below and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. All of the below Affiliates and third-party partners are contractually obligated to follow at all times the current and applicable practices of data protection as set forth by the law and maintain the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy.
(1) Third-party Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with our third-party service providers that help us provide a Shout Service we offer, such as third-party websites that offer a Shout Service as part of a “bundling” within their own services and third-party companies that help us process payments for goods and services. Please note that while a Shout Service may be made available for purchase/subscription via third-party websites and the information you provide to them in order to make such transactions will be made available to them (as well as Shout) for the purposes of facilitating such transaction, any third-party websites are party to their own rules and regulations regarding acquisition, usage and protection of personal information. Please visit that third-party site’s privacy policy for more information.
(2) Third Party Tracking Services: Shout allows third-party tracking services such as Google Analytics to monitor Shout Sites and Shout Services which may involve the collection of Personal Information. If such Personal Information is tracked by third-party services, the information will be anonymous and for statistical and analytics purposes only unless further agreed upon by you. See our Advertiser Collected Data section above.
(3) Affiliates: Since most of our functions requiring Personal Information (including marketing and technical support) are handled in-house throughout various departments in our company, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“Affiliates”) in order to best operate the Shout Sites and Shout Services and cater and market them to you according to your interests and feedback. If we acquire additional Affiliates in the future, we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

If any of the above were to occur, and our company, business and/or assets are acquired by a third party, such third party will assume all right and responsibility to your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
(5) Necessary Disclosures. Please be advised that, regardless of the choices you make regarding your Personal Information, Shout may be required to disclose such Personal Information as necessary to comply with any current or future state, federal or international laws and regulations, to cooperate with a legal investigation(s), subpoena(s) or warrants served on Shout, to defend our rights, property (including copyright) or our users (including you) and to investigate or assist in preventing any violation of the state, federal or international law (potential or actual), Shout’s Privacy Policy, or Shout’s Terms of Use.
Note Regarding Social Networking
Shout does not share your Personal Information with any social networking service or “SNS” (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). You may voluntarily contribute information, feedback and commentary to an SNS. However, if you choose to share information or post content to these sites regarding a Shout Site or a Shout Service, you are solely responsible for your use of those websites. It will be your responsibility to follow the terms of use of such third-party website and review their privacy policy. We cannot and will not in any way be responsible for any activity that occurs on such SNS, including your own activity or use of such website.
Note Regarding Links To Third-Party Sites
Further to the SNS note above, a Shout Site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties. In addition, such third-party sites may reference, advertise, or link to a Shout Site. Shout has no control over these third-party web sites. Privacy policies on such linked sites may be different from our Privacy Policy. Shout does not endorse or sponsor other web sites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-Shout Sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such web sites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other sites and advertisement.

Editing, Correcting And Deleting Personal Information
You can request access to your Personal Information, or correct inaccurate Personal Information by contacting info@shoutfactory.com
Shout will keep your Personal Information for as long as you use a Shout Service or visit a Shout Site and for an amount of time after you have stopped using the Shout Service or visiting a Shout Site for administrative and analysis purposes only.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, Shout may keep an anonymized form of your Personal Information for a longer period, but such data cannot in any way be connected to you.

To opt out of interest-based ads from Shout in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under “privacy” or “ads” in your device’s settings). Note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you that are not interest-based.
(4) Additional Choices for California Residents. We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you (as compared to when the third party is acting on our behalf or you have provided your personal information as part of a co-promotion by Shout and the third party) unless you first agree to such disclosure. If you are a California resident, you may be entitled to request certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of Personal Information (such as your name and contact information) to third parties who wish to contact you or send you promotional information about their products and services directly.

Protecting Children
Shout Services as well as Shout Sites are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at info@shoutfactory.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children’s online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children’s access to the web.
Security
We use commercially reasonable encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from a Shout Site, and you do so at your own risk. We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft. Should Shout experience a data breach involving your Personal Information, we will notify you of such breach (to the best of our ability based on your communication preferences).
Personal Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Except as specifically set forth herein, we will never sell your Personal Information to any third-party under any circumstances without warning you in advance, changing this Privacy Policy, and giving you the option to approve or deny such settings.

Governing Law; Resolution Of Disputes By Binding Arbitration
This Privacy Policy and all disputes arising hereunder or relating hereto or with respect to any Shout Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles. You and we agree that all questions, disputes, controversies or claims between us shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Federal Arbitration Act. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL. This agreement to arbitrate applies to, but is not limited to, all disputes regarding the construction or application of this Agreement, all claims arising under federal, state, or local statutory or common law, including, without limitation, claims of breach of promise[s], breach of contract or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tort claims, sexual harassment claims and any and all other claims of illegality or breach of any right which you might hold against us, under this Agreement or otherwise.
The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its rules and procedures. The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California before a single neutral arbitrator from the panel of AAA. The Rules of Evidence of the State of California, including the rules relating to hearsay, will apply to the arbitration. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision and award including the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The opinion and award will decide all issues submitted and shall be final and binding to the fullest extent permitted by law and will be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction. To the extent allowed by California law, the arbitrator shall be required to follow all applicable substantive law. The arbitrator shall grant any legally meritorious motion for summary judgment presented by any party. The prevailing party shall have its arbitration fees, attorneys’ fees, expert fees, consulting fees, and all other associated and related costs paid for by the other party and the arbitrator’s opinion and order shall so state. The arbitrator shall be permitted to award those remedies, in law or equity, which are requested by the parties and which the arbitrator determines to be supported by credible and relevant evidence presented. The party who prevails in any arbitration may seek to have the arbitrator’s award confirmed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be private and confidential. As a material inducement to Shout to provide the Shout Services to you, you hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the right to institute, prosecute or join any class action case against Shout, even if the rules of the AAA would otherwise allow for such. Accordingly, the arbitrator may award money or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. No class or representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this agreement. Any question regarding the enforceability or interpretation of this paragraph shall be decided by a court and not the arbitrator.

The new policy will apply to all current and past users of the Shout Sites and Shout Services and will replace any prior policies which are inconsistent.

Additionally, you will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Shout Site, of any information about you contained in the applicable Shout database, if Shout or one of its companies assigns its rights and obligations regarding any of your information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Shout ‘s or such Shout company’s assets related to the applicable site or service to a subsequent owner or operator.
