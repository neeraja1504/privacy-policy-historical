Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies
We use "cookies" and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this site. For example, we use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use our site – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. Cookies and other Web technologies are also used to support the features and functionality of our site — for example, to track the contents of your shopping cart as you move from page to page. These technologies also permit us to keep a record of your previous choices and preferences so that we can personalize your shopping experience and save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database. Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally, however, it may be linked to information that does identify you personally, such as the information you provide when you make a purchase or register to use a special feature of this site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave EVINE.com. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit EVINE.com, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this site.
Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may supplement the information collected through this site with information we collect in other ways. For example, if you call our toll-free number, we may collect your telephone number and add it to our database. We may also supplement the information collected through this site with information from third parties, including data brokers. By supplementing your profile with information from other sources, we are better able to provide product recommendations and special offers that will be of genuine interest to you. We may also use this additional information to further personalize our site and improve your shopping experience.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Advertising Agents
Evine uses third-party advertising companies to place online advertisements on our behalf at websites other than EVINE.com. These advertising companies may use cookies and Web beacons (also known as "pixel tags") to target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements. For example, our advertising companies may place Web beacons on their clients' websites. When you visit these websites, the Web beacon "tags" your computer with a "cookie" that collects and stores information about your visit to their client's websites. This information does not identify you personally. Our advertising companies use the information they collect about your use of their clients' Web sites to customize the advertisements you see when you visit their clients' websites. Our advertising companies' use of cookies and Web beacons is covered by their privacy policies, not by this Online Privacy Statement.
