Google Adwords Conversion Tracking
Shoppingscanner applies Google Conversion Tracking. In this context, Google places a cookie on your computer if you reach this website via a Google ad. These cookies expire after 30 days and do not serve any personal identification. If a user visits certain pages of the website of an adword client and if the cookie has not expired, Google and the client can verify that the user has clicked on the ad and was directed to this website. Each adword client receives a different cookie. Cookies therefore can not be traced back via the websites of adword clients. The information collected by means of the conversion cookie serves the purpose to create conversion statistics for adword clients that have taken a decision towards conversion tracking. Adword clients receive the overall number of users who have clicked on their ad and haven been directed to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that allows the personal identification of users. If you do not wish to take part in the tracking procedure, you may decline the required placement of a cookie – for instance with a browser setting that generally deactivates the placement of cookies. You also can deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by chosing a browser setting that blocks cookies of the domain „www.googleadservices.com“. Here, you can find Google’s data protection policy on conversion tracking.
