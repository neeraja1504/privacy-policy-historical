privacy - ShootQ
ShootQ Inc (“ShootQ”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By opening a photographer account on ShootQ’s website at https://shootq.com/ (“shootq.com”), or using any of our services or products, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers ShootQ’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) ShootQ gathers when you are accessing shootq.com and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ShootQ does not own or control, or to individuals ShootQ does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information Does ShootQ display or Collect?
The information we gather from users varies based on whether they are either an end user or a Photographer. Photographers are users who use shootq.com to organize and gain clients using shootq.com. This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect from each Photographer. End Users are users who have hired (or may hire) a Photographer for their occasion. The information we collect from End Users is governed by the End User Privacy Policy.
The information we collect enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other Photographers and End Users through shootq.com. In connection with shootq.com, we may request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of shootq.com, which allows Photographers and End Users to identify, interact, and contract with each other. We collect the following types of information from our users:
Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you enter on shootq.com or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, gender, e-mail address, cell phone number, occupation, hometown, college, personal interests, and information about your use of the services on shootq.com. You may also store your availability information, rates, previous experience, and other information related to your business on ShootQ. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, communicating with you about specials and new features, improving our services, and connecting Photographers with End Users. You may modify or remove your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.
Personal Information Collected Automatically:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with shootq.com or obtain services from us. ShootQ automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, ShootQ cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your transactions on shootq.com.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. ShootQ only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of shootq.com or services so that we can make shootq.com appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and shootq.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, ShootQ never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
E-mail Communications:
We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from ShootQ if your computer supports this type of program. ShootQ uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of shootq.com’s most attractive features.
Ads appearing on shootq.com may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
