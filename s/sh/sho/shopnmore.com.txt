What is a Cookie?
You must allow cookies and pop-up windows to be active on your system to participate in our programs. Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. Our site utilizes cookies to collect information about how our site is used. Passive Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the site pages viewed, time spent at our site, the sites visited just before and just after our site. If you do not wish to transmit "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult the "Help" section of your browser to correctly do so. Our site's servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Your IP address may be used to address problems with our server or administer our site or to gather broad demographic information about our members.
How Do We Use the Information Collected?
Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use Active Information for purposes of contacting you regarding the information you have requested. We use Passive Information to gather information about our members and to enhance and design our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use. Additionally, cookies help us know information about how many people visit our site, when they visit and how they use our service. Passive Information may result in your viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits for your viewing on our site and a shopping experience customized to you in content, services and goods.
Sharing Information in Other Scenarios
We may be required by subpoena, law or government agency to disclose both Active and Passive Information you have provided to us. Should we buy or sell assets of our company, another company may need to review our company's assets, including your information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such assets. The parties who perform services for us (credit card processors, merchant bank, our Internet Service Provider) may also have access to your information in performing such services.
How Do We Secure Active Information and Passive Information?
We secure your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable technical efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of Active Information and Passive Information. Efforts we may take to ensure the security include but are not limited to: maintaining our own servers under our private control, data encryption and/or monitoring of our network and data for intrusions. Communications you may have with us via email or snail mail may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your sending information. Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive information through these means.
How Can You Choose Not to Receive Information About Products or Services By Us or to Correct, Delete or Access Your Information?
If you desire not to receive information about products or services we think may be of interest to you or if you wish to access, delete or correct your information, please contact us at Attn: Shopnmore, Media Spade, Inc., 110 Prominence Point Pkwy, Suite 114-165, Canton, GA, 30114
