2. Technology Used to Collect Data. We use the following technologies to collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data in connection with your use of the Site and the Services: cookies, tracking pixels, IP addresses (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and our browser plug-in. " Cookies " are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Cookies can be disabled or removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our Site may not work properly. " Tracking pixel " is a small transparent graphic image (usually only 1 pixel) that we (or third parties) place on our Site, on Retailer sites, or in e-mails we send you, that is used to collect information about the pages you view and when you view them. We use these technologies to collect information about your use of the Services, times of your visits to our Site and Retailer sites, the products that you searched, viewed, purchased, and shipped, your browser type, operating system, IP address, domain name, as well as other information described in this Privacy Policy.
3. Information Collected via Retailer Sites. ShopRunner Retailers include our tracking pixels on their sites to allow us to collect the following information (1) how many people in aggregate click on any of our ShopRunner links or graphics, and (2) order information on the order confirmation page, including order ID number, product codes, shipping method, and products eligible for ShopRunner benefits. Notwithstanding any restriction in the Retailer's privacy policy, you hereby consent to this collection of information via our Retailers' sites.
4. Information Collected on other sites. Other websites may allow ShopRunner, including via advertising companies and ad networks, to display advertisements on their websites. We may use technologies such as cookies and tracking pixels, to collect information about users who view or interact with our advertisements. We may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements we deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. We also may combine this information with Personal Data we have already collected from you. This information allows us to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).
5. Information Collected by Third Party Websites. Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as our Retailer websites, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.

ShopRunner reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion.

We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, " Affiliates "), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

You may opt-out of our disclosure of your Personal Data to Third Party Companies for their marketing purposes as described in Section 8 below. The privacy policies of each Third Party Company govern the use and disclosure of your Personal Data by such Third Party Company.

They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third party's privacy policy.
