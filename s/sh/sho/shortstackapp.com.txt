Transmission and Storage of Data
Pancake Laboratories, Inc respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, employees, consumers, business partners and others. The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks are the agreed upon systems between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Swiss Administration for handling transatlantic data flows. Included in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields are vigorous standards that must be met by companies handling Europeans’ personal data, along with tough enforcement of these standards. U.S. companies, such as Pancake, importing personal data from European countries are required to commit to robust obligations on how personal data is processed and individual rights are guaranteed. Pancake pledges its commitment to meeting the standards put in place by the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields. Companies who publish their commitments to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields will be under the scrutiny of the Department of Commerce, as the act of publishing a commitment makes it enforceable under U.S. law by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, any company handling human resources data from Europe has to commit to comply with decisions by European DPAs.
Under the GDPR, you (the ShortStack customer) are considered a Data Controller, while ShortStack is the Data Processor. ShortStack’s EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields’ certification and a completed and signed DPA will allow you, the Data Controller, to legally transfer personal data you collect via ShortStack from within the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. (where ShortStack’s servers are located). To stay compliant with the GDPR, you should download, review, complete and sign our DPA, then send it back to us at contact@shortstacklab.com.
