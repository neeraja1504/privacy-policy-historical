Personal Data includes personally identifiable information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you personally, including, name, physical address, telephone number, email address, and content you post on our Websites. It can also include transaction information, such as credit card information and other details about purchases you make online or through the mail. Generally, you may use our Sites and Services without providing any Personal Data. However, we may ask you to provide Personal Data at various times and places, such as when you purchase something from us, register on a website, subscribe to a newsletter, or request to receive a message from us (for example, requesting an answer to a Prayer Request).  We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the information requested, you may not be able to access all areas of Site or Service, or take advantage of all of the features. We may combine the demographic information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. If you submit any Personal Data relating to other people through the Sites and Services (for example, through our Pray for Others feature), you represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Log Data : When you visit the Websites or Domains, our web servers automatically collect anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate the Websites or Domains, which includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, as well as the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to your visit to our Websites or Domains , and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology is available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page.
IP Addresses : An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. It is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university, though it may also provide information concerning your general geographical location. When visitors request pages from our Websites, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Website.
Device ID : A device ID is a unique number permanently associated with your mobile or other device, such as an iPhone or Android mobile phone.  If you visit one of our Websites or use one of our Domains using a mobile device, we may take note of your device ID and use your device ID to identify you or recognize you if you return, for certain internal purposes such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Websites or use of the Domains.
Cookies : Cookies are information files that our Websites may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. We use cookies and website analytics tools from third parties such as Google, Facebook, Mouseflow and Addshoppers to collect and receive information, including anonymized IP address, location (city/country), pages visited and content, time on site, browser, operating system, device type (desktop/tablet/phone) and similar metadata.  Advertisers or other third parties that are serving content on some of our pages may set and access their own cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by third parties. Such third parties’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this one. Such third parties do not have access to our cookies.
You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Websites will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser’s provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.
Web Beacons : While you are on our Websites or otherwise viewing our content, such as in a newsletter or e-mail, or are on the website of one of our trusted third party marketing partners, you may encounter Web beacons which may come from Guideposts or from third parties, such as advertisers or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a Web bug or “clear gif,” is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and may allow access to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Guideposts does not have control over Web beacons used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect. Guideposts may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many of our electronic newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) were actually opened. We may also use Web beacons on our Websites or the websites of our trusted marketing partners to allow us to show you offers that we think you will like and to avoid showing you offers that you have already seen, in order to improve your overall experience.
We and our trusted third party marketing partners may share with one another anonymous versions of user information (i.e., aggregate data or data which does not identify a particular individual). We may use that information to link to and issue anonymous cookies containing demographic or intent-based data for online behavioral advertising purposes.  Such cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.  If you would like to opt out of online behavioral advertising, click on one of these links and follow the instructions found on those sites: http://www.aboutads.info/choices  or  http://networkadvertising.org/choices.

If, at any point, you do not wish to receive information about all or some of our programs, products, features or services, you can remove yourself from the mailing list for newsletters and promotional materials by sending an e-mail message to:  GPSprod@cdsfulfillment.com  or by mailing your request to us at the following address: PO Box 5815 Harlan, IA 51593-1315. To opt out of email correspondence, you can also click on the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email. If you do not opt-out, Guideposts may share your Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes.
Please bear in mind that this opt-out choice for “third parties” will not apply to Guideposts licensees and co-branding participants, as set forth below. Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from us, or (b) Guideposts uses your Personal Data for either operational purposes (e.g., to complete transactions requested by you, such as your purchase of a product or service, or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Sites and Services, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy) or fulfillment purposes (e.g., sharing with companies that facilitate communications and transactions with you).
Finally, it may take 30 to 90 days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using Personal Data shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your Personal Data might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for up to 90 days after you make your request.  For similar reasons, if your Personal Data is shared with a third party, Guideposts generally loses control over how that information is used. Thus, even after you have opted-out of allowing us to share your Personal Data, you might continue to receive promotional materials from third parties unless and until you duly register your opt-out request with each third party in question.
