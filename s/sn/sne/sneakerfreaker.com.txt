Information About All Sneaker Freaker International Users and Visitors
Our site automatically gathers certain usage information, such as the number of visitors and the frequency of visits to sneakerfreaker.com. We only use such data in the aggregate. This data helps us to determine how much our users use specific parts of the site. It helps us improve our site and ensure that it is as appealing as possible to as many as possible. For example, Sneaker Freaker International uses "cookies" that tell us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are. We may provide Sneaker Freaker International partners with statistical information about how our users collectively use our internet sites, but this never contains any personal information about you. We do this so partners too can understand the degree to which users are interacting with and using certain areas of our site, in order to provide you with the best possible Web experience. Finally, sneakerfreaker.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to determine – on an anonymous basis – which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users have responded to them. These technologies are not used to collect personally identifiable information unless you have given us permission to do so.
