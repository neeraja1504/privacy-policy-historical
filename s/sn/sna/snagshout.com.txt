Snagshout.com ("Snagshout", "we," "us" or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Snagshout.com website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") (we refer to the Site and the services made available through the Site, collectively, as "Snagshout Features"). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Snagshout Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and Snagshout Features. By visiting the Site or using any of the Snagshout Features, you consent to Snagshout's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.
This policy answers the following questions:
What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
Will we share your personal information with third parties?
What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?
What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?
1. What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
Types of Information We Collect
Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the Snagshout Features.
We collect personal information when you participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the Snagshout Features; or receive customer or technical support.
We collect information from you such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number when utilizing the Site and Snagshout Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products.
How We Use Your Personal Information
The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill any product or service orders; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We also use your email address and phone number as part of the Snagshout Features in sending you messages about the Snagshout Features and other general announcements.
We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Snagshout Features. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Snagshout Features. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.
We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Snagshout Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information.
You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Snagshout Features (the Analytical Data). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Snagshout Features users.

To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective web-masters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.

3. What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?
Control of your information
You may change or delete any information you've shared with use by sending us an email. We do keep records of past purchases and periodically back up information, so it may not be possible for you to delete all information we have stored, and we may retain certain information to prevent fraud and for customer and order management purposes.

All Snagshout personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any of the Snagshout Features and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
