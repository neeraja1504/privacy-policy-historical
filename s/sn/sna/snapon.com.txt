Passive Information Collection
The Web site may "passively" collect certain kinds of information during your visit, including but not limited to:

However, in any situation where you log in with your username and password, any or all of the information that is passively collected about your activities on the Web site may be linked with your identity, and therefore may become Personal Information about you.
The Purposes for Which We Use and Disclose Personal Information
We use and disclose Personal Information obtained when you place an order or access this Web site to process and complete that order, and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.
We maintain certain Personal Data related to financial payments, such as credit/debit card/procurement card information, only until payment for your order is processed, unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may contact us at eorders@snapon.com and ask us to delete such information.
We also use Personal Information to communicate with you, for example, to answer the e-mail and correspondence we receive, to confirm your order, to send more information about becoming a dealer, to send renewal notices, and to notify you of important changes in the functionality of the Web site or other notices related to the handling of your Personal Information.
We may use Personal Information to make recommendations for additional products or special offers, and to provide you with updates on new products that we believe may be of interest to you, in situations where you expressly request such communications. If you have previously asked to receive this information, but do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us at eorders@snapon.com.
From time to time, we may share certain Personal Information with select third parties including other Snap-on affiliates and independent Snap-on dealers in your area to enable them to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share such Personal Information in the future, please contact us at eorders@snapon.com and we will take reasonable measures to avoid sharing such information in the future. Please note that such third parties are usually independent from Snap-on, and if you wish to stop all communications from such parties, you will need to address such issues with the third parties directly.
We may disclose Personal Information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information to protect the security of the Web site, to protect ourselves and our affiliated companies against liability, and/or in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business.
We may share Personal Information with our consultants or service providers to help us serve you better. We also contract other companies and individuals (collectively "Suppliers") to perform functions on our behalf, including without limitation, fulfilling and processing orders, processing credit card payments, handling shipping and returns, sending communications to you, and providing customer services. We require the Suppliers to agree to abide by Snap-on's privacy policy and only use your Personal Information, including certain Personal Data related to financial payments, such as credit/debit card/procurement card information, only until payment for your order is processed, and only to the extent necessary to perform their functions, and may not use it for any other purpose.

Customization and Aggregate data
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and gather information for product management and development at Snap-on. For example, we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This aggregate information may also be shared with Snap-on's affiliates and independent dealers.
Our Commitment to Data Security
We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect Personal Information. When you place orders or access your account information, we usually offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the Personal Information you input before it is sent to us and seeks to prevent anyone else from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours. If you are still concerned about placing an order online, please feel free to call a customer service representative at 1-877-762-7664 and place your order via phone.
Children's Privacy
