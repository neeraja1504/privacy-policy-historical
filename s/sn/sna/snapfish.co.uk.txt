At Snapfish, we help you bring your photos to life. If you are a new snapper or a professional photographer, a proud parent or imaginable teenager, a passionate pet owner or an avid outdoor enthusiast, your privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Notice explains what information Snapfish, LLC (“Snapfish,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, retains, and protects, and the choices you have. This Privacy Notice applies only to the websites, online services, and mobile applications (collectively the “Services”) where this Privacy Notice is posted. Your use of the Services is also subject to our Terms of Use.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Notice AND THE TERMS OF USE in full to understand our privacy practices before using our WEBSITE, products, and services. BY USING OUR WEBSITE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS Privacy Notice.
What Kind of Information does Snapfish Collect and Why?
We want to help you tell your story of the people, places, and memories you cherish. We are dedicated to helping you turn your photos into beautiful, personal décor, photo books, mugs, prints, gifts, and more that you’ll be proud to share and can treasure for years to come. When you use Snapfish products and services, we collect certain information about you and your online habits. The type of information we collect depends on the type of products and services you use. For example:
Information about You and Your Snapfish Account: When you want to upload digital photos or view others’ photos on the Services, you may provide us with: ****
Your first and last name
Your email address
A password
This information is mandatory to create and use your Snapfish account so that you can maintain all of your digital photos and other Snapfish activities in one place. We use your information to help verify your identity, account, and account activities to ensure the safety and security of your transactions.
If you choose to purchase our products and/or use our services, we will collect and analyze your information and information about your use of our products and services to develop and improve our products and services.

Information about Your Invitees: An “Invitee” is defined as anyone (i.e., your friends, family, colleagues) who is invited to the Services to see an album. There are four ways in which you can share your photos with Invitees: ****
By email. We will ask for email addresses of your Invitees. The email address is mandatory to share your Snapfish photos with Invitees on our Services via email. However, the Invitee will need to have an account to view the shared album(s).
On our mobile app. If you want to share your photos with Invitees via your mobile phone using SMS/text, we will ask for mobile phone numbers of your Invitees. If you select this option, you will need to enter a phone number of an Invitee from your mobile phone contact list, select the photo(s) you want to share, and send these photos to the selected Invitee. When you choose to share your photo(s) using SMS/text, the Invitee gets a text with the photo you shared; they will not see the album.
With a link. You can also share your photo(s) and/or album(s) via a link, but please note that anyone with this link will be able to view your photo(s) and/or album(s).
Through Facebook. You can also share your photo(s) and/or album(s) through Facebook, but please note that anyone with access to your Facebook post will be able to view your photo(s) and/or album(s).
If you share your photos/albums using our website, your Invites will see only photos and/or albums you shared with them, your name and contact information; they will not see your other photos and albums.
Before providing us with email addresses and mobile phone numbers of your Invitee, please ensure you have the Invitee’s consent or your relationship is such that the Invitee would consent to receiving the email or being contacted by phone.
