Privacy Policy | Snap Surveys
This privacy policy is effective as of 25 May 2018. The previous version of this privacy policy is available here.
Snap Surveys Limited and Snap Surveys NH, Inc. (“Snap Surveys”, or “we” or “us”) are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. Our privacy policy describes how we capture and use the personal information that we gather about visitors to this website and users of our products and services. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.
Snap Surveys provides products and services which enable our customers to create and administer surveys. We may host our customers’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys on their behalf. Our customers may also upload contact information of potential survey respondents to invite them to participate in a survey. We refer to this contact information and responses as “Survey Data”. Our customers remain data controllers of this Survey Data and we process it solely in accordance with our agreement with our customers (for example, our Software License and Services Agreement).
Snap Surveys acts as data controller in relation to all personal information other than Survey Data. If you are a survey respondent, the data controller of the Survey Data is our customer who invited you to participate in the survey. For all other information, your data controller is Snap Surveys Limited if you are located outside of North or South America, and Snap Surveys NH, Inc. if you are located within North or South America.
If you have any questions, comments or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at one of the following addresses:

In the majority of cases, you should contact our customer if you have any questions about their survey, or to exercise your rights in relation to the Survey Data.
We provide our customers with a range of options as to where their Survey Data will be hosted, so please contact them for details for that survey.
We collect very limited information about you ourselves (as described in our full policy below) and we are the data controller of this information. We will only use it for limited purposes including protecting the security of our services and to respond to you if you contact us directly. We will not use your contact information for marketing.
We apply high standards of security to all information that we hold, in line with our ISO 27001:2013 certification, which provides independent confirmation that our information security policies and procedures follow industry best practice.

2. How we use your information
We use the information that we hold about you in the following ways. For each of these, we have identified our legal basis for processing your information in that way.
This section does not relate to your Survey Data – we process this only in accordance with your instructions and our agreement with you.
Providing our products and services: we use your information to provide you with the products and services which you have subscribed to or requested.

Third party services: where you choose to enable or connect to a third party application or service we use the information provided about you by that application or service to enable it to work in conjunction with our products or services.
To protect our business, products, services and website: we will use your information in accordance with our legitimate interests of administering and maintaining our systems and ensuring network and information security, for example to prevent unauthorised access to our networks, to investigate faults, to control the abuse of our products or services, to prevent denial of service attacks and to monitor system usage and server load.

where we require the information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services that you have requested);
where we have your consent to do so, and in this case you have the right to withdraw or refuse to give your consent at any time. This will not however affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before you withdraw it;

Privacy policy if you are a survey respondent
Introduction
Snap Surveys’ products and services enable our customers to create and administer surveys. We may host our customers’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys on their behalf. Our customers may also upload contact information of potential survey respondents to invite them to participate in a survey. We refer to this contact information and responses as “ Survey Data ”. Our customers remain data controllers of this Survey Data and we process it solely in accordance with our agreement with our customers. Aside from Survey Data, we are likely to process very limited information about you.
Our customers have total discretion to determine what information they collect, who they invite to participate in a survey, whether they upload respondent information, what the Survey Data will be used for, whether it will be combined with other information and data, who it will be shared with and how long it will be stored. We strongly recommend you read the privacy notices and/or obtain privacy information from our customer who has invited you to participate in the survey to fully understand how your Survey Data will be used.
We offer our customers a range of options as to how they host their surveys, including on servers managed by us in the UK or the US. Our customers may also install our products on their own servers in which case the survey is hosted by our customer and we do not process any Survey Data relating to that survey. The rest of this policy applies only where we host surveys on behalf of our customers or otherwise process Survey Data for them (for example, where we carry out paper surveys for them).

Cookies – to prevent multiple survey completion: if our customer has enabled this feature, Snap WebHost will use a cookie to prevent you completing the same survey multiple times.

We will not use any information that we hold about you for marketing purposes.
3. Who we share your information with
Survey Data: unless we are required to do so by law, we will not disclose your Survey Data to any third parties other than our customers and our subprocessors (such as our affiliates and our hosting providers) that have been authorised by our customer in our agreement with them.

Aside from Survey Data we are likely to hold only very limited information about you.
