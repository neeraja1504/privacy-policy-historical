1. INTRODUCTION
FOX Broadcasting Company ("FOX" or "we") operates FOX.com and other FOX show and entertainment websites that are operated by FOX (collectively, the "FOX Website" or "Site"). The services FOX offers include the FOX Websites, applications (in connection with the Site or third party services), community pages and any other features, content, promotions, games or applications offered from time to time by FOX including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the "FOX Services"). FOX is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.
As set forth in our Terms of Use, the FOX Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including both those who use a FOX Service without being registered with FOX or subscribing to a FOX Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to any FOX Service. This Privacy Policy describes FOX's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the FOX Services. We also provide information on the FOX Privacy Settings and describe generally FOX's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.
2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE FOX SERVICES
User Submitted Information
Account Information is the information that users provide to FOX when they register for or subscribe to a FOX Service, for example, to create an account or profile, enter a contest or sweepstakes, receive a newsletter, play a game or take a survey. This information may include, for example, name, display name, email address, gender, location, and date of birth. If you create a profile in connection with any of the FOX Services, your profile information may also be publicly available to anyone, unless the FOX Service for which you create the profile provides Privacy Settings to allow you to control the parties with whom you share that content.
Public Information and Posts consist of your display name and, if you provide one, your profile picture and your posts and comments on or in connection with the FOX Services. Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and can be displayed in search results.
Third Party Information and Content. If you access a FOX Service through a third party connection or log-in or connect a FOX Service to a third party service, your user submitted information may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that third party service, any information/content you have permitted the third party to share with FOX, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Depending on what information you have submitted to the third party service, this may include, for instance, your name, email address, self-declared location, profile picture, gender, date of birth and hometown. When you access a FOX Service through a third party service or log-in or connect a FOX Service to a third party service, you are authorizing FOX to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all Third Party Information and Content.
FOX Collected Information
Transactional and Site Activity Information. When users access the FOX Services, we collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the FOX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FOX Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. FOX may also use cookies, pixels and similar tools to relate your use of the FOX Services to personal information obtained from you, from publicly available sources or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the FOX Websites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
Third parties that support the FOX Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use these technologies to collect similar information. FOX does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks and services that use these technologies, see aboutads.info, and to opt out of such ad networks' and services' collection and advertising practices, go to aboutads.info/choices.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the FOX Services.
Third Parties. To improve the quality of our services, FOX may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties or from publicly available sources. If you access a FOX Service through a third party connection or log-in or connect a FOX Service to a third party service, we may also collect Third Party Information and Content and combine that Third Party Information and Content with your Account Information and information we obtain from third parties or from publicly available sources.
