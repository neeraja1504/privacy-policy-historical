LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA AND SWITZERLAND VISITORS AND USERS ONLY) :  If you are a visitor or user based in the European Economic Area (“ EEA “), Snowflake, Inc., is the data controller of your personal information unless the data is collected in circumstances where one of our affiliates is running a local event, training session or survey, for example, and they collect and control that information.  In such circumstances, we will endeavor to make this clear to you in a context specific notification at the point we collect your personal information.
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
For more information on our legal basis for processing data please contact us using the details provided at the bottom of this Notice.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION :  We take all reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. The measures we take to protect your personal information while processing may include: physical access controls, encryption, internet firewalls, intrusion detection and network monitoring depending on the nature of the information and the scope of processing. Our staff who may have access to your information are required to keep that information confidential.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS : Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, and in some cases, may not be as protective.
Specifically, our website servers are located in the U.S., and our affiliates/partners and third-party service providers operate in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Germany, France, Netherlands, Australia, India. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between us and our business affiliates and associates to which we choose to transfer the information that requires these companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA or Switzerland in accordance with European Union data protection law.
Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We implement similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and further details can be provided upon request.
Please note we have additionally certified to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for limited international data transfers from the EEA and Switzerland, where we act as a processor on behalf of business customers based in the EEA and Switzerland and where we act as a controller regarding Snowflake human resources and internal business operations data from the EEA and Switzerland. For more information, please see our Privacy Shield Statement here.
YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES : You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. You may also send requests about your contact preferences and changes to your information including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties by emailing  privacy@snowflake.com .
CALIFORNIA USERS: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS : In addition, California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at  privacy@snowflake.com.
EEA AND SWITZERLAND USERS: YOUR   PRIVACY RIGHTS: In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland you have the following data protection rights:
If you wish to  access, correct, update or request deletion  of your Personal Information, you can do so at any time.
You can  object to processing  of your Personal Information, ask us to  restrict processing  of your Personal Information or  request portability  of your Personal Information.
If we have collected and process your Personal Information with your consent, then you can  withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the  right to complain  to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA are available  here and Switzerland here
If you wish to exercise any of these rights or want further information, please contact privacy@snowflake.com.
EEA AND SWITZERLAND USERS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF CUSTOMER CONTENT :  If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to the Service by or on behalf of a customer and you wish to exercise any data protection rights you may have in respect of that data under applicable law, including (as applicable) the right to access, port, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant customer directly. We have a limited ability to access Customer Content. However, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide the name of the customer who submitted your data to our Service.  We will refer your request to that customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
DATA RETENTION AND DELETION :  We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing, until deletion is possible.
When acting as processor (see Section “About our Services” above), we will retain Customer Content for as long as our Customer instructs us to and/or as required by applicable law.
CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE :  We may change this Notice from time to time. If we make any changes to this Notice, we will change the “Last Updated” date above.
