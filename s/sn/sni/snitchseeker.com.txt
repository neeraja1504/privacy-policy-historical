Privacy Policy - SnitchSeeker.com
Having such a large, popular site is expensive to run and requires several hundred dollars per month in various costs including a dedicated server and other fees. It would be greatly appreciated if avid visitors would click some of the banner or text ads that might appear on the site to help defray costs. If you would prefer to use an ad-blocker or opt out of ads, it would be great if you would send us a donation (PayPal funds to paypal@snitchseeker.com) every once in a while.
Below you will find our privacy policy, which we are required by law to display to our visitors. If you have any questions, please send me a PM or post it here.
Thanks for your continued support!
