Privacy - Dogster
Dogster.com Privacy Policy
Dogster.com is a website for sharing dog facts and photos with other dog lovers. It is operated by i-5 Publishing, LLC, a privately held company based in Irvine, CA, USA. Your personal privacy is EXTREMELY important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
By using Dogster.com, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of significant changes on the site. You should visit this page periodically to review any such changes to the Privacy Policy.
The information we collect
When you register to become a member of Dogster.com, we collect your name, email address and optionally your hometown, state and country. When you register your dog we collect the information you want to share about that canine, name, age, likes, dislikes, sex ,etc. Your name and email will never be shared, rented, bartered or sold with other users or third-party companies. All information entered about your dog(s) will only be used by Dogster.com to display on the site and will never be shared, rented, bartered, sold or exchanged any other purposeful manner. The website, however, is accessible by anyone with an internet connection and a web browser, which means that any words and photos you post can be copied by any other internet user. That is the nature of the internet and though we discourage anyone from abusing that option, it is something that must be noted
In order to provide the best possible service and detect and correct site errors, we collect aggregate information about use of the site (such as which page are most often viewed) and we collect information about your computer, such as such as browser type, browser language, and IP address. This information as well is never shared with anyone.
How we use your information
Your human name and email will never be shared with anyone in anyway. If you chose to enter your human hometown, state or country that information will be displayed in any of your dog’s web pages on the site, but the dog page does not share any other personal information or allow access to it. Currently we use your submitted email to notify you of Pup Pals friend requests, but the requestor never sees that email. When a user submits a Tell-A-Friend form we never store or copy any of the sender or recipient emails for any period of time.
We work with third parties who provide services, including but not limited to website hosting, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personally identifiable information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services. Further, we may use selected reputable third parties for marketing, targeting and analysis purposes. Some of these third parties may be given access to some, or all, of the information that you provide to us and may use cookies or other tracking technologies in connection with providing their services. To the extent that we provide your personally identifiable information to such third parties, we seek to restrict their ability to use such information for their own marketing purposes; however, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such third parties.
The biographical information you enter about your dog(s) is instantly available to all other users of the site. Dogster does not claim rights for the pictures uploaded or the text information you add to the site. Please note, however, that Dogster.com is a public site and thus all photos and information you provide are available to anyone with internet access. Due to the nature of the internet, it is impossible for Dogster.com to be a protectorate of your dog'(s’) facts and photos, so you should never post a photo or fact that you do not now or ever want someone else to have access to.
Legal requests
You understand and agree that Dogster.com may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect the rights and property of Dogster.com, its affiliates or the public.
Controlling your personal information
You have complete control of the information you submit to Dogster. You may at anytime edit any information or remove your dog and personal accounts entirely. Dogster.com only requires a user give a valid email while you have an account so we may contact you.
Please note, we reserve the right to transfer your submitted information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Dogster.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Dogster.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
