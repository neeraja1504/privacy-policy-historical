SGI - Privacy statement
You can rest assured that we'll protect and respect your personal information and privacy.
Saskatchewan Government Insurance ("SGI") is a Saskatchewan Crown Corporation incorporated under The Saskatchewan Government Insurance Act, 1980.
SGI operates the compulsory automobile and injury insurance program and the driver licensing and registration program for the Province of Saskatchewan. In addition, SGI, operating under the trade name SGI CANADA, maintains a property and casualty insurance division.
This Privacy Statement sets out the principles by which SGI collects, protects, uses and discloses the personal information of our customers and business partners. In Saskatchewan, SGI complies with the requirements of The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and, with certain restrictions, The Health Information Protection Act.
SGI maintains the privacy of your personal information and personal health information in accordance with the law and this notice.
Key privacy principles SGI follows:
Informing individuals of the purpose for which personal information and/or personal health information is collected.
Using personal information or personal health information only as required by law.
Not disclosing personal information or personal health information except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.
Except as may be limited by law, providing individuals with access to their personal information or personal health information. Where it is appropriate SGI amends this information to ensure continued accuracy and provides individuals with a means of having their privacy concerns managed.
SGI safeguards information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure based on the sensitivity of that information.
We protect your personal information by:
Limiting employee access to your personal information or personal health information. Only employees who need to know your information to do their job can access your personal information.
Maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to keep your personal information and personal health information safe and confidential.
Requiring our employees annually sign a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement to protect and hold your personal information in confidence.
Most access to our system, internally or externally, leaves a footprint. Those monitored transactions leave a trail of the access code of the person using the system and the day, time and what customer information was accessed.
If we share your information with a third-party service provider, we give them the least amount of information needed to provide the service we require, restrict their ability to use the information for any other purpose and require them to keep your information safe and hold it in confidence.
We will not process or store your personal information outside Canada without ensuring you are fully informed anytime your personal information or personal health information leaves Canada. View which products or services may result in your data leaving the country.

However, there are times when SGI will collect information about you from other insured persons, witnesses, law enforcement, technical experts we hire, hospitals, health care providers, medical practitioners, credit companies, underwriting tracking systems, other insurance companies, insurance brokers, our affiliates and other government ministries. For example, your doctor or optometrist must notify SGI if a medical condition makes you unfit to drive a motor vehicle.

SGI is administrator of Saskatchewan's compulsory automobile insurance program under The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. This program provides Saskatchewan residents with insurance coverage if they are injured in a motor vehicle collision. If you are seeking to obtain automobile injury benefits, the Act requires our customer to provide SGI with personal information and personal health information to determine entitlement to the statutory benefits under this program. If you do not provide SGI with the personal information requested, you can be denied benefits. SGI does not request more personal information or personal health information than required, but the nature of your claim or the injuries you sustain may require SGI to collect a significant amount of information.
Regulating our collection
On occasion, as a result of requesting your personal health information to determine your entitlement to SGI's automobile injury benefit program, SGI may obtain more personal health information than necessary to determine your entitlement to benefits. In these situations, SGI will make every effort to ensure that the unnecessary personal information is removed from your file where that information is easily separated from the personal health information SGI requires to determine your benefit entitlement. SGI will destroy that information in a confidential manner. If you have any concerns in this regard, please contact us for assistance.
For employment purposes:
SGI retains a database on individuals who have sought employment with SGI. This database retains all information provided to SGI by an applicant on the application for employment or in an applicant's resume. In addition, SGI retains the results of any employment or skill tests conducted by the applicant at SGI’s request for the purpose of determining a candidate’s suitability for employment. This information is held by the company exclusively for the purpose of recruitment and hire.

Disclosing your information
When you submit an application for insurance through your broker or apply for insurance online, and you are applying for insurance with all member companies with SGI.

To obtain a credit score for rating purposes.
If you request or consent to the release of your information to a 3rd party, SGI will release your information as requested. For example, when you access your SGI information on the MySGI website and associate yourself with an Issuer, you are agreeing to the release of your driver licensing and vehicle registration information to that Licence Issuer.
SGI is required to comply with The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. This Act not only sets out our obligations to protect your personal information, but indicates when that information may be disclosed without your consent.

Licence Issuers
To better assist the Saskatchewan public in obtaining driver licence and vehicle registration services, SGI contracts with independent Licence Issuers to provide these services in various communities.  All Licence Issuers have access to the SGI Driver Licensing and Vehicle Registration Database for the purpose of providing this service.  The release of this information is subject to strict confidentiality requirements.
Personal Health Information
The collection of your personal health information for no-fault injury benefits is used only by the SGI Claims Division; it is not shared with other departments in SGI other than SGI’s Medical Review Unit.  Information is only shared with the SGI Medical Review Unit in a situation where the personal health information collected by SGI during the administration of your injury benefits indicates you have a medical condition that may impact on  your ability to drive a motor vehicle.
Your personal health information is only disclosed by SGI for the purpose of providing you with automobile injury benefits. Unless required by law, we do not share your personal health information with our affiliates or with any 3rd parties except to provide you with injury benefits. Your personal health information may be disclosed to medical consultants, lawyers or other professional experts (e.g. vocational or rehabilitation consultants, physiotherapist, etc.) SGI hires to assist them in determining your entitlement to benefits, your rehabilitation needs, the extent of your injuries from a motor vehicle collision, and the type of treatment that your insurance coverage must provide. Subject to a legal requirement to disclose your information, the confidentiality of your personal information and personal health information is a requirement of any disclosure. If you appeal a decision SGI makes regarding your entitlement to benefits to either the courts or the Automobile Injury Appeal Commission, SGI may disclose your personal health information for the purpose of defending its decision.
