When you authorize any of our applications to access your Facebook account, we collect and store some information about you, such as your Facebook identifier which we use to personalize our applications specifically for you. The full list of information we collect is presented to you on the Facebook authorization screen.
Our web sites automatically collect your IP address (that’s a fancy word for the name of your computer on Internet) and watch what you do on the site.  We also track where you come from in the world.  Again, we use this information to learn how we can make the experience better for you.
We also track other global statistics such as how many people are using our applications and how they use them (for example, what buttons they click on and which features they use and what content they consume).  This allows us to tune our applications to focus on features and content most enjoyed by our users.
When you visit us from another site, our web sites are able to tell which web site you’re coming from. We use this information to stay informed about how people are finding us.
Our web sites are also able to tell certain characteristics about your computer like the operating system you run, the browser you use and your screen size. We use this information to make sure that our web site is designed to look its best on your computer.
If you access any of our products through a mobile application, we may store information that allows us to identify your mobile device. This allows us, amongst other things, to enforce restrictions related to “Lite” mobile applications, and to automatically transfer your settings between versions of the mobile application (e.g. between Status Shuffle and Status Shuffle Lite).
Finally, we will sometimes collect additional information from you for the purposes of enhancing the targeting of our advertisements that we may share with third-party advertisers. We only share generic information that cannot uniquely identify you.
