Privacy Policy | DTS
Last Revised: April 23, 2018
DTS, Inc. ("DTS") respects your privacy. This DTS Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make regarding the information we collect about you. This Privacy Statement applies to all DTS-owned websites, services, mobile applications and products, and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("Sites or Services"), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular DTS program, product, or service may supersede or supplement this Privacy Statement.
Your use of our Sites or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use (http://www.dts.com/terms-of-use.aspx).
Collection of Your Personal Information
Information You Provide to Us
We receive information from users who are interested in obtaining information about our technologies or services, or users who purchase products from our Sites or Services. Typically, the information includes your name, user name, user ID, user password, email address, mailing address, and telephone number. We may collect information such as age, gender, user preferences, and user activities on our Sites or Services. We collect your information that you provide to us when you participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other entries; send us email messages; and/or receive other Services on or through our Sites. In connection with contests or other entries, you may be asked to provide information regarding your social media accounts, including your social media IDs or links to your social media. You do not have to provide any of your information to us, but if you do not provide your information, we may not be able to provide the Services to you (for example, we may not be able to process your online requests or transactions, or you may not be able to participate in the online contests, sweepstakes, or other entries).
Information Collected Automatically
Through cookies, web beacons and other technologies, we may automatically collect information such as your domain name, browser type and operating system, web pages and links you view, IP address, the length of time you visit our Sites, and the referring URL or the webpage that led you to our Sites.  We may collect information about your use of our mobile application, mobile device ID, location and language information, device name and model, operating system, your activities within the application, and the length of time that you are logged into our application.  Please see the section "What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?" below for more information about our use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms.
Our Use of Browser Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites or Services.  We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites or Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites or Services.  We use two types of browser cookies - session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into our Sites.  This allows us to process your online transactions and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.
We may also engage third parties to track and analyze information about your use of our Sites or Services.  We use the information collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of our Sites or Services.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.  This Privacy Statement does not cover third parties' use of the information.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Users to our Sites or Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites or Services, but some features may not function.
Our Sites or Services, marketing partners, and third party websites linked to our Sites or Services, may use local shared  objects, also known as flash cookies ("Flash LSOs") to store your site preferences and to personalize your visit (such as setting the volume level last used to play a video).  Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.  Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser, but you may do so by visiting the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/sett... For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, please visit the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, select "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions.  To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, select "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions to review and, if you wish, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies and Flash LSOs, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of site users, manage content, and compile statistics about Sites usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
We use third party web analytics to evaluate usage of our Sites or Services.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Sites or Services.  We use these tools to help us improve our Sites or Services, or improve performance and user experiences.  The information collected through web analytics may be shared with third party analytics service providers. Our Sites or Services may contain links to third party websites.  If you provide any information to third party websites, other privacy policies may apply to the collection or use of your information on those sites.
Third party websites linked to our Sites or Services, and marketing or advertising partners may collect information about you and your computer network over time and across different websites to provide targeted or personalized advertising (also referred to as online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).  Some third party marketing partners comply with the protocols of the Networking Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which give users choices about how their personal information is tracked and used.  You can opt-out of receiving ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who subscribe to the NAI or DAA by visiting the opt-out pages at www.networkadvertising.org (NAI homepage) and www.aboutads.info(DAA homepage).  For more information about the privacy practices of third party advertisers, please visit their websites and review their policies or contact them directly.
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions at www.networkadvertising.org and www.aboutads.info.
Information Provided Through Your Use of Social Media
Our Sites or Services enhance user experience by providing ways to communicate with us and other users through various third party social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and YouTube.  By logging in to a third party social media service used to communicate on the Sites or Services, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable third party social media service to share with us in accordance with the privacy settings that apply to your account with the third-party social media services you use to communicate on the Sites or Services, and to combine that information with other information we have from or about you.

Security of Your Personal Information
In an effort to maintain the security and confidentiality of your personal information, we have implemented several security measures to prevent the unauthorized access and use of your personal information. We review these security measures from time to time and evaluate new technologies or approaches that would further enhance the security measures currently in place. Please be informed that despite our best efforts, no security measures are impenetrable. We ask that you safeguard any user password or user ID obtained for use on our Sites or Services as these are personal to each user and link to personal information or other information that may be used to identify you. Each user takes full responsibility for any misuse or unauthorized use of our Sites or Services.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account by unauthorized password activity.
