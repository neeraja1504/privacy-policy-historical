INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS
SriLankan is an international commercial airline operating in many different jurisdictions and, accordingly, Customer Data collected in one jurisdiction might be stored, transferred, or accessed worldwide in different jurisdictions. The protections for Customer Data differ from one jurisdiction to another and thus when transferred, your Customer Data may be subject to different or lesser protections than in your country of residence.  By providing your Customer Data, you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of such Data to jurisdictions that may have lesser protections for Customer Data.
CONSENT AND UPDATES
By providing information to SriLankan or one of our service providers, you  acknowledge the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and you consent to be bound by this Policy.
You should ensure that the information we hold about you is current and accurate at all times.  .  If you have a dedicated account with SriLankan, you may login to that account and update your information as necessary.  You also may have a right under applicable data protection law to access, amend, and/or request deletion of other information that we collect about you. To do so, please contact us at Customer@srilankan.com.  In some cases, we may charge a nominal fee for processing such a request.  Although SriLankan shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the Customer Data, it shall have the right to verify the details in any request made to update Customer Data.
SriLankan reserves the right to refuse to disclose the information that we hold if any law enforcement authority instructs us not to disclose information or, in the reasonable opinion of SriLankan, such disclosure could otherwise be harmful to SriLankan or any third party.  For example, requests made in connection with fraudulent activities or in contravention of law will be refused.
You may withdraw your consent to receive promotional emails either by unsubscribing through the link provided in such an email or by changing the settings in your personal account with us.
COOKIES
SriLankan may use cookies to enhance your experience in searching our services.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are sent to your computer when you visit websites and online services.  If your web browser’s preferences are set to accept it, the cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies enable our and other websites to recognize your preferences and to tailor content to you.
Like many websites, SriLankan,com does not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers.  But you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored.  We respect your choice to accept or reject any cookies.  However, your rejection of cookies may prevent you from using some of the features on our website or mobile services.
SECURITY
In order to safeguard Customer Data, SriLankan has in place commercially reasonable technical and procedural mechanisms.  However, no level of security can entirely eliminate the risk of unauthorized access or use of data collected and stored online.  Moreover, you should take care not to disclose your information online, including in any social media, and you should take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of your Customer Data.
The third party websites linked to on SriLankan’s website are operated by third parties.  SriLankan does not endorse any of these websites and shall not be responsible for the information, content, accuracy, or opinions expressed in such third party websites.  Moreover, when you access and use any third party website, the information that you disclose is subject to the privacy policies of those websites, and not this Privacy Policy.
