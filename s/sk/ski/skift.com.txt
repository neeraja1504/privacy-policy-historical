HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

Skift collects personal information in a variety of ways, including when you subscribe to or use Skift products or services; when you subscribe to Skift newsletters, daily, weekly, speciality, and similar email notices; when you register for or participate in Skift Forum and other events such as, virtual educational programs such as seminars, webinars, etc., that Skift conducts from time to time; when you visit Skift website or the websites of certain Skift Partners; and when you enter Internet-based contests, promotions or sweepstakes sponsored or administered by Skift; when you download reports or editorial pieces such as Oral History Projects, digital magazines, etc; and when you purchase Skift Products such as Research Subscription.
When you register on our website or for our products and services, we ask for and collect information such as, but not limited to; your name, email address, company, job title, country, zip code, and industry. For some products and services we may also ask for your address and information about you or your business’s assets or income. Once you register with Skift and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
If you are purchasing something from a Skift website, we need to know personal information such as your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by Skift to notify you of related products and services. Credit card information will not be shared or sold to unaffiliated third parties for any purpose without your express permission, except as necessary to process the transaction.
TRANSPARENCY AND CHOICE
People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example:
Wherever it is optional to collect additional information about you, we transparently inform you about what information we need, why we ask for it and we require your consent to process such information. When you change your mind, there is always a convenient way how to let us know.
You can always set your own Cookie preferences and therefore decide whether you agree to be on our radar when it comes to ads or behavior analytics or not.

We’re committed to our users enjoying Skift to help them understand and prepare for the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR is the most comprehensive EU data privacy law in decades, and will come into effect on May 25, 2018.
As well as strengthening and unifying user data privacy across the EU, it also puts new or additional obligations upon anyone that handles EU citizens’ personal data, regardless of where they are located.
Below, we’ll explain our approach to achieving GDPR-compliance, both for ourselves and for our Customers.
SKIFT WAY AND ADOPTION
The GDPR’s updated requirements are significant and our team is working hard to bring Skift’s service offerings and contractual commitments in line so Customers can prepare themselves before May 25, 2018. Measures taken to achieve this include:
Changes in our newsletter sign ups. We updated all opt-in checkboxes to require an action taken. All language with exactly what you are signing up for is on forms/landing pages across products.
Investments under the hood. We are working on improvements to our infrastructure, to fulfill all the requirements and obligations connected to continuous security monitoring, data breaches and security incident management.
Legal matters. Any Customer willing to enter into a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Skift is welcome to use our template. Please reach out to us at infosecurity@skift.com to learn more about next steps.
Policies. We have already updated our Privacy Policy. This is not the end of the story, we are working on our internal policies and practices to ensure that we are aligned with the GDPR requirements.
We’ll also continue to monitor the guidance around GDPR compliance from privacy-related regulatory bodies, and will adjust our plans accordingly if it changes.
STAY UPDATED
Fulfilling our privacy and data security commitments is important to us. So we’re happy to help you prepare for all the changes the GDPR brings. This page will be revised to reflect GDPR-related information as it becomes available.
