Disclosure of Information to Others
We disclose to third parties within your country and abroad your personal information, combined personal, demographic or behavioral information, as set forth below.

We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals may be located in a country whose data protection legislation is different from your country, and they will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose.
2. We supply your contact information to select third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.

We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to the Site with JoBookIT’s clients, partners, other Site visitors, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Site and how those visitors use the Site. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such data may be made available to employers or fellow job seekers or community members.
3. We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

An Important Note about Your Resume
When you create or post a resume to the Site, that resume is stored in our database.
All parties (including potential employers or others) with access to our database (or copies thereof) may have access to your resume and information. Employers or other parties with access to database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. By giving us information, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of data occurring. Your information (including your resume) may be transferred to various potential employers, who may retain a copy of such information or distribute it to third parties, subject to local law. We cannot control their use and retention of your information.
We attempt to limit access to our database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes or other information by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our database. You may make your resume unsearchable at any time; details of how to do this are given below. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your resume.
If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so.
If you use our facilities to build a resume or to post a resume in our database, then you will be providing us with personal data we will use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your resume must not contain sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or genetic makeup, or (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines. If your resume does contain such data, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information from our database.
Your Choices About Your Information

You may have access to, review, correct, update and change your account profile information or resume at any time.

Before providing you with a copy of your personal information or correcting, updating or making such information unsearchable, we reserve the right to verify and authenticate your identity and the personal information to which you have requested access.

An email will be sent to you to confirm that your personal information has been made inaccessible to employers or other parties. An archival copy which is not accessible by you or third parties on the Internet shall be retained only for as long as JoBookIT reasonably considers necessary for audit and record purposes.

If your personal information was previously accessed by others using our Site, we are not able to delete the information or copies thereof from their systems.

Important Information
Security
You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials (your username and password) are kept confidential.
JoBookIT has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your resume and profile widely and to maximize your career opportunities. Accordingly, such an environment does present a risk that unauthorized third parties will view this data. Further, your resume should not contain any sensitive data including personality profiles or data that you would not want made public. You should be aware that resumes you complete at your current place of work may be monitored by your current employer.

Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script
Cookies: JobookIt uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer’s memory temporarily (a “session” cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a “persistent” cookie) by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
When you return to the Site, cookies enable us to retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the features that you customized. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience
We also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are visiting our Site. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. JoBookIt has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third party advertisers. Privacy Policy encourages you to review the policies of such advertisers. We use other third party ad servers as well; a way to opt out of third party cookies is to modify your browser settings to decline.
We allow persistent third party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to determine and track site traffic landing from JobookIt’s advertising banners that have been placed on the websites of third parties. The data collected via these cookies is anonymous and the information is not linked to your personally identifiable information without your permission. The “persistent” cookies placed by our third party ad servers will remain on your computer after you have left our site for up to 20 years.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the web site.
*Web Beacons: JoBookIt Web pages may also contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the Site; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.
JavaScript: JoBookIt also uses JavaScript, for example, within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a script language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We are not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to inform employers about how many applicants have clicked on email addresses embedded in their job ads, for example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of the website.
Thank you for using the Site.
