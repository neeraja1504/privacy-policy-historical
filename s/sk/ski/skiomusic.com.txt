We created this Privacy Policy (this “ ** Policy ”) to give you, the user, confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy. By visiting the Site, you consent to our collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Policy.

Personal information does not include information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee’s name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. We will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with Applicable Privacy Legislation. To learn more about the Applicable Privacy Legislation please visit http://www.priv.gc.ca/leg_c/leg_c_p_e.asp or https://www.oipc.bc.ca/about/legislation.aspx.
As required by the Applicable Privacy Legislation, we have appointed a Privacy Officer who is responsible for compliance with this Privacy Policy and Applicable Privacy Legislation. Information on how to contact the Privacy Officer can be found below. Our Privacy Officer also serves as our Data Protection Officer for the purposes of European data protection legislation.
