Privacy Policy
As SkinBase is a general-age website, we ask that all registered users behave in an appropriate manner at all times. As stated in the above Submissions Policy, we do not allow the use of offensive material. Do not post material that is pornographic, racial or hate-based. SkinBase reserves the right to cancel a member's account along with all files submitted by that member at any given time without warning. SkinBase also allows its users to remove their submitted artwork at any given time. If a submitted piece of work is found to be not that of it's submitting artist (aka - a rip), then action will be taken to have that piece removed. Repeat offenders will have their accounts cancelled. If you'd like to notify SkinBase of such a submission, please feel free to contact a site admin.

Information is collected at several points from users of the SkinBase site. SkinBase is the sole owner of this information and will not sell or disclose it to any third party.
Information is gathered in the following situations:
Cookies
SkinBase uses cookies to help make each user's visit easier and more interactive. By storing a cookie, the user does not have to log in to the site each time he/she visits the site and the user also gets to use features such as the messageboard and online chat. Cookies are in no way linked to the personal information disclosed at signup.
IP Logging
SkinBase also logs IP addresses to help administer the website and track user's actions on the website. These details do not contain any personally identifiable information.
Sharing of Information
SkinBase will only share information with third parties if required to do so by law, or if by doing so we can protect the SkinBase website and/or it's users. If you do not wish for others to know your personal details (for example - name and email address), it is recommended that you do not apply for membership.
Links
SkinBase links to several other websites. SkinBase does not control the content of any outside websites and can not be held accountable for their content. We also are not in control of the privacy policies of these sites and recommend that all members carefully read the privacy policies of other websites that collect personally identifiable information.
Children under the Age of 13
As SkinBase is a general-audience website, we can not allow children under the age of 13 to sign up for membership (in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). We ask that parents instead sign up for membership and monitor their children's activity on the website.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
If we make changes to this policy, we will let members know by posting mention of the changes on the homepage of the SkinBase website. If we decide to use the personal details collected at membership signup (or during any other stage of a user's onsite activity) in any manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will let the user know via email. Users will be given a choice as to whether they want their information used in a different manner.
