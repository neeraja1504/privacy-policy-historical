What are my rights with data?
The Data Protection Act 1998 (see ico.org.uk for more information) gives individuals certain rights as it defines the rules for processing personal information. It also states that those who record and process personal information, such as the Society, must be open and honest in how the information is used.
Why do you collect data?
The principal purpose of collecting personal data from you via this website is to assist in the efficient running of your accounts or to provide information or services specifically requested by you. When you complete our online enquiry forms, we ask for your contact details and other selected information, so that we can deal with your request as efficiently and effectively as possible.
How do I access or change the information we hold?
The Act also allows you to find out what information the Society holds about you in return for a small fee. This is known as a "Data Subject Access Request." If you wish to know what information the Society holds about you, please write to the:
