Where We Store Your Personal Data
Transfers inside of the European Economic Area
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers, within the European Economic Area ("EEA").
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website and apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access, including keeping security patches up to date wherever possible, and by constantly investigating new ways to keep data secure.
Transfers outside of the European Economic Area
The data that we collect from you will be transferred to our US entity in order to be processed by our Marketing, our Community, and our Operations teams. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. In particular, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. Sketchfab's compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the context of an onward transfer, Sketchfab has responsibility for the processing of personal information we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Sketchfab shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if this agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the alleged damage. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Please note that, for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, we may transfer your personal data to our service providers based outside of the European Union in countries which are not considered as providing an adequate level of protection by the EU Commission.
We guarantee that we will take all necessary measures to secure these data transfers in accordance with the GDPR (through Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield).

Exercising Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data
Before processing your personal data and, at the latest, at the time of collection of your personal data, we inform you of the purpose of the processing of your personal data, the recipients of this data, the retention period applied to your personal data as well as your rights in this context.
Under French law n°78-17 dated 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties as amended and, after 25 May 2018, under the GDPR, you have the right to access, to rectify, to restrict and, where applicable, to delete your personal data. You also hold the right to data portability.
You have the right to request access to your Personal Data |  You have the right to request confirmation that your Personal Data is being processed, access to your Personal Data (through us providing a copy) and other information about how we process your Personal Data.
---|---
You have the right to ask us to rectify your Personal Data |  You have the right to request that we rectify your Personal Data if it is not accurate or not complete.
You have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Data |  You have the right to ask us to erase or delete your Personal Data where there is no reason for us to continue to process your Personal Data. This right would apply if we no longer need to use your Personal Data to provide the Service to you, where you withdraw your consent for us to process special categories of your Personal Data, or where you object to the way we process your Personal Data (see the section "You have the right to object..." within this table below).
You have the right to ask us to restrict or block the processing of your Personal Data |  You have the right to ask us to restrict or block the processing of your Personal Data that we hold about you. This right applies where you believe the Personal Data is not accurate, you would rather we block the processing of your Personal Data rather than erase your Personal Data, and where we don't need to use your Personal Data for the purpose we collected it for but you may require it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
You have the right to port your Personal Data |  You have the right to obtain and reuse your Personal Data from us to reuse (in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format) for your own purposes across different services. This allows you to move Personal Data easily to another organization, or to request us to do this for you.
You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data |  You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data on the basis of our legitimate business interests, unless we are able to demonstrate that, on balance, our legitimate interests override your rights or we need to continue processing your Personal Data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims. However, you also have the absolute right to object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions |  You have the right to object to any automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision has a legal or significant impact on you.
You have the right to withdraw your consent |  You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data.
You can exercise these rights, with a proof of your identity, by simple written request sent by email to privacy@sketchfab.com.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at privacy@sketchfab.com. We have further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU.
We will respond to any request received from you within one month from the date of the request. If your request is not sufficiently precise or does not include all elements enabling us to answer your request, Sketchfab may ask you to provide additional elements.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection national.
