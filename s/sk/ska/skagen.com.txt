Skagen Privacy Policy and Legal Notice, Terms and Conditions
Because Skagen Denmark values your patronage and respects your privacy rights, we are voluntarily providing you with this statement of our Privacy Policy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for skagen.com and any site from which you access this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Website").
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
"Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. The Personal Information that Skagen Denmark collects includes Personal Information collected in any Skagen Denmark Stores, the Skagen Denmark Website, any Skagen Denmark mobile application, or by any of our service providers through our website or in our stores.  Please note that this Privacy Policy DOES NOT apply to information we collected through any SKAGEN App or SKAGEN Branded device.  Please refer to the Privacy Policies in the Skagen App for information on privacy for that information. The Personal Information that Skagen Denmark collects depends on the nature of your activities, including, but not limited to, whether you make a purchase or order, make a return, make an exchange, complete a survey, contact us for information, register for a promotion, join a forum, download software, create an account on the website, write a review, create a wishlist and proceed through the checkout process on the website. Personal Information that Skagen Denmark may collect from you may include your name, address, email address, your employer, phone number, your login and password, order information, and comments that may identify you, and other information.
HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Skagen Denmark uses Your Personal Information to identify you to respond to your online email requests, to register you for certain activities/access on the Website at your request and to confirm that registration, to help identify you in the event you lose your password, to process your warranty and repair requests, to process returns and exchanges, to process personal shopper requests, to process catalog requests, to process email marketing requests, to process product reviews, to process your entry into sweepstakes or promotions, to provide you with free gifts and other promotional offers, to notify you of changes made to our policies, to combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others, and to otherwise maximize your access to our services and products, and order processing/fulfillment. With respect to use of the Website, without transmitting your Personal Information, you can still use most of our Website, however, you will not be able to send us email inquiries, access certain features/sections, complete a survey, register online for giveaways, request a catalog, request email marketing notifications, write product reviews, create a wish list, or make an online purchase.
We may contact you for direct marketing purposes per e-mail, mail, or via other electronic communication methods (e.g. social media) unless you have opted-out from receiving further direct marketing messages (see below for your opt-out options). For certain types of direct marketing methods (e.g. text messaging), we will obtain your explicit consent prior to sending you direct marketing messages.
In furtherance of the foregoing uses, your Personal Information may also be shared with Skagen Denmark' employees, agents, representatives, and selected third party service providers or partners (as set forth further below) who will be under an obligation to Skagen Denmark to use reasonable care to keep this information confidential and are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to us. Skagen Denmark may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps facilitate our direct marketing communications. In those instances, there is a need to share your Personal Information with these contracted companies. Your opt-out choices below will not apply to sharing of your information by Skagen Denmark with any of these companies.
Where we engage service providers that use Personal Information on behalf of us we will use reasonable measures to contractually ensure that Personal Information is only used for the purposes defined by us and (provided that your Personal Information is subject to the Privacy Shield) we will remain liable for the requirement that processing of Personal Information by a service provider is consistent with our instructions unless we are not responsible for such inconsistent processing.
Unless you have opted out of such marketing use as set forth herein, occasionally we may also share your Personal Information with select third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services ("promotional purposes") offered by them. We may also share your Personal Information with organizations that represent multiple third parties who either may send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by those third parties or share your Personal Information with those third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. We may also occasionally share your Personal Information with organizations that combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and other third parties. We use that combined information to enhance your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products, to inform you of events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. We also may share that combined information with third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. When sharing your information for promotional purposes, Skagen Denmark attempts to select reputable companies that offer high quality products and services. When we share your Personal Information with a third party, your Personal Information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your Personal Information. You may choose to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties as described below.
In the event that you enter into a sweepstakes or other giveaway, your Personal Information may be shared according to the rules of that particular sweepstakes, giveaway or promotion. Any personal information you include in the text of a product review may be made public in the product review section of the website. The information contained in your wish list may be shared with the friends and family that you instruct us to share it with.
In addition to the foregoing uses, Skagen Denmark may also disclose Personal Information:
to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process;
to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
to protect and defend Skagen Denmark, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute;
to enforce the Terms of Use of our Website; and
in connection with the purchase of a business or a sale of one or more of our businesses or its assets, provided that any purchasing party agrees to adhere to terms similar to those of this Privacy Policy (if your information is subject to Privacy Shield we will provide you with an opportunity to reject the transfer of your Personal Information in such cases); and
to prevent imminent physical harm.
Generally, you may not opt-out of service related communications, which are not promotional in nature. Nor will your opt-out choices apply to sharing by Skagen Denmark of your Personal Information with the service providers or partners used by Skagen Denmark to enhance your experience on the Website and/or to allow Skagen Denmark to provide you with more personalized promotional materials, as set forth in this Privacy Policy. However, you can opt-out of direct promotional communications from Skagen Denmark, or sharing of Personal Information with third parties for the purposes of promotional communications, by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication or emailing us at skagen@skagen.com.
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Skagen Denmark will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any Personal Information obtained through Skagen Denmark or from third parties without your consent. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and any choices you make on the Website will not necessarily apply to Personal Information you may have provided to any third parties in the context of other, separately operated, operations or in connection with unrelated products or services.
The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, by using Skagen Denmark’s websites or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you are also consenting to the application of United States federal and Texas state law in all matters concerning the Site and this Privacy Policy.
GENERAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE
"General Information" is information we collect through your connection and interaction with our Website. General Information does not identify you, personally - for instance, we can't identify your name or address from your Internet browser address, but we can use General Information to compile statistics about visitors to our Website and preferences of our visitors. General Information we collect when you visit our Website includes the domain and host from which you access the Internet (ex: aol.com), the Internet protocol address ("IP Address") of the computer you are using (this is the number used by computers on a network to identify them to other computers), the browser software you are using, the operating system you are using, the date and time that you access our Website, the specific pages you visit at our Website, the number of visits you make to our Website, the number of visits to specific pages you make at our Website, and products or services viewed at our Website.
We use the General Information we collect to perfect and administer our Website, analyze trends, and generate aggregate statistics about visitors to our Website. In situations where it is possible to do so, General Information may be linked to Personal Information. Further, Skagen Denmark may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable General Information, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing the information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our right to aggregate or de-personalize your Personal Information, and we may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable General Information in any way.
COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS
A cookie is an element of data that frequently contains an anonymous unique identifier. Such data is sent from the website to your browser, which may then store it on your system for future use. Our Website uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to honor your preferences, such as not using frames.
Web beacons are clear image files that may be placed on a website to monitor the behavior of visiting users of the website. Web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies and assist in passing along the same type of General Information, such as the IP address, time, and duration that a web page was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values.
Our Website collects information through a variety of technical methods, including cookies and web beacons. These methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may use the information collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including delivering content, tracking or enhancing your experience on our Website. We may also use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website or third party websites, such as the frequency with which you visit certain parts of the Website or third party websites. In HTML e-mails that we send you, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including: to determine whether you have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, to customize the display of banner advertisements, and to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular e-mail. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept or reject it. You may not be able to conduct some transactions or use some services on our Website if you disable your browser from accepting cookies.
CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT ("COPPA")
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from our Website about children under the age of 13. We request that persons under the age of 13 not use our Website without supervision from a responsible adult. We will never request Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has sent Personal Information to us without prior parental consent, we will remove his or her Personal Information from our files.
SECURITY
Skagen Denmark has implemented a variety of security measures to prevent the unauthorized release of, access to, or use of Personal Information collected through our Website. For example, we store your Personal Information on computer servers that are located in controlled facilities and that have limited access. We have set up technical security measures such as browser encryption, routers and firewalls to safeguard Personal Information against unauthorized access. Our servers are located in the United States. Please be advised, however, that no security system is impenetrable/fail-proof. The secure servers are not generally accessible by unauthorized third parties, but could become accessible in the event of a security breach. Skagen Denmark has no control over the security of computers or other electronic devices of others or over means you use to send emails and submit information to Skagen Denmark over the Internet. Therefore, Skagen Denmark cannot ensure safety regarding the disclosure or interception of your information before it is received by Skagen Denmark.
LINKS TO OTHER MATERIALS
If any link is offered connecting to a third-party website, it is for the convenience of our Website visitors and as an accommodation to the respective third-party site owner and without charge. Skagen Denmark reserves the right to reject any request for a link to a third-party website and to remove any link for any reason. Sites linked to and from this Website are not necessarily under the control of Skagen Denmark and Skagen Denmark shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. If you click on an advertisement or link on the Website and link to a third party’s website, then this Privacy Policy will not apply to your personally identifiable information collected on that third party's website and you must read the privacy policy on that website to see how your information will be handled.
OPT OUT PROCEDURES
With regard to Personal Information that you have provided or that has been collected under this Privacy Policy, you may opt out of uses of that information that are promotional in nature, such as correspondence from us about our products and promotions or the sharing by us of your Personal Information with select third parties for promotional purposes. There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out/do not share preferences: (a) during registration on the Website; (b) after registration, by logging into your account on the Website and following the opt-out directions; and (c) by following the directions provided in an email to you.

Each of the opt-out and "do not share" procedures and choices are subject to the exceptions described in this Privacy Policy. Further, any opt-out/do not share choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from Skagen Denmark or voluntarily enter into a contest, survey or other promotion being hosted by Skagen Denmark, (b) Skagen Denmark uses your Personal Information for operational or non-promotional uses such as completing transactions requested by you, sharing your Personal Information with our marketing partners to enhance your experience on the Website, or to send you administrative communications either about your account or about features of the Website, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, or (c) you provide personal information about other persons (however, these persons will have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional materials).
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you do not exercise your opt-out or "do not share" choices upon registration on the Website, it may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective.
