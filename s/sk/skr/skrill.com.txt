3.2. All your transactions are processed using secure communication standards such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with 128-bit encryption. You should always make sure that your browser is compatible with SSL encryption and the appropriate browser functions are set. When starting an SSL session, your browser should indicate this by displaying a lock or similar security icon.
3.3. We use reasonable efforts not to disclose information to any third party except for the reasons set forth in below or with your consent.
3.4. We will only disclose information to our employees who have a need to know such information for the fulfillment of their duties. Employees are regularly trained to comply with this privacy policy.
3.5. Where we disclose information to a third party for operational reasons, we require such third party to adhere to privacy principles similar to those set forth in this policy.
4. When and to whom we disclose your information
4.1. We may disclose all or part of your information to
our affiliates for operational reasons
service providers that we use to provide services to you
Card Associations and their members and members' agents and service providers
credit reference agencies and I.D. verification agencies
fraud prevention and detection agencies
debt collection agencies for the purposes of collecting outstanding balances owed to us or any other debt owed to us
selected marketing agencies or other third parties that use your information for marketing purposes, unless you have opted out of receiving communications from such third parties (see next section) or if the laws of the state in which you reside prevents us from doing so.
4.2. If you do not want us to share your information with selected marketing agencies or other third parties for marketing purposes you may opt out of those disclosures at any time by checking the appropriate box in your User Profile which you can access on our website or by contacting Customer Service.
4.3. If you cease to be Skrill’s customer, your information will not be disclosed to third parties, except to affiliates for operational reasons or regulatory agencies or the purposes permitted by law.
4.4. The U.S. law now requires income received through credit and debit card transactions to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Banks and merchant services must report annual gross payments processed by credit or debit cards to the IRS and to merchants. In other words, we will be required to provide these reports by end of January for the payments made in the previous calendar year. The format of these reports must resemble the 1099K forms that report certain type of income in the U.S.
You acknowledge that Skrill will report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of the payments you receive each calendar year into all the Accounts you own if you (i) receive more than $20,000, and (ii) receive more than 200 payments, in that calendar year.
