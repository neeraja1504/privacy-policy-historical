A. Disclosure to Network and Maintenance Contractors
People working on our behalf to maintain the web site may sometimes have limited access to your username, email address, and URL in the course of providing products or services to Skribit. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our web site. Unless you notify us otherwise, these contractors also may have access to any additional information you provided to us such as your real name, company, and title in the course of their testing. The only personally identifiable information accessible to these contractors is the minimum required to create an account (your username, email address, and URL). This is the minimum necessary for the contractor to perform their limited functions for Skribit.

B. Disclosure of Aggregate Information
Skribit may provide general aggregate information to third parties. This sort of statistical data is called aggregate information because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Web Sites may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users.
We require parties with whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable in any way, such as by combining it with other databases.

We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
