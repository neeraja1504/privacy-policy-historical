Platforms
In the course of providing our Service on third party platforms, such as Apple’s App Store, the platforms may collect Information about you or receive Information from us in order for the platform to provide or analyze their services. Please note that these platforms were developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Skout and that Skout is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies. You should carefully review the terms of service and privacy policies of the platforms that you use to access our Service.
How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
We use Information for the following purposes:
to administer our websites and provide our services or information you request
to process and complete any transactions;
to promote Skout in general;
to provide you with advertising of interest to you;
to identify your location to other Skout users, if you choose to enable this feature;
to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, and complaints and provide customer service;
to provide you with additional points and rewards from watching video advertisements, and to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our services;
to monitor and analyze user behavior and trends;
to track visitor movement and activity in the aggregate (for example, to give us information about what parts of the websites users are visiting)
to personalize and improve Skout products and features and your experiences when you use Skout, such as providing content or features that match your profile, location or interests;
to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, our services;
help prevent fraud or other misuse
to connect with your friends (when instructed by you); and
for any other stated purpose for which the Information was collected.
In addition, we may use your email address to send you emails for both transactional (e.g., confirmation of or issues with Services) and promotional purposes (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications and third-party offers). Email messages we send to you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the emails, including whether the email was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive promotional emails from us, please see the section in each email labeled "Choice/Opt-Out".
With Whom Do We Share Your Information?
We may share Information as follows:
with in-app advertisers or advertising networks for the purpose of providing advertising of interest to you within Skout or advertising Skout in other locations;
with analytics providers for the purpose of analyzing user data;
with service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our site or our services;
anonymous or aggregate data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes;
when you give us your consent to do so;
when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders;
to enforce or apply our privacy policy, our terms of use or our other policies or agreements;
to protect the rights, property, or safety of Skout, our users, or others; and
in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.
What Information Can the Other Users See?
A main purpose of using Skout is to meet and interact with new people. The information you enter in your profile, including your backstage pics, your location (if you enable that feature), photos you upload to your profile, and virtual gifts you receive, are visible to all Skout users within your age category. Other Skout users may also see the fact that you have viewed their Skout profiles.
Any text and images you send to a chat recipient will be visible to that recipient. Skout also has "backstage pics," which are pictures posted by a user on his or her profile. Backstage pics can be seen by another user if he or she pays with Skout points to "unlock" another user’s backstage pics. The "unlock" is valid for 24 hours. There is no explicit acceptance by a user posting backstage pics required in order to let another user view the backstage pics. We review all public pictures. If the picture is rejected, that picture or link will not be published.
How Do We Use Your Information for Advertising and Analytics?
We may allow advertisers and analytics providers to collect your Information within the Service and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect your Information through the use of tracking technologies such as browser cookies and web beacons. The Information collected may be used to offer advertisements of particular interest to you and to analyze your activity within the Service to improve your experience.
When we purchase advertising space on the mobile platform, we share a list of UDIDs and other device ID Information with the ad networks with which we are interacting. Ad networks use this information to match the list of identifiers with identifiers they can confirm have downloaded or installed our Service through an advertisement. When we sell advertising space on the mobile platform, ad networks may collect the following user Information in order to provide advertising of interest to you: IP address, http: header information, location (including longitude/latitude), age, gender and unique device IDs. We do not provide to ad networks names, user names, phone numbers, or email addresses. We also use third parties such as Flurry and MixPanel to collect and analyze your Information. You can opt-out of Flurry Analytics tracking at http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html. We use Google Analytics to track your visits to our websites.
Links to Other Sites
Skout may contain links to other sites and apps, including in advertisements. Any information you provide on those sites is provided directly to the owner of that site and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our privacy policy does not apply to such sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those sites.
What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information?
While we take measures to protect your Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration, despite our efforts, no security measures are impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
