Non-Personal Information
In addition to gathering information through the registration of users, may also monitor the use of our website, services and/or products by collecting aggregate, anonymous, non-personal information.

This information enables us to provide a more enjoyable and personalized experience, as well as tracking errors.
Cookies
Additionally, when you use our products, services or website, we may monitor your use of the website by collecting aggregate information through the use of "cookies".

Users of SKYSCAPE's website, products and/or services may also elect to participate in market research surveys or programs. By submitting answers to these surveys or programs, you are providing specific feedback to us and/or certain third parties (as described below). Participation in a survey or program is voluntary and you have the opportunity to decline participation or honoraria. If you elect to participate in a survey or program, we may disclose your information to certain third parties (as described below), provided you have given us a consent to do so.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may occasionally supplement your information with information we receive from other sources including, but not limited to (a) companies that provide our products or services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website, (b) companies (e.g., pharmaceutical companies) that sponsor surveys or programs on our website (the entities in (a) and (b), collectively, "Partner Companies"), (c) downloadable software applications from our website or (d) professional organizations such as the American Medical Associations, which we will add to the information which we already hold about you.

We use the information we collect to administer our business activities, improve our website, products and services, provide customer service, make available products and services to our users and customers, and for the recruiting, marketing, and other business purposes of SKYSCAPE and our Partner Companies.
Without limiting the foregoing, this information helps us to create your account, verify your identity, verify your eligibility for products and services, deliver interactive educational programs, provide you support, initiate and fulfill orders, complete transactions, and administer the website.
Without limiting the foregoing, we may use your personal information to communicate with you. For example, we may correspond with you, possibly through email, direct mail, fax, or phone calls related to your transactions and orders, participation in our surveys, programs and services, invitations to new surveys or programs and services, deliver information about new surveys, programs or services, and to alert you to developments in the use of pharmaceuticals or selected information from the pharmaceutical industry related to your medical specialty. We use contact and demographic information to offer participation in surveys or programs. We may need to respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of processing or shipping products or services offered through our website. We may also use contact and demographic information to extend offers to you from our Partner Companies.
Disclosing Personal Information
In order to provide you with our website, services, and/or products, we may share your information with our suppliers, agents, contractors, or other service providers ("Service Providers") in connection with the services they perform. Our Service Providers are required not to sell, share, or use your personal information other than to provide the services requested by Company.
We may disclose your personal information to our Partner Companies, who may use this information to provide services requested by SKYSCAPE and/or for their recruiting, marketing or other business purposes.

We do not control the privacy practices of our Partner Companies.
There are specific limited instances when personal information may be shared with accredited Continuing Medical Education ("CME") providers for their fulfillment of their reporting obligations under the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education ("ACCME") and other accrediting bodies. We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties.
We may create aggregate non-personally identifiable information from personal information about our users, sales, products or traffic patterns ("anonymous information"); this anonymous information does not include any personally identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our website, products, surveys and/or services. SKYSCAPE reserves the right to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties in its discretion.
Disclosure by Law
SKYSCAPE may use or disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such use or disclosure is necessary to (a) help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website, (b) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities, (c) to comply with relevant laws, or legal or regulatory obligations, (d) to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on SKYSCAPE, or (e) to protect or defend the rights or property of SKYSCAPE or its customers. Without limiting the foregoing, we may share personal information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.
PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA
SKYSCAPE has a number of security measures in place to help protect and safeguard your personal information from accidental loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or accidental destruction.
Although no web site can guarantee the absolute security of your information, we are committed to taking commercially reasonable precautions as described below.
These procedures include the use of firewalls, secure connections on SKYSCAPE website, and frequently the use of Secured Socket Layers (SSLs) that encrypt pages that collect sensitive information. Personal information is stored in limited access servers and physical access to our servers requires individual authorization and authentication. Only authorized SKYSCAPE employees or contractors carrying out permitted functions are allowed access to personal information. In addition, each employee and contractor of SKYSCAPE is required to sign a confidentiality agreement requiring him or her to keep confidential all personal information of users and customers. We train our employees and contractors on proper use and handling of personal information. Employees and contractors who violate these policies may be subject to disciplinary action, termination of their employment and legal action. Our Service Providers are also required to maintain security measures similar to SKYSCAPE. However, for added protection, we ask that you keep your login information and passwords confidential.
UPDATING YOUR DATA
It is important to us that you are able to take an active role in your experience with us. We highly recommend that you confirm and update your profile regularly. You can update or change your profile, which includes personal information, online at any time. You may request deletion of your personal information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. While updating your profile, you can select the type of messages and communications that you want to receive, which will further customize your experience as described below.
