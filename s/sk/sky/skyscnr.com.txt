Sharing personal data with third parties who process it only under our instruction
We share information relating to our users with selected third parties who provide us with a variety of different services that support the delivery of our services (let's call them "Third Party Processors"). These Third Party Processors range from providers of technical infrastructure to customer service and authentication tools. We require any Third Party Processor which handles information on our behalf to do so pursuant to contractual terms which require that the information is kept secure, is processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws, and used only as we have instructed and not for that Third Party Processor's own purposes (unless you have explicitly consented to them doing so).
Third Party Processors may be located in, or process your information, outside of the country in which you are based. Where our use of a Third Party Processor involves the transfer of personal data from within Europe to a location outside of the European Economic Area, we will put in place appropriate measures to ensure that the personal data is adequately protected in that location, most often by applying European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses alongside robust security checks.
The types of Third Party Processors we may share elements of your personal data with include:
Sharing your information with third parties, or allowing them to collect it, for processing outside of our control
If you are purchasing travel with a Travel Supplier from within our services' booking platform, any personal data you submit as part of the booking process will be shared with the relevant Travel Supplier and/or a third party contracted to provide services on their behalf, in order to enable the booking to processed. When we share your personal data in this way, you'll get an opportunity to review the Travel Supplier's privacy policy and terms and conditions first. Before completing any purchase, we recommend that you carefully review these documents in order to understand how that Travel Supplier will use your information. We may also share personal data with the Travel Supplier for their, or our, standard verification and fraud-detection purposes.
In order to prevent and detect fraud, we may share information about you with the fraud prevention services providers we cooperate with ("Fraud Prevention Providers").
Travel Suppliers and Fraud Prevention Providers may be located in, or process your information, outside of the country in which you are based. For example, if you are booking a flight that operates within a particular country you should expect that your personal information will be transferred to, and be processed by Travel Suppliers that are located in that country. The regulations in these countries may not provide the same level of protection of personal data as the regulations in your own country of residence.
We will share personal data with third parties where you expressly authorise us to, such as where we run a promotion in conjunction with a partner and you instruct us to share your email address with that third party for the purpose of receiving promotional emails.
Publicly accessible personal data included in User Content such as your name, likeness and the content of reviews and posts may be shared and/or made available to carefully selected third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship for the purpose of displaying this content for their similar travel-related services.
We may share and/or make available your publicly accessible personal data such as your name, profile picture, reviews, traveller photos and posts to carefully selected third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship.
Find out more about how you can manage your personal data when it is shared in this way in the What are your choices and rights? section of this policy.
Certain information may also be collected from you by third parties such as advertisers, marketing networks and affiliates (see the How do we advertise? section below) using cookies and similar technologies. For example your IP address and events relating to your activity like searches you have carried out or pages you have viewed on Skyscanner may be collected and transmitted to these third parties to allow them to serve relevant advertising to you across the web. The information that is collected in this way will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. You can find out more about advertising in Skyscanner, including how you can opt out of certain types of advertising in the How do we advertise? section of this policy and in our Cookie Policy.
Disclosing information for legal and other reasons
We may disclose your information where necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, or to a prospective or ultimate buyer if Skyscanner itself (or part of our business) is sold. We may also disclose your information if necessary to prevent, detect or prosecute illegal or suspected illegal activities, including fraud, or to prevent other damage or where necessary in response to legally binding requests, legal action against us, or to enforce our rights and claims.
