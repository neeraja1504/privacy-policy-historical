Our Privacy Policy gives info about how we keep your information safe and secure. It outlines what happens to Cookies on your computer, what info we need from you and how we'll treat it and keep your data secure.
Cookies
Please be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of Cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that store basic information that a web site can use to recognise repeat site visits, e.g. recall your User ID if this has been previously supplied. We may use this to track behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the web sites, target advertising and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.
Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. Note, however, that "personalised" services may be affected if the cookie option is disabled.

By entering your user information, you accept that we may retain your user information and that it may be held by us or any third party company which processes it on our behalf.
We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user's behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various areas of the web site and, in addition, to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or who have clicked on their advertising banners. We will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.

Additional security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your user information.
