Privacy Policy and GDPR - SKT Themes
Our site SKT Themes plans to be fully compliant with GDPR starting 25th May 2018.
What is GDPR?
GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union. Its primary aim is to give control back to the EU residents over their personal data.
Why the urgency? Although the GDPR was introduced two years ago, it becomes  enforceable starting May 25, 2018.
As a customer of SKT Themes GDPR gives you new protection rights and assures better access to your personal data.

Right to portability: Upon request we will export all your data and give it to you for transfer to any third party or competitor.
Right to object: We send monthly newsletters and you can unsubscribe at any point of time from them and also unsubscribe from any of our forum topics or ask us for the same.
Right to access: We are transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.
