DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
(A). Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any SodaStream product including, but not limited to, claims of personal injury and/or property damage, shall be submitted to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance to its then existing Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.   The Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the U.S. Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings relating to this arbitration.
(B). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes.
(C). Any claim shall be brought only in the party's individual capacity, and shall not in any case be brought by the party as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
(D). A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to SodaStream should be addressed to SodaStream's Corporate Office located at 136 Gaither Dr, Ste 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If an agreement to resolve the claim is not reached within 30 days after the Notice is received, any party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by a party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
(E). There shall be one arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.   The arbitrator's award shall be binding on all parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
APPLICABLE LAW
By using any SodaStream product or SodaStream Service you agree that the substantive law of the state of Delaware and applicable federal law will govern in the event of a dispute between you and SodaStream any disputes.
MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY
We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
WAIVER
If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.
If you breach any of the Conditions of Use, and SodaStream elects not to enforces its rights against you, such a waiver by SodaStream shall NOT be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any such breach, or a waiver of any other term, covenant, or SodaStream’s rights as contained herein,

6.  ** ** Legal basis for processing personal data:****
6.1 We will only collect, use or share your personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice where we are satisfied that:
6.1.1 our use of your personal data is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you. For example, in order to provide our product and our services it will be necessary for us to process certain personal data such as your address, phone number, identification data and payment data to create your user account or fulfil your order. Also, we carry out this processing for the purpose of knowing our customer and maintaining our relationship with you, with a view to providing a stellar customer experience; or
6.1.2 our use of your personal data is necessary to support legitimate interests that we have as a business to provide products and services to our customers, provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights.

For this reason, we process personal data such as consumption habits, device information and household composition  and draw insights in relation to possible improvements; or
6.1.3 our use of your personal data is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have. For example, to maintain appropriate business records, to comply with lawful requests by public authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations or as otherwise required by law; or
6.1.4 you have provided your consent to us using your personal data for that purpose (e.g. where you provide us with marketing consents or opt in to additional services).
Where the basis of processing is your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, and therefore prevent that processing, at any time.
7.  ** ** How we protect and store your personal data****
7.1 Data Security
7.1.1 To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Some of the steps we take are: placing confidentiality requirements on our staff and service providers; destroying or permanently anonymising personal data if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. Sodastream will comply with applicable laws in the event of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your personal data and, where we consider appropriate or where required by applicable law, notify you via email, text or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, in so far as it is consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement, or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
7.1.2 However, the security of personal data depends in part on the security of the device used to communicate with us, the security you use to protect your login information, and the security provided by your internet access service provider. We make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of information consistent with this Privacy Notice and all applicable laws and regulations. Where you have a SodaStream username, login or password, you are responsible for keeping this information confidential. We ask you not to share a username, login or password with anyone.
7.2 Data Retention
7.2.1 We may retain your data as long as necessary to provide our products and services, and beyond such time to the extent legally permitted and based on our legal obligations (e.g. in relation to invoice retention) or legitimate interests (eg in retaining data for the purposes of responding to possible disputes or complaints or for possible reactivation of subscriptions).
7.2.2 In addition, we maintain a data retention policy which we apply to information in our care. Where your data is no longer required we will ensure it is securely deleted or anonymised.
7.2.3 Please note that SodaStream may retain applicants personal data submitted to it for no longer than two years after the applied position has been filled or closed.  This is done so we could re-consider applicants for other positions and opportunities at SodaStream; so we could use their information as reference for future applications submitted by them; and in case the applicant is hired, for additional employment and business purposes related to his/her work at SodaStream. If you previously submitted applicants personal data to SodaStream, and now wish to access it, update it or have it deleted from SodaStream's systems, please contact us at privacy@sodastream.com.
8.  ** ** We may share your personal data****
SodaStream may share your personal data with third parties (or otherwise allow them access to it) only in the following manners and instances:
8.1 to other SodaStream affiliates for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Notice.
8.2 with any third parties to whom the relevant SodaStream entity subcontracts all or part of this processing. The purpose of this transfer will be to help manage our business and deliver services.  For instance, we may transfer your personal data to a service provider to the extent necessary to complete an order and deliver your product. Other instances may include transfers to e-marketing service providers, hosting providers and any other relevant roles.  Note that we will never sell your personal data to a third party. These third parties have agreed to confidentiality restrictions and use any personal data we share with them or which they collect on our behalf solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us.
8.3 where permitted by local data protection laws, SodaStream may disclose or otherwise allow others access to your personal data pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you. If warranted, we may also allow access to this information in special emergencies where physical safety is at risk.
8.4 we may disclose any personal data or other information obtained from or about you, to third parties in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, to the extent that this is necessary for the process.
9.  ** ** Transferring personal data globally****
9.1 Your personal data may be transferred and stored outside your place of residence, that are subject to different standards of data protection. In particular, if you live in the EU, you should be aware that your personal data may be shared with, and transferred to, SodaStream affiliates and third-party service providers who are located outside the EU. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal data are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights.  To this end:
9.1.1 we will ensure that transfers within SodaStream and its affiliates will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of SodaStream Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that personal data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Group;
9.1.2 where we transfer your personal data outside SodaStream or to third parties who help provide our products and services, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal data. Some of these assurances are well recognised certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred from within the EU to the United States; or
9.1.3 where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we will carefully validate these requests before personal data is disclosed.
You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal data when this is transferred as mentioned above.

SodaStream uses certain monitoring and tracking technologies (such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags and scripts).  These technologies are used in order to maintain, provide and improve our services on an ongoing basis, and in order to provide our customers with a better experience.  For example, thanks to these technologies, we are able to maintain and keep track of our customers' preferences and authenticated sessions, to better secure our services, to identify technical issues, user trends and effectiveness of campaigns, and to monitor and improve the overall performance of our services.
