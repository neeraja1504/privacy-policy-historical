www.solarreviews.com is a website run by Solar Investments, with the head office based in Lakewood, Colorado.  The way our site works is that consumers who are interested in solar power visit our website to get information about solar power and to request quotes from Installers of solar power systems in their local area that are interested in providing a quote to install a solar power system for the consumer.
Requesting quotes
In order to request a quote from Installers who have registered on our site, you are required to enter some personal information. In most cases, it is basic contact information (your name, address, phone number and email address) to allow Installers to contact you, view your roof online and arrange to give you a quote. We send the quotation request by email to our partner Installers. They are contractually bound to only use your information to establish contact and respond to your request.
Data protection
We take great care in ensuring the security of your personal details. Your information will not be shared with any third parties, other than those Installers we send your quote to. We have both organizational and technical safeguards to protect the security of your personal data whilst it is in our database.
