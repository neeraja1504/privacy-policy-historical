THE SOLESTRUCK PRIVACY NOTICE
Because Solestruck understands that the privacy of your personal information is important to you, we have established privacy policies and practices.

Information We Collect
Personal information is collected when you sign in to Solestruck.com, upon registration with Solestruck, when placing an order, or when contacting us via phone or email. Additional personal identification information such as user name, password, billing information, and contact information may also be collected in order to offer you Solestruck products and services. This information will be used to fulfill your orders, process your transactions, facilitate your use of our website, market our products and services, respond to your requests, assist you with future shopping, and improve Solestruck.com. Choosing not to provide us with information will limit our ability to respond to your shopping needs. In addition, information such as your IP address and the site that referred you to ours will be gathered automatically. All data acquired via the website is stored indefinitely. Because of the nature of the Internet, data may pass through any country and any jurisdiction, including jurisdictions where privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.
Unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials, we may send you information by email or postal mail to the address you provided. From time to time we may notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or other information that may interest you. You may also receive notifications of special promotions, new products, or additional services from our third-party associates. If you would like to opt out of receiving correspondence, please locate the "unsubscribe" link in the small grey text at the footer of our marketing emails or contact  customerservice@solestruck.com  for assistance.
We do not rent or sell your personal information to parties not associated with fulfilling your order, unless sharing this information is necessary to provide you with Solestruck products or is required by law. Solestruck also maintains contracts with third parties for billing, shipping, order processing, and other functions. Solestruck reserves the right to share your information with these third parties, in order to fulfill your order, provide related services, or when it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.
