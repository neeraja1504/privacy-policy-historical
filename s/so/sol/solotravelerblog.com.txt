We never sell or share your personal information with third parties nor do we store any information about your visit to this site other than to analyze and optimize your content and reading experience through the use of cookies.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We do use cookies which, basically, tells the site that you’ve been here before. This affects things like a message you’ll receive on your first visit to the site but not after.
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.
We also use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
