vi.     To provide you with information about products and services we offer that we feel may interest you by post, telephone, email and/or SMS. We will send that information by electronic mail (including email and/or SMS) only if: (i) you have consented to this, for example by opting in at the time you create an account, place an order or complete the email subscription form on our site; or (ii) the information is about our products and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiation of a sale to you and you have not opted out of receiving such marketing messages; or (iii) where we are permitted to do so by law without consent, for example, if you have provided us with a company email address. If you do not want us to use your personal data in this way, please let us know using our contact details at the end of this privacy policy.
vii.    If you have a Facebook account, we may provide you with information about our products and services through Facebook, using Facebook's "Custom Audience" feature. This feature allows us to ensure that you are receiving advertising from us that is most appropriate to you. To do this, we send your email address to Facebook in "hashed" form, which means we convert it into a string of numbers that cannot be reversed to reveal your email address. When Facebook receives the hashed data, it matches it against its own list of hashed data and if it has a hash which corresponds to your email address it will present our advertisement to you. Learn more about Custom Audiences at https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/341425252616329. If you do not wish to receive information about our products and services through Facebook, you can opt out at any time by contacting us using our details at the end of this privacy policy.
Storing Your Personal Data
We will only retain and use your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes set out in this privacy policy or as otherwise required by law.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. We have in place a level of security appropriate to the nature of the information stored and the harm that might result from a breach of security.
Unfortunately the sending of information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be intercepted. We cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically and therefore sending such information is entirely at your own risk.
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to a destination outside the European Economic Area (" EEA "), where it will be stored by us or by one of our suppliers. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such suppliers and staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. We will take reasonable steps to ensure adequate security for any of your information transferred outside the EEA, but please be aware that destinations outside the EEA to which your information may be transferred may have data protection laws which do not offer the same level of protection for your information as those in force in the EEA. By using our site and submitting your information to us, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of such information outside the EEA as set out in this privacy policy. By using the website and submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of such personal information outside the EEA as set out in this privacy policy

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, men in a particular location). We may make use of the information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
