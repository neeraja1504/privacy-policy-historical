DS SolidWorks may also disclose such personal information if required by law or if DS SolidWorks believes in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a warrant, a subpoena, or other court order) or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of DS SolidWorks, our customers, or the public.
If allowed by applicable law, 3DS may also share Your Personal Data with third parties in order to offer You targeted marketing or advertising.
