COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY
1. What are cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technology and how do we use them on the Site?
The Site uses a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a data file that is stored by your Web browser on your computer. Cookies and similar technology are used to help track your clicks and pass information as you navigate the Site. This allows us to make the Site more responsive to your needs by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. We also use a technology known as pixel tags or clear gifs. A pixel tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image stored on webpages or in emails. Pixel tags and similar technology may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies. Pixel tags may also be used to help us confirm your receipt of, and response to, our emails and provide you a more personalized experience with us. The Site also uses cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technology to keep track of how many items you put into your shopping bag and to remember you when you return to the Site. Cookies, pixel tags, and similar technology can allow us to associate navigational information from browsing visits with personal information you provide on our website.
2. Do we share information from cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technology with third parties?
We may share non-transactional website usage data collected on the Site through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technology with other businesses, affiliated companies, and co-brand partners, so that those businesses may send you information about their products or the products and services of their affiliates.
3. How do others use cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technology on the Site?
We carefully select third party analytics and advertising companies and allow them to collect personal identifiers (such as IP address, device id, and cookie information), device characteristics (such as browser version), and website browsing activity from you when you visit the Site and interact with our emails by placing cookies and pixel tags and using other similar technology. These selected companies may use information (which does not include your name, address, credit card/debit card information, email address, or telephone number) about your choice to visit the Site and particular pages on the Site, your interaction with our emails, and your visits to other websites to provide advertisements about Sole Society products and services on the Site and other websites and online services and provide us with information about the use of the Site and our content and advertisements.
We use this information to evaluate the effectiveness of the advertisements they place about our products and services, to educate us on search engine referrals, how you navigate around our website, traffic driven by banner ads, responses to email, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information, and allow us to better serve your interests and provide you with more personalized product offerings.
These companies will use both third party and first party cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technology. Blocking cookies, pixel tags and other similar technology served from third party domains will not block our own use of them.
These companies track the individual visitors to the Site and the activities of those visitors on the Site over time, and they may track those visitors across other websites and online services, if those websites and apps also use the same partners. Currently, Sole Society does not offer the option for its website visitors to make a “Do Not Track” election and does not have the capability to respond to electronic “Do Not Track” signals. Sole Society reserves the right to add such capability to its website at any time in the future and will notify website visitors of this change in capability through an update to this Policy.
