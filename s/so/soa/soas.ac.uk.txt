What personal data do we collect?

When you visit SOAS’s Website, we will automatically receive and store certain types of information on our web servers.
We will keep anonymised details of your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type and operating system. We will also keep a record of the pages you have visited on our Website. Collectively this data is known as “web server logs”.

How is my data used?
We use the personal data collecting through your use of the website for the following purposes:
Administering your request for information about studying at SOAS
Administering your request to attend open days
Processing your online application for short courses and foundation courses
Supporting your application for accommodation to third party providers and intercollegiate halls
To provide you with newsletters, information about events or other content you have asked us to send you
Administering payment of fees for short courses, or discretionary payments such as transcript requests through the online store
Customising future use of the Website
Improving the performance of the Website
SOAS will process the data you provide for enquiries about study or applications to courses in accordance with our Course Enquirers, Applicants or Offer-holders Privacy Notice. We will process data you provide for open days and other events because it is in our mutual interests to stay in touch about arrangements for the event and to record attendance.
When you apply for a short course at SOAS, you will need to provide some personal data to support your application. We will process this data because there is a legitimate interest in the School managing the application efficiently. If you apply and are offered a place on a course, then SOAS will process the personal data because we are taking steps to enter into a contract at your request.
SOAS monitors usage of the website through cookies where this processing is necessary to support the legitimate interests of the School and visitors to the Website, insofar as it enables the School to improve the performance of the Website and optimise the experience for each visitor.
If you opt-in to receiving newsletters or other promotional material by email, post or other means, we process your data you’re your consent. You have the right to object to our processing of the data you provide us with at any time. You will generally be able to exercise this right by unsubscribing from emails or turning off cookies in your browser settings. If you are not able to do so, please contact our Data Protection Officer at dataprotection@soas.ac.uk.
What information do we share, and why?
SOAS will share personal data you provide through your use of the Website with third parties where you have given us your explicit consent, where it is necessary to provide you with a service, or where we are required to do so by law.
For instance, SOAS uses external companies to provide customer relationship management systems for individuals who express an interest in studying at SOAS, and out alumni community. If you provide information through the website, for instance by registering for an open day, your information will be shared with the provider of our student recruitment system to the extent that they are a data processor, which means they will only hold and use the data in accordance with our strict instructions.
Where necessary we could be required by law to share your personal with regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies, or we could be ordered to disclose your personal data by the courts.
Will you share my data internationally?
We will only share your personal data with countries outside the European Economic Area when it is strictly necessary and in accordance with the following legal safeguards:
The transfer is allowed because the country in which the recipient is based has an ‘adequacy decision’ from the European Commission, which means they give equivalent protection to personal data as EU law. This includes US companies certified by Privacy Shield
We have your explicit consent
We use standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer and protect data subjects’ legal rights and access to legal remedies
The transfer is necessary for an important reason of public interest
Third party websites
Some resources provided by SOAS for members of our community link to external websites, who will have their own policies informing you what information will be collected and how and why it will be used.
SOAS encourages you to review the privacy notices of all external websites you choose to link to from the Website so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.
Any third-party sites that you can access through the Website are not covered by SOAS's Website Privacy Notice and we accept no responsibility or liability for these sites.
You do not need to sign in or create a profile to use and navigate SOAS’s Website
