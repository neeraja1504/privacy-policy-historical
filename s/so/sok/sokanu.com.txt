Further, we firmly believe that you own your data, not us. To that end, when you request an account deletion, we will irreversibly delete all personally identifiable information. It is worth noting that currently we delete all data associated with your account , but we reserve the right to maintain anonymized data (such as anonymized responses to our assessment, or anonymized career history) for the purposes of improving our recommendation systems.
Additionally, in the event of a breach where we believe your information has been compromised, we will inform you within 48 hours, letting you know what has happened, what information we believe to have been exposed, what we have done to remedy the situation, and what steps we believe you should take as a precaution.
