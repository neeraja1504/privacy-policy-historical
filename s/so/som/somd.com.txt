They are necessary for the proper operation of many websites. While our site can request a cookie to be created, or request that an existing cookie we created be read, the access to cookie's on your computer is strictly controlled by your web browser. We can not read cookies that were created by other websites and vice versa.
If you configure your system to reject our cookies, you may still use our site. However, your use will be limited in some areas. For example, you will not be able to post in the Community Forums or the classifieds.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, Google ads). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

We use IP addresses to analyze user trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We also use IP addresses to track down abusers of the site, i.e. people who post abusive messages in the forums or announcements. In order to prevent habitual abuse, we may forward a complaint to the owner of the network that the abuser is using. At a minimum, the complaint will include the abusive message(s) in question along with the originating IP address and timestamp.

How We May Contact You
Automatic Mailings:
Whenever you take certain actions on our system, you may receive an automated email from us. Some examples are:
Whenever you register for an account for a service such as the forums or classifieds, you will receive automated email to communicate the status of your account request.
Whenever you request the retrieval of a lost or forgotten username or password, the system will respond with an automated email.
Whenever you subscribe to one or more of our mailing lists, you will receive automated validation messages.
Whenever you make on-line posts using services such as the forums or classifieds, you will received automated emails regarding your posts or subsequent responses.
Account Service:
Once you register for any type of account with us -- such as forums, classifieds or calendar -- we may contact you in regards to your account or to provide information about a new system feature or upgrade. We will not contact you for the sole reason of marketing a third-party service or product.
Information Update Request:
If you are the Point of Contact (POC) for an organization that is listed in our database, we may periodically contact you to request that you review or update your information. We will not contact you for the sole reason of marketing a third-party service or product.
SPAM
The definition of SPAM is vague. The zealots consider SPAM to be any unsolicited email. A more reasonable definition of SPAM is an unsolicited mailing that is often sent in a devious manner for the sole purpose of selling you a third party service or product. We do not engage in SPAMMING. Furthermore, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise share any of our mailing lists with any third party.
SPAMMERS are known to routinely scan websites in order to harvest email addresses that will be added to their mailing lists. When you post information on one of our websites, we take measures to protect your address. However, harvesting techniques are forever becoming more and more devious. As such, we can not guarantee that your email address will never be inadvertently harvested.
We can not protect your address if you post it in plain text. If you post your email address on-line via any of our information sharing services such as the community forums, announcements, or classifieds, there is nothing we can do to protect it. It is extremely likely that it will eventually be harvested by SPAMMERS. If you would like your address to be displayed in plain sight, we recommend that you do one or more of the following:
Disguise the address, i.e. rather than typing bill@domain.com, try bill -AT- domain.com. Most users will know what you mean. Spammers look for anything in the format of name@domain.
Obtain a disposable email address. Once the level of SPAM becomes unbearable, stop using the address and get another one. You can get a free somd.NET address to do the job.
Contact your federal legislators. The CAN-SPAM law is a nice start. But, without aggressive enforcement and prosecutions, the law is meaningless.
Monitoring of User Communications
Throughout somd.com we provide users with facilities they can use to contact other users, advertisers, or local organizations, i.e. online contact forms. Our staff randomly monitors these communications in order to prevent spam, scams, and other potential abuse. We will not share the communications with any third party. If you prefer not to have your communications monitored in this manner, please do not use the online contact forms and instead use any other direct means of contact that may be provided, such as a phone number or direct email address.
