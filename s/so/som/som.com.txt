This privacy policy relates to your use of our website. Please note that our website may link to third party sites (e.g. to Workday – see the 'Sharing Your Information' section below). Please familiarize yourself with the privacy policies that govern your use of such sites to ensure that you understand how your personal data is processed on such sites.
We take your privacy very seriously and we ask that you read this policy carefully as it contains important information on:
•                the personal information we collect about you;
•                what we, and the SOM family of companies, do with your information; and
•                who your information might be shared with.

We collect personal information about you when you contact us via our website.

Our approach to information security
The SOM family of companies have policies and procedures in place to make sure that only authorized personnel can access the information, that information is handled and stored in a secure and sensible manner and all systems that can access the information have the necessary security measures in place. To accomplish this, all employees, contractors and sub-contractors have roles and responsibilities defined in those policies and procedures.
To make sure all of our employees understand these responsibilities they are provided with the necessary training and resources they need. In addition to these operational measures, we also use a range of technologies and security systems to reinforce the policies.  Audits to identify areas of non-compliance are routinely scheduled. Additionally, all areas of the organization are regularly monitored and measured to identify problems and issues before they arise.
The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is possible that we might be forced to disclose your personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith such disclosure is required by law, such as in response to a court order, a law enforcement agency request, in response to a subpoena, or in response to an administrative agency's request.
