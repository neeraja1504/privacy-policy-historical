This includes training our employees in their obligation to comply with data privacy guidelines (customer services are exclusively implemented by Sounds.com employees), as well as procedural and digital security measures related to the processing of your data.
In the following section we will provide information about the methods, purpose and scope of the data processing which takes place when you visit our website.
We continuously strive to help you with any questions you may have regarding data processing issues relevant to our services. If you have any questions, please contact the department responsible for data processing:

1.Personal Data
The following information relates to the processing of your personal data. Personal data refers to all data which refers to you personally, i.e., name, address, email address, payment information or your activities as a user.
2.Data Capture Every Time You Access the Website
2.1Usage Data
Every time you access the website, even if it is only to look for information and you do not log in or register a customer or otherwise deliberately transfer information (for example by signing up for a newsletter), we will capture the following data, transmitted by your browser, which allow you to visit the website (usage data):
IP address
Date and time of the request
Duration of the visit to the website
Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Contents of request (actual page)
Access status/HTTP-status code
Respectively transmitted data quantities
Which website the request is coming from
Browser, browser language, browser software version
Operating system
For IT security reasons, we will save your IP address in our IT system log files for 7 days following your website visit in order to recognize and prevent (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks. After the 7 days have passed your IP address will be anonymized by removing the last 8 bits.
If your IP address is saved in unabbreviated format, we will only aggregate it with any of the usage data mentioned above if we have a legitimate interest.
2.2Cookies
When using our website as well as our online services, cookies are saved on the device you use to access the page. They enable the Sounds.com systems to recognize your browser and to provide services which are of interest to you personally.
Cookies are small text files (alphanumeric identification symbols) which are stored on users’ end devices when they visit a website. When the same website is visited again, the information which was saved will then be sent back to the participating server. We use first-party cookies and third-party cookies, which can be designed as session cookies or temporary cookies.
Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive after your browser session. These cookies store a so-called session ID, which is assigned various requests from your browser during a shared session. This type of cookie is used in relation to user and license data. Its use is technically required in order to be able to connect your user account with your actions over separate visits.
Third-party cookies are only set by servers if they are not identical with our servers, i.e. if they come from other websites you have visited. In contrast, first-party cookies on browsers are not accessible across domains. Third-party cookies are used when using our website and our online services by some third-party companies (for further details about some selected providers used by us, see below under c)). By using these third-party cookies, also known as “tracking cookies”, a user’s visits to various websites can be assigned to the specific visitor. This allows us to draw conclusions about the visitor’s interests and to accordingly customize websites.
You also have the option of configuring your browser so that specific types of cookies are not allowed or deleted. You can also visit our website if your browser settings block the placing of cookies or if you do not agree with having cookies placed on your hard drive. We would like to inform you, however, that if you do so, you may not be able to fully use all features on our website.
2.3Third-Party Providers
2.3.1Google Analytics
As a part of our internet presence we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis tool provided by Google Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze how our website is used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website, including the abbreviated IP address, is transferred to and stored on a Google server, in some cases located in the USA. The evaluation by Google is exclusively carried out in an anonymous process in which the code expansion provided by Google
"anonymizeIp"
deletes the last 8 bits of your IP address, therefore anonymizing it for subsequent data processing.
If you have registered a user account with us, we will additionally use a so-called
"User ID"
for this service. This is a unique, permanent and personalized symbol sequence we assign to you when you first log in to your user account. When you visit the website and are logged in to your user account, the website activities are assigned to your permanent user ID. This ID is not assigned to a specific end device (smartphone, laptop, etc.), but to you personally. In conjunction with Google Universal Analytics, this User ID is transmitted to Google, where it is used by us at Google as a pseudonym for you as a user. The data accumulated by Google are therefore anonymized for Google, as the service does not have the option to create a link to your user account and therefore to your personal data.
Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for us as website operators, and providing other services related to website activity and internet usage. Where applicable, Google will transmit this information to third parties if this is prescribed by law, or as long as these third parties process these data on behalf of Google.
If, however, you still wish to prevent the use of Google Analytics, you can install the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics. You can find it at:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
As mentioned above, you can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software settings accordingly. We would like to inform you, however, that if you do this you may not be able to fully use all the functions on this website.

2.3.2Heap Analytics
This website uses Heap Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Heap Inc., 460 Bryant St., Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Heap”). Heap uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Heap server in the USA and stored there. However, if the IP anonymization is enabled on this website, your IP address will be previously shortened by Heap within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the European Economic Area Agreement. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address is transferred to a Heap server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of our customer service, Heap will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing our customer service with other services relating to website and internet use.
2.3.3Zendesk
In order to process submitted requests, especially those directed to our customer service team (“Customer Support”), we use the helpdesk system Zendesk. The according functions are supplied by Zendesk, Inc., 989 Market Street #300, San Francisco, CA 94102, USA, who have concluded an order data processing agreement.
As part of customer support, the following data are saved in Zendesk to enable order processing: Name, email address, telephone number, postal code, city and country. In case of questions regarding the implementation of hardware repairs, complete customer postal addresses are saved in individual cases if this is necessary to process the repairs.
2.4Retargeting
Retargeting is a variant of online targeting in which users of an online service are marked by suppliers via the retargeting function. This function serves to present visitors to a website with interest-based advertisements as part of the advertising networks. In order to do this, your browser stores cookies which make it possible to recognize you as a visitor when you access websites which belong to the corresponding supplier’s advertising network. These pages display advertisements for products based on your previous internet activity, including products in which you have shown an interest on other websites which use the corresponding provider’s remarketing function.
On our website we mainly use retargeting services from the following suppliers:
2.4.1Facebook
Sounds.com uses plug-ins of the social network Facebook (www.facebook.com). The plug-ins are marked with a company logo of Facebook or the additional
"Facebook Social Plug-in"
. When you access website from us, which contains such a plug-in, a connection to servers through the browser of Facebook is set up. By integrating of the plug-in, Facebook receives the information that you have visited our website. As long as you long as you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to the site to your Facebook account. The plug-in transmits any actions you perform via the plug-in, e.g. pressing the “Like”-Button, directly on to Facebook, and these data will be stored there.
For the purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and use of data by Facebook, and your rights and settings taken to protect your privacy, please see the respective privacy notices from Facebook.
To prevent such a collection of data through Facebook, you must log out on Facebook before visiting our website.
If you don’t wish to use Facebook’s retargeting function, then you can generally deactivate it via your Facebook account
https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen
2.4.2Google Remarketing
According to the company’s own information, Google does not capture any personal data during this process. If you don’t wish to use Google’s retargeting function, then you can generally deactivate it by selecting the according settings under
https://adssettings.google.com/
Alternatively, you can deactivate the use of cookies for interest-based advertising by following the instructions of the Opt out page of the Network Advertising Initiative at
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/
