7. Why are we allowed to process personal data?
7.1 For it to be permissible for us to process personal data there must always be support for said treatment within the GDPR, so-called lawful basis. Such lawful basis may include:

Fulfilling a legal obligation, for example storing certain information due to legislation regarding certain accounting standards and practices. This could also be the case when handling opt-out settings requests concerning your rights as a Data Subject in accordance with GDPR.
A weighing of interests when we have a legitimate interest in using your data, for example for statistical purposes and to market our services, and to secure payment and prevent fraud.
7.2 It may occur that the same personal data is processed both through support in terms of fulfilling an agreement as well as in terms of specific consent or in terms of the processing of that specific information is necessary to fulfill other legal obligations. This means that even though you may revoke your consent and the treatment based on said consent ceases, that specific personal data may remain with us for separate reasons.
