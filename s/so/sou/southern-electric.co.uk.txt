6. Automated decision-making
6.1
We use automated decision-making in the following ways:
(a) Determining your Home Services cover renewal price
We use an automated calculation to enable us to make a fair and responsible decision on what pricing we can offer you based on the cost of maintaining your boiler. We will consider:
your boiler make and model;
the length of time you have had cover;
your geographical location;
your claims history; and
whether non-standard system parts are required (including thermal store and unvented cylinders).
If your boiler is considered to be non-standard by SSE and/or you have made a claim against your product and/or you live in an area where we have a higher cost to serve your individual renewal price may increase.
(b) Credit Vetting
We use automated credit scoring assessments to determine the suitability for you to take any product or service on a credit basis. We may consider:
Data included in your application for a new product or service;
Data that we already retain on you such as payment history for existing products and services, including data from accounts where you are named jointly with one or more additional account holder;
Information from one or more credit reference agency; and/or
Where appropriate, data from fraud prevention agencies.
If we decide that offering unsecured credit is not appropriate, we may require energy customers to pay a security deposit, or pay through a pre-payment meter or a smart meter operating in pre-payment mode. We may ask you for payment security at any time should we determine that unsecured credit is no longer appropriate for you.
For non-energy products such as telephone or broadband, where we determine that credit is not appropriate we may decide not to continue with your application. We will write to you to inform you of this decision.
(c) Warm Home Discount
Where applications are made online, and to speed up the processing of paper application forms, we use an automated process to verify eligibility for Broader Group Warm Home Discount rebates. This means our computer system will match the benefits you have ticked on your application to check whether you meet the criteria required to receive the rebate. The criteria are described within the online journey, and on the paper application form.
6.2 You can appeal any automated decision, receive an explanation of the decision or require human review of the decision by contacting us using the details in section 12.
7. Who do we share your personal information with?
We will share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:
(a) our third party suppliers, partners and sub-contractors that provide, review and/or receive services in relation to our website, services and/or products, which include: payment processors; suppliers of technical, support and installation services; insurers; logistics providers; call centre service providers; security providers; cloud services providers; research agencies; and, if you are entitled to claim government funding for energy efficiency measures, installers, energy performance assessors and sales advisers.

(e) other energy suppliers – if you choose to leave us, we’ll share your information with the other suppliers to assist the switching process, including energy usage and any debts on the account. We may also share your personal information where they carry out services for us, e.g. if they carry out meter readings at your property for us;

(g) if you are a Phone and/or Broadband customer we will share your data with Vodafone who is our current phone line and broadband supplier. Vodafone is responsible for the personal data that is collected when you use these services, including how it is used. Vodafone will handle your personal information when it is providing SSE Phone and Broadband services as set out in Vodafone’s Privacy Policy;
(h) companies or partner organisations which provide services in relation to, or use information as part of, market research;
(i) third parties that help us with advertising and marketing. For example, we share limited personal information with the following third parties who serve advertising on their platforms on our behalf: Amazon, Viant, Facebook and Google Adwords;

(ii) protect the rights, property or safety of SSE, our staff, customers or others.
(p) credit reference agencies
Where it is necessary to credit check you, we will supply your personal information to credit reference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as about your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an on-going basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs will share your information with other organisations. The identities of the CRAs, and the ways in which they use and share personal information, are explained in more detail on the Experian website.
(q) fraud prevention agencies
(i) To help us identify fraud and energy theft, we will give details of your account to fraud prevention agencies who will use the information to check public and other databases they hold and may provide information to us to help identify fraud and energy theft. Checks will be performed on a regular basis whilst you hold an account with us.
(ii) If we suspect or can confirm theft of energy has occurred, a record will be kept by fraud prevention agencies which may include sensitive information about alleged criminal offences. The fraud prevention agencies may provide the information to other energy companies to help identify fraud and detect energy theft but only in limited circumstances where you have accounts with them. Where theft has been identified, your account terms may change, but we will notify you separately if this is the case.
(r) for FIT customers, we will share information with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Central FIT Register where requested.
8. How is your personal information transferred outside of the EEA?
8.1
We, or a third party who we share personal information with, may host, store and handle that personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
8.2
We will only permit this to happen if adequate safeguards have been put in place to protect your personal information.
This means that we will:
(a) ensure that the country in which your personal information will be handled has been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);
(b) include standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission for transferring personal information outside the EEA into our contracts with those third parties (these are the clauses approved under Article 46.2 of the GDPR); or
(c) (in the case of transfers from the EEA to the USA), ensure that the recipient of the personal information has certified with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework, as permitted by Article 46.2 of the GPDR.
9. How long do we hold your personal information?
9.1
We keep your personal information for no longer than is necessary of the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The length of time we retain it for depends on the purposes for which we use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
9.2
This means that some of your personal information will be kept for a short time e.g. we may keep copies of correspondence and complaints for up to three years following resolution. Other information may be kept for a longer period of time, e.g. we keep details of your address for a period of up to six years after your account has settled (but for a shorter period if that is possible).
