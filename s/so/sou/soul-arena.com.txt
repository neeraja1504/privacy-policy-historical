Children's Privacy
Soul-Arena does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. We make reasonable efforts to prevent someone who is underage from joining as a member of Soul-Arena, and will not collect information from them. If Soul-Arena learns that a child under the age of 13 has become a member, we will close that child's account and delete any information collected about the child.
