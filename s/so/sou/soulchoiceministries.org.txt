Privacy Policy | Soul Choice Ministries
Our Commitment to Your Privacy
This site is owned and operated by Soul Choice Ministries. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Soul Choice Ministries, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
The Information We Collect:
When you place an order or participate in activities on Soul Choice Ministries’ website, you provide certain personally identifiable information (PII). Examples of this information may be any of the following: your name, e-mail address, personal address, personal phone number, credit card information, personal demographic information, personal shopping, contact preferences, and personal and/or professional opinions.
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself to fill and ship any orders that you place. If you pay with a credit card, we send only what is required to a third-party financial institution to verify your card and process the transaction. We may use your sales and account information to send you notices of products or services that you might be interested in, or to offer specials from time to time. If you do not wish to receive that type of information, you may indicate this in your account management page. We review the site traffic information to learn which area of the site is helpful for our customers and which are not. This helps us make improvements to the site.
Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Our site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt any passwords and credit card information that you enter. SSL secures your data while it travels from your computer to ours.
Children
Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. Kids, please, be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else online or over the Internet.
