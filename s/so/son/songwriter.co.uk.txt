THE PRIVACY OF NON-MEMBERS
The International Songwriters Association always tries to respond to queries from the general public (in other words non-members) who request advice or assistance, or who simply wish to comment on songwriting in general.

(b) any request contained in that communication has been acted upon, unless there is a continuing need to retain it for the purposes of ongoing correspondence. (For example, if you send us a query, and we require further information from you in order to answer that query, we may hold the original email or letter until such time as the extra information can be added to it to enable us to respond.)
Accordingly, every communication from a non-member which requires a follow-up response from the ISA, should be accompanied on each separate occasion by an email or postal address or telephone number, as the ISA will not have automatically gathered or stored such information from a previous communication.
