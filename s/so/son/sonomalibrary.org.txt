Your Library card number and account
Some of the databases available to you from our web site will require the bar code number from your Sonoma County Library card for verification purposes. These database vendors do not have access to our records.
You can log onto your account on our catalog using the My Account tab. To prevent others from viewing your account, do not share your library card number.
Your account in the system contains information about current hold requests, items checked out, items overdue, and fines. Once items are returned and fines are paid, this information is removed from your account. The library does not keep a history of previous books checked out on your account.
Searches in this web site are not tracked against your library account. All web site usage information is logged separately from your library account information.
If you create an account in one of our databases, for example to receive email updates of new magazine articles, the account has no connection with your Library card number and account. Please review the privacy policy of the database site you visit.
Online payments
If you choose to use our Pay Online service to pay fines or fees with a credit or debit card, we will need both your library account information and your credit card information. Your library account information is used only by us, to credit your payment to the correct library patron account. We provide your credit/debit card information to a payment processing service. The service uses this information only to process your payment. We do not provide your library account information to the service.
Children's Information
We do not collect any information about children other than the information needed for a library card.
