Cing, LLC ("Cing", "we" or "us") is determined to protecting your online privacy. This Cing privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through the Cing website (collectively, the "Website" located at www.cing.com).
1. User Consent.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or otherwise using the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and Cing's Terms of Use (available at http://www.cing.com/page/terms_conditions).
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.
2. Collection of Information.
Personally Identifiable Information.
We generally collect any information voluntarily submitted by you ("Personally Identifiable Information") through Cing. This Personally Identifiable Information is what we use to specifically identify you and it includes your name, e-mail address, user ID, and other non-public information. For example, when you register for an account ("User Account") with Cing, make a purchase, post a review, send feedback, request information, or otherwise request or submit content through Cing ("Cing Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information such as your full name, mailing address, a valid email address, telephone number, date of birth and a password of your choice. If you place an order, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
Some information we ask you to provide is labeled as required while you may provide other information voluntarily. Engaging in a Cing Activity is voluntary, but if the requested mandatory information is not provided for a specific Cing Activity, you will not be permitted to participate in that activity.
When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on Cing, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, your email address and other related information will be collected in order for Cing to contact you.
We may also collect information about you and your friends who use Cing, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through Cing in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections.
If you decide to use our referral service or buy a gift for someone other than yourself, we will ask for your friend's name and email address. Your friend will be sent a one-time email with the gift that you have purchased or an invitation to visit Cing. This information will be stored by Cing for the purpose of sending this email, sending the gift, and tracking the referral program.
We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with, or other third parties. We may use this information with other Personal Information we have collected about you.
If you send an email to us, or provide us with any other feedback, we will collect your email address and the full content of your email, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may, with your consent, use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Cing or the social network from which you have connected to Cing. We will use your email address to contact you on behalf of any of your friends or to provide you with notifications which you have requested to receive.
We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that is collected that does not specifically identify you. As you use Cing, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, including things like your Internet protocol ("IP") address, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using, your location and information on which of the advertisements displayed on Cing you clicked on. This information will be used to customize your experience on Cing and make it a more personal experience. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information will also be used to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third parties to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.
3. Use of Information.
Generally, the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us is used to provide you access to Cing, to improve Cing, to customize Cing, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. We do share your content preferences and other information with the social network with which you have connected to Cing, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties.
Information Shared With Merchants.
We will automatically send to merchants ("Merchants") the email addresses of those customers who purchase one of their deals from Cing. There may be times when certain Merchants ask for certain other information about the Cing customers who purchase the offer provided on Cing. In such a case, we will provide the Merchant with some of your Personally Identifiable Information, but this information will only be provided to the Merchant who has requested for it for that specific offer. We disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of that specific Merchant. The Merchant will be informed that this information is to be used solely for communication purposes related to the specific promotion on Cing, but Cing will not claim responsibility for Merchant's actions. Merchant's actions are not in the control of Cing.
Authorized Third Party Service Providers.
We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to third party service providers ("Third Party Service Providers") who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Cing and to help us communicate with you. These Third Party Service Providers perform services such as sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), providing customer service, fulfilling orders, delivering packages, administering contests or sweepstakes, providing search results and links, and operating the Website. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks.
We require our Third Party Service Providers to promise not to use your Personally Identifiable Information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by Cing Merchants and Third Party Service Providers is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
Business Transfer.
In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you Personally Identifiable Information may be an asset which is transferred. You acknowledge and agree that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy. However, the Personally Identifiable Information would still be subject to this Privacy Policy following the business transfer.

c. Enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms and Conditions or other agreements; or
d. To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Website, its Users or other third parties.
We may also share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information with Cing affiliated companies ("Affiliates") that are under a common control. If such information is shared with Affiliates, then the Affiliates are required to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.
You hereby consent to us sharing your Personally Identifiable Information under the circumstances described herein.
We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our partners, Affiliates, and any third party advertising companies ("Third Party Advertising Companies") we use.
We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable statistical information regarding your use in order for us to continue to make improvements to our Website.
