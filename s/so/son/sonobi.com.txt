3. Legal basis for use of your personal information
Legal bases
We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this privacy policy are as follows:
To perform our obligations. Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of use of our website which you accept by browsing our website); or
To comply with our legal obligations. Our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations (for example, for tax regulation purposes); or

For internal administrative purposes.
We have carried out a balancing test and we believe that we have a legitimate business interest to use and share your personal data (in compliance with this privacy policy and subject to your various rights as set out in this privacy policy) and that our legitimate interest is not detrimental to you.
If we rely on our (or another person’s) legitimate interests for using your personal information in the future, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.  You can ask us for information on this balancing test by emailing us at privacy@sonobi.com.
For marketing purposes
We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described below).
