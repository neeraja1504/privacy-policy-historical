APPENDIX 1
Sonesta Privacy Notice EEA Disclosures
These disclosures (the “ Disclosures ”) supplement the Sonesta Privacy Notice.
The Disclosures apply only to our processing of personal data within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”) from one or more of the European Union Member States plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (together known as the “ European Economic Area ” or “ EEA ”) or the UK, in the event that the UK no longer forms part of the European Union or the EEA.
Data Retention
1. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in the Sonesta Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
2. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services)
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them)
Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations)
International Transfers
We are an international company and we may, subject to applicable law, transfer your information, to our affiliates or selected third parties outside the country where you are located and where information protection standards may differ (e.g., your information may be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions).  We will utilize appropriate safeguards governing the transfer and usage of your personal data, such as an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Model Clauses or other applicable adequacy mechanisms.  If you would like further detail on the safeguards we have in place you can contact us directly as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.
Security
We seek to take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  We have implemented physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.  Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure, thus we cannot guarantee the security of all information you provide to us via the Services.
Data Subject Rights
Individuals whose personal data we process subject to the GDPR have certain rights, where applicable, as required by law, including the right of access, erasure and data portability, as well as the right to rectification, to restrict processing, to withdraw consent, and to object to processing as follows.

3.

4. Objection – Individuals have the right to object to our processing of their personal data where we are relying on legitimate interests as our legal basis and their rights override our legitimate interests in processing their personal data.  Individuals also have the right to object to our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.
Withdrawal of Consent – Where we rely on consent as the basis for processing personal data, individuals have the right to withdraw their consent.
6. Erasure – Individuals have the right to request deletion or erasure of their personal data in a number of circumstances where required by law.  These include where we no longer require the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected, the individual has withdrawn consent or, where we are relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis, and the individual’s rights override our legitimate interests.
7. Portability – Individuals have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you in a structured machine-readable format and to have it transmitted to another controller.  This right only occurs where we are relying on your consent or performance of a contract as our legal basis and the processing is carried out automatically.

We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns directly if possible, and ask you to please contact us in the first instance.
