4. Antispam Policy
Newsletter Subscriber
A user is added to our Newsletter Subscribers database when he/she subscribes to the newsletter, either by entering the email address in the subscribe box on all our pages, or by opting in at the checkout stage for any of our digital products. The process is a double opt-in, with an email containing a confirmation link which must be clicked in order to continue the signup process. An unsubscribe link is included in all communications.
What Is Spam?
Spam is unsolicited email also known as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE). It involves emails sent to users who:
Have no association with the sender
Have registered an account but not opted in to receive commercial emails
Have previously opted in but then opted out of receiving commercial emails
Email Communications
Sonicstate does  not send spam. Our emails are sent to inform subscribers of new content we post, products we sell and other related information.  Our Newsletters include the links to our news articles and videos, information about promotions and latest news from our industry.
We cooperate with other businesses that target similar audiences as ours - they send our newsletters to their opted-in subscriber base. We are very careful about the antispam practices of these businesses and never cooperate with companies that are outside the scope of our audience or our industry or which have an unclear Antispam Policy. On rare occasions we also send selected partners’ emails to our subscriber base.
We do not sell or distribute (for financial gain or for free) or otherwise disclose any partner or customer e-mail addresses to any third parties except when legally required.
Every newsletter contains an Unsubscribe link at the top of the message.
Necessary Communication
There are situations which require us to send you emails. These include:
Sending a message to your emailbox with the link to activate your subscription to our newsletter at Sonicstate.com
Sending you invoices or links for product downloads for each completed transaction on our website.
Sending you emails concerning technical, legal and support matters.
Please make sure you do not flag Sonicstate  as ‘Spam’ or ‘Unsolicited’ in your email application. When you register and do not find an activation email in your inbox, check your spam folder.
When you get in contact with us (for example by email or via a form on the website) we will keep records of what is communicated.  This is to ensure we have a record of our discussion for future reference and so we can improve the website.
