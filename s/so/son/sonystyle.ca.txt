In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.
If you post information on a third party platform that refers to Sony Canada or the Sony Canada Properties (e.g., by using a Twitter hashtag associated with Sony Canada in your tweet), your post, user name and/or profile picture associated with the applicable social media account may be published on the Sony Canada Properties in accordance with the terms of that third party.
