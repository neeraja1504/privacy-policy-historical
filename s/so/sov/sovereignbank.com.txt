Privacy Policy - Santander
This Privacy Notice, effective October 17, 2013, is being provided to you to describe what Santander Bank, N.

This Notice also covers divisions of Santander Bank, such as Nantucket Bank and Bank of Martha’s Vineyard.
What does Santander do with your personal information?
WHY?
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:
Social Security number and income

NOTE: We may disclose all the kinds of information described in this section to companies we hire to perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, such as insurance companies and brokerage firms.
