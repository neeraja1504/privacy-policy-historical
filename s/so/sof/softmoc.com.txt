Statistics about your visit.
As you browse the site, SoftMoc.com web servers and select 3rd party analytics providers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our site
Which pages people visit on our site
From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "mindspring.net" or "aol.com")
Which browsers people use to visit our site
While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.
Ad networks, including Google, may show you ads on sites on the internet based on your browser cookies and your visit history on our website. These ads are based on your anonymous browsing patterns & interests, not your personally identifiable information. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks.
Your personal information you submit is never shared with any third parties unless it is necessary to complete your request.
SoftMoc's checkout portion of its web site is on a SECURE SSL SERVER to ensure the security of your internet transactions. That means all information that you send through the Internet is ENCRYPTED and cannot be read by a outside third party. If you choose to pay by credit card we require you to enter your credit card number each time you place a order, since we don't store your number on our site. Your credit card information is only used to process your order. We believe this provides you with the most secure shopping environment.
SSL is a security protocol developed by Netscape Communications to compensate for the lack of data protection on the Internet.
SSL will allow you to send and receive encrypted information to and from SoftMoc. This means that any information sent from your computer to SoftMoc via an SSL capable browser (Netscape), will be completely encrypted. While information may travel across 20 networks, nobody will be able to decrypt data that is being sent or received.
As long as the web browser you're using supports SSL, such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer and AOL browsers, you can rest assured that your information will be submitted to our server with a high level of security.
Netscape Navigator identifies secure documents in several ways:
In the location field, if the URL begins with https, rather than http, the documents comes from a secure server.
If the door key icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen displays on a blue background, your transactions will be secure.
The color bar across the top of the content area will similarly display as blue (for secure) and gray (for insecure).
Users will always be warned if a secure URL has been re-directed to an insecure location.
What will my information be used for?
All transactions that you initiate with SoftMoc on this web site are confidential. Your name will not be added to any mailing list and will NEVER be transferred to a third party.
WE PROMISE.
