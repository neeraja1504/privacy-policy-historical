SoftwareMedia.com Values Your Privacy and Security
Your Privacy
Have you ever wondered how "Prescription World" got your email address and "Mortgage Express" got your mailing address? Well we can tell you it wasn't from us. We are 100% committed to protecting your right to privacy.
On pages throughout SoftwareMedia.com, you may be asked to submit private, personal information such as Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Number and Credit or Debit Card Information. We use this information to process, ship, track and complete your order. We use contact information to communicate with you throughout the order process. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We will never use your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

You can access and update all of your information that we collect and maintain by clicking the "my account" button at the top of the page. You may log into your account with the email address and password you selected when you created the account. If you did not create an account but you require a correction of information, you may contact customer service at any time.
Our Commitment to Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
