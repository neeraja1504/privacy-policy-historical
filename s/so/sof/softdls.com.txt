Security.
We try not to collect information about children under the age of 13, but sometimes it's very difficult to make sure that the person who is providing the information is above 13, that's why we encourage parents and guardians to visit the websites that their children visit. The means with which website operators collect and use the personal information of children under 13 is regulated by The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and it's followed by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (the "Act"). For more information about the Act and children's on-line privacy in general you can visit the FTC's web site at www.ftc.gov/privacy and for safety tips on privacy visit www.OnGuardOnline.gov.
