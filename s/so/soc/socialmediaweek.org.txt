Our Site may contain links to Internet sites or third party applications or widgets operated by other companies that we don’t own or control. These links might have been added by us or by a User, such as in a submitted comment. Regardless of who added a given link, we’re not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties. Once you leave the Site via such a link or access a third party application or widget, you should check the applicable privacy policy of that third party to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

We use the third party provider DISQUS in order to allow you to comment on our Site by using your pre-existing Twitter or Facebook accounts.  Despite certain DISQUS communications to the contrary, we do not get access to your email address nor do we have any access to or control over your personal data or private information when you use your Twitter or Facebook account to comment on the Site.

What about cookies?
Cookies are small bits of information that we might place on your computer. We would use cookies to identify your Internet browser, store Users’ preferences, and determine whether you have installed sufficient enabling software needed to access certain parts of the Service. Data in cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide features of the Service.

How do I edit my personal information?
Click “Edit Profile” to edit your personal information.  While most of the information in your profile can be edited, many of the fields are required in order to complete the modification to your profile.  Also please note that you cannot change your username.
How do I delete my Membership account?
If you would like to delete your Membership account, please send us an email from the email address that is associated with your Membership account at info@socialmediaweek.org.  Please let us know your username in that email, so that we may complete your request accurately.
You should be aware that it may not be technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our servers. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your PII may exist in a non-erasable form that may be difficult or impossible for us to locate.
In addition, we have the right to delete any account at any time if required to do so by process of law, or if necessary in order to investigate fraud, a violation of our Terms of Use or in connection with any harm being caused to a third party or their rights.
How secure is my personal information?
We use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  However, we cannot completely guarantee the security of PII. Although we make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your PII from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.
We don’t collect or retain your personal financial information (“PFI”), such as credit card data.  If in the future we offer services that require you to provide your PFI, your PFI will be collected by, provided to and processed by a third party payment processor – not us – and their treatment of your PFI will be covered by their privacy policy.
