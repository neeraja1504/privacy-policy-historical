In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information about the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website. We only use such data in aggregated form and do not identify you individually. This collected data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site for your use.
IP Address
We may collect and track traffic by IP address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you use your browser on the internet.

By submitting your information to us you consent to this transfer.
