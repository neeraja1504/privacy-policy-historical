2.  ** Overview**
SocialFlow owns and operates the SocialFlow and Trib.alwebsites (the “ Sites” ). The Sites, together with the content and tools available there, are collectively referred to as the Services.  Our Services enable our Customers to post content such as a news story, a picture and/or a video (“SocialFlow Customer Posts”) onto social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and to better understand how such SocialFlow Customer Posts are interacted with by Users (defined below). Individuals, who visit one or both of these Sites or use the Services, by clicking on or otherwise interacting with a link operated by Trib.al, are referred to as Users.
This policy explains how SocialFlow may collect, use and disseminate information obtained from Users of the Sites and Services. This Privacy Policy applies to the practices of SocialFlow, and does not apply to other businesses that SocialFlow does not own or control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party services you access.
SocialFlow has identified four primary types of Users, based on how they use the Sites and Services. Note that an individual may fall into more than one category.
Users Who Visit SocialFlow. These individuals typically visit our Sites to learn more about SocialFlow’s products or services.
Users Who Click on Trib.al Links. These individuals click on a Trib.al, or Trib.al-managed link to SocialFlow Customer Posts they see in their social feed on a social networking platform like Twitter or Facebook or elsewhere on the internet.
Users Who Interact With Social Posts. These individuals like, comment, share, or take another social action on  SocialFlow Customer Posts they see inside a social networking platform like Twitter or Facebook.
Employees of SocialFlow Customers. These individuals use SocialFlow’s Services as part of their job function.
The Collection, Use, and Sharing of information for each of these types of Users are covered in the sections below.
*3. Different Types of Users*
*a. Users Who Visit SocialFlow Sites*
Collection of Information:   SocialFlow collects general information about a User’s visit to a website where our Services are enabled (such as, time, date and the URL of the website).  SocialFlow may also collect more specific information about the User and use of the Service, such as demographic data, profile data and frequency or duration of use.Collecting such data (Traffic Data) may entail the use of software programs, cookies, IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.
Use of Information:   SocialFlow uses this data to help diagnose problems with its web servers, to administer the Site and Services and to analyze User trends and behaviors. User IP addresses are logged for identity verification and automated anti-fraud purposes. SocialFlow may use email addresses gathered from the Sites to communicate pertinent offering updates and announcements to people who have expressed interest in the products via the Sites.
Sharing of Information: We may enable companies to pixel our Sites for advertising and retargeting purposes. Other than that, SocialFlow does not share information with any third party for these Users except for our third-party agents who are contractually required to only use data as directed by SocialFlow.
EU Countries : The legal basis for placing non-necessary cookies and processing pseudonymous cookie IDs is consent upon first visit to the Sites.
