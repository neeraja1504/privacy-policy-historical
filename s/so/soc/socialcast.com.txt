Children Under the Age of 13
The Company cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be "bumped-out" of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Upon registration with the Company, a user profile is developed to further customize the user's experience. We collect the following personal information from you:
Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, Company Name
Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password
Once you use the service, we may also collect other information from you, if you provide such information while using the service. The information may include, but is not limited to:
Demographic information such as age, education, job title, business unit, department, start date, usernames, application usage, gender, location, interests and zip code. Because user privacy is important to us, access to the raw user data is restricted within the Company to our data scientists and authorized employees. After the data is scrubbed of personally identifiable information, we use this information internally to analyze general usage patterns and determine how users are using different aspects of the service in order to improve it and provide a better experience to our members.
As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.
We use this information to:
Send you product, service, and new feature information
Respond to customer service requests
Respond to requests for pricing information
