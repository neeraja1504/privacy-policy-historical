SocialVibe
Last updated November 3, 2010
Your privacy is important to SocialVibe (“SocialVibe” or “Service”) and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed various measures to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your Personally Identifying Information, which refers to information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate an individual or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual (i.e., physical address, email address, first and last name) (“PII”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at privacy@socialvibe.com.
What We Collect
We may be able to collect information from social networking systems on which you have used Zynga Games, Facebook, or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.
When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information, namely, PII or NPII as defined below, that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.
Note that since most SocialVibe Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, their Privacy Policy prior to continuing.
SocialVibe’s site may contain links to other websites; these links are provided solely for your convenience. Links taken to other sites are done so at your own risk and SocialVibe accepts no liability for any linked sites or their content. When you access an external website, keep in mind that SocialVibe has no control over its content.
Any link from SocialVibe to an external website does not imply or mean that SocialVibe endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content or the use of such website. SocialVibe does not give any representation regarding the quality, safety, suitability, or reliability of any external websites or any of the content or materials contained in them. It is important for users to take necessary precautions, especially to ensure appropriate safety from viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other potentially destructive items.
When visiting external websites, users should review those websites' privacy policies and other terms of use to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use any PII.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by SocialVibe.
You should also be aware that most content delivered through SocialVibe originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise gather PII and/or NPII about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself.
Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information that is Non Personally Identifying Information (“NPII”) information that does not uniquely identify an individual. For example, we collect information about the use of the SocialVibe, including information about users SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”).
By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above‐described NPII information in anonymous form as long as SocialVibe sees fit.
Children Under the Age of 13
SocialVibe does not knowingly collect or solicit PII from anyone under the age of 13. No one under age 13 may provide any PII to or on SocialVibe. In the event that we learn that we have collected PII from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child fewer than 13, please contact us at privacy@socialvibe.com.
Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18
We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

We do not sell or rent your PII to any third party. We may, however, use certain information about you that is NPII.

Due to our contractual obligations with these Third Parties and the need to share information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt‐out of sharing information with these Third Parties if the PII is collected when a user explicitly enters for the purpose of providing it to one of our advertisers (i.e., entering a sweepstakes); however a user may opt out of sharing information when a user signs up with Socialvibe.com, our charity site, and provides a real first name, last name and email address. In this case, SocialVibe will permit users to close/cancel their account and SocialVibe will delete the user’s record from our database.
