Privacy policy - SocialbriteSocialbrite
We respect your privacy.
Socialbrite will never sell or trade your registration information or spam you. (We hate spam as much as you do.) We will not share such information with partners, affiliates, vendors, advertisers, sponsors or other third parties, unless required by law.
We do not monitor the domain name or IP address of those who visit our site, except in aggregate totals so that we know how many people are visiting.
We don’t track your movements through cookies or other means.
Socialbrite may disclose information it collects if it believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its site rules or other policies, to comply with the law and the legal process, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its users or others.
We may collect names, email addresses and affiliations from people who want more information from us — but only from those who opt in.
