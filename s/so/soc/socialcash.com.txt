Activity Logs and Cookies
Spruce Media utilizes industry standard analytics packages which gathers limited information on visitors to our website automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, basic IP information, referring pages, computer operating system and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual people; it is used only for site administration, as well as for analysis of website usage. Cookies may also be used to provide easier and faster access to website features such as logins and/or returning visits. Cookies are small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes. We do not link the information stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information you have submitted while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when your browser is closed, and a persistent cookie may stay on your hard drive for an extended period. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site; persistent cookies can perform such activities as storing your password so you do not have to sign in every time you visit those areas, and/or may be used to enable us to track and target the behavior of our users so as to enhance the overall experience of using our site.
In addition, Spruce Media uses cookies in connection with consumers visiting the web pages of our clients to whom we provide services. The data we collect in connection with consumers is used solely for tracking clicks and web events – and is not used for any multiple-site data collection.
