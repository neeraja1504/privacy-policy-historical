Additionally, Customers include individuals who self-register to access our Applications.
CUSTOMER BUSINESS CONTACTS: Customer Business Contacts are individuals that interact with our Customers through our Applications. These include our Customers’ current and prospective clients, members, attendees, sponsors, exhibitors, marketing partners, hotel guests or other business contacts.

When Customer Business Contacts voluntarily and explicitly enter personal data into our Applications.
When our Customers enter Customer Business Contacts into our Applications, when permitted, including by having a legitimate business interest or obtaining explicit consent from a Customer Business Contact.
Automatically, as Customer Business Contacts interact with our Applications, using commonly used information gathering technologies such as cookies. For additional information about these technologies, see the section below titled “ How does Social Tables use cookies and similar technologies? “.
How do our Customers use personal data?
If a Customer Business Contact chooses to use our Applications to conduct business with a Customer (for example: register for or check into an event or use our event design tools), any information provided in connection with that interaction will be transferred to, and under the control of, the Customer.
Customers will also have access to information (including personal data and Application usage data) related to how Customer Business Contact interact with the Applications they use. In such instance, the Customers act as data controllers towards the Customer Business Contact, under the European Economic Area (“EEA”) data protection laws.  Therefore, Social Tables cannot and does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of Customers.
The information practices of our Customers are governed by their privacy policies. We encourage Customer Business Contacts to review the Customers’ privacy policies to understand their practices and procedures.
Social Tables does not use personal data of our Customer Business Contacts for any purposes other than to provide services that our Customers have contracted us to provide through our Applications, as noted below, or as required by law. Social Tables does not sell personal data of our Customer Business Contacts.
We collect personal data from our Customers in order to facilitate communication and delivery of the Applications that our Customers are interested in or contract us to provide. For example, we may collect Customer contact information, whether through the execution of a contract, use of our services, a form on our website, an interaction with our sales or customer support team, sign up for an event, or a response to one of our surveys or marketing emails. We may also collect credit card information (e.g., credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) or other customary bank information needed for billing and payment purposes.
We may record Customer telephone calls made to our Client Services team for legitimate business interests related to providing Customer support, compliance with laws, training, and quality assurance. We retain such recordings until 90 days after the date of recording.
We collect Customer usage information about how our Customers interact with our Applications. This includes which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you perform certain actions, what language preference you have, what you buy, and so on.
We process Customer’s and their Customer Business Contacts’ personal data in the following manner:
To disclose to our affiliates for the purpose of providing services to our Customers and their Customer Business Contacts.
To disclose to contractors, service providers, and other third parties as reasonably necessary or prudent to provide, maintain and support our Applications for our Customers and their Customer Business Contacts, such as, for example, payment processors and data center or Web hosting providers.  ** Social Tables does not share, sell or trade any information with such third parties for promotional purposes.**
To deliver the Applications that our Customer has contracted us to provide. Some examples include:
If a Customer or Customer Business Contact communicates with our customer service team, we use the information to ensure the proper level of support is given.
If a Customer or Customer Business Contact uses credentials for other third-party applications to login to Social Tables, we confirm their information with the third-party application.
If a Customer or Customer Business Contact edits information within the application, we save the time, date and interactions in order for them to be read by other users.
If a Customer or Customer Business Contact uses one of our Applications to pay for event fees or other products and services using their credit cards, we will pass the credit card information to payment card processors to validate the payment information and complete the transactions.
To deliver to a third party in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, recapitalization, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all Social Tables’ assets, whether as a continuing operating business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Social Tables about our Customers and Customer Business Contacts is among the assets transferred.

It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If a User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or User may contact us via the contact information at the bottom of this policy.
As we believe to be necessary or appropriate:  (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; and (c) to protect against or identify fraudulent transactions.
For other purposes when Customer Business Contacts provide explicit consent.

None of the aggregated and anonymized information contain personal data (i.e., does not identify any individual).
For individuals that are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using their personal information will be our legitimate interest where the processing is in our, or a third party's, legitimate interests and not overridden by the individual’s data protection interests, or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests are to provide individuals with access to the Applications and features of the Applications; to send them information they have requested; to ensure the security of our Applications by trying to prevent unauthorised or malicious activities; or to enforce compliance with our terms of use, contracts and other policies. In some EEA countries, we are relying on consent as a legal basis for using data for marketing purposes.
In various countries, including countries in the EEA, upon their request, Customer Business Contacts have the right to access their personal data and, if necessary, have it amended, deleted or restricted. Customer Business Contacts can also ask for some types of personal data to be delivered to them, or another organization they nominate, in a structured and machine-readable format.
Where we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. See the Social Tables contact section below. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Customer Business Contacts also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection in the country where they live, or where they work – although we hope that we can assist with any queries or concerns you have about our use of your personal data.
We process Customer Business Contacts data under the direction of our Customers and has no direct control or ownership of the personal data we process. Customers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws requiring notice, disclosure, or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Social Tables for processing purposes. Any Customer Business Contact that seeks to access, correct or delete data, should direct their query to the Customer. If the Customer requests Social Tables to remove the personal data of a Customer Business Contact to comply with data protection regulations, Social Tables will process this request within 30 days.
We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In such instances, we will inform the Customer about the legal obligations that prevent us from fulfilling the request.
How can a Customer access, correct, or delete their personal data?
Customers have the same rights to access, correct or delete their personal data as do Customer Business Contacts, as outlined in section “How can a Customer Business Contact access, correct or delete their personal data?”
Any Customer that seeks to access, correct or delete data, can do so by submitting a request on our website at https://www.cvent.com/gdpr-personal-data-request. Social Tables will process this request within 30 days.
We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In such instances, we will inform the Customer about the legal obligations that prevent us from fulfilling the request.

Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a Customer or Customer Business Contact from using certain portions of our Applications, depending on how the browser settings are configured. Unless the browser setting has been adjusted so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when the browser interacts with our Applications.  For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see  www.allaboutcookies.org.

Web Beacons.   Pages in our Applications and our e-mails will contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs).  Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users, for example: to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).  This enables us to provide a website experience more tailored to our Users’ preferences and interests.
