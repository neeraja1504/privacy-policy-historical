COPPA Statement
We do not collect nor maintain personally identifiable information from individual users under the age of thirteen (13) years under any circumstances.
The privacy and thus the safety of young persons is of the utmost importance. Personal information is defined as individually identifiable information such as an e-mail address, a telephone number, first and last name, a home or other physical address including a street name, city or town and the like. We are committed to respecting and protecting your personal privacy paying particular attention to the privacy needs of children. While the content of this site is directed at an older demographic, I have taken care to exclude any material that would be considered inappropriate for a younger audience. Children under the age of thirteen (13) should not interact with the contact page, or any commenting features on this site. In the instance a child does convey personal information that is considered identifiable, we have pledged to report it to authorities with the goal of having them notify the parents. Any user who indicates they are under the age of thirteen (13) will be banned from interactive content until their parents contact administrators directly.
