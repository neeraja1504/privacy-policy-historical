This Privacy Policy describes Just's current policies and practices with regard to Other Data and Secured Data.
Secured Data
Your security and privacy are our top priorities, therefore we built SafeWallet with the clear understanding that your Secured Data is private and that it should not be accessible to anyone, not even us. Secured Data entered by you is automatically encrypted locally on your device (and only then sent to our servers) and can only be decrypted by you, by entering your master password.
All of your Secured Data is stored on our servers only in its encrypted format, which it is not possible for us to decrypt. When you decide to transmit your Secured Data to third party sites, the transmission is done by way of a secure server. We use AES 256 BIT encryption along with additional security technologies to ensure the confidentiality of the Secured Data being transferred.
