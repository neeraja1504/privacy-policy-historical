If you are resident in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA)
Where we are offering or providing products or services to you and you are resident in a member state of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), we will observe the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws when we collect, use or disclose your Personal Data.
If you are an EU/EEA resident and we offer or provide products or services to you, the following additional provisions apply in relation to how we handle your Personal Data.
The types of Personal Data collected, the means of collection and purposes of processing remain the same as those set out at section 1 above, save that we will only provide marketing by email where we have your consent in accordance with applicable law or are sending you information about goods or services that are the same as those you have previously purchased, and subject to you being able to opt-out of further direct marketing at any time.
The lawful grounds on which we collect data
We process your Personal Data for the purposes relying on one or more of the following lawful grounds:
where you have freely provided your specific, informed and unambiguous consent for particular purposes;
where we agree to provide product(s) and/or services to you, in order to take any pre-contract steps at your request and/or to perform our contractual obligations to you;
where we need to use your Personal Data for legitimate purposes relevant to us being able to manage the administration and business operations of SGPPL (and keep records of the same), to make sure we follow internal policies and procedures so we can deliver the best service to you, to prevent and detect criminal activity that could be damaging for you or us, to make sure we can keep in touch regarding orders and offers, and to promote our business to existing and former customers. We will always seek to pursue these legitimate interests in a way that does not unduly infringe on your other legal rights and freedoms and, in particular, your right of privacy;
where we need to protect your vital interests or those of someone else (such as in a medical emergency); and/or
where we need to collect, process or hold your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation.
If you provide us with any ‘special category’ Personal Data about you in relation to health, religious/ political or philosophical beliefs, ethnic origin and/or sex life/ sexual orientation, in addition to the above, we will only use this special category Personal Data in the following circumstances:
where we have your explicit consent;
where needed to comply with applicable social security or social protection laws;
to protect your vital interests (or those of someone else) in an emergency;
where you have already publicised such information; and/or
where we need to use such special category Personal Data in connection with a legal claim that we have or may be subject to.
When your Personal Data may be disclosed to third parties
We only allow our service providers (as described at section 5 above) to handle your Personal Data on our behalf if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect it. We impose contractual obligations on service providers to ensure they can only use your Personal Data to provide services to us and to you.
If we need to share some Personal Data with other parties, such as potential buyers of some or all of our business or during a re-structuring usually information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. The recipient of the information will however be bound by confidentiality obligations.
Other than as set out in this DPP, we will treat your Personal Data as private and will not disclose it to third parties without you knowing it. The exceptions are in relation to legal proceedings or where we are legally required to provider your data to a court, regulator or someone else and can't tell you.
In all cases we always aim to ensure that your Personal Data is only used by third parties for lawful purposes and in compliance with application data protection law.
Transferring your Personal Data
You acknowledge that your Personal Data will be transferred to SGPPL, and processed and stored in the Singapore. Please note that the Act is not at present considered to meet the same legal standards of protection for Personal Data as European Union law.
However, in order to safeguard your Personal Data, we only transfer data from the EU/EEA to Singapore under a contract or another appropriate mechanism that is approved under applicable law and that protects that data to the same standards that you would expect in Europe.
Keeping your Personal Data
SGPPL retains your Personal Data you for as long as you have a relationship with us; as necessary to perform our obligations to you (or to enforce or defend legal claims); or, as is required by applicable law.
The criteria we use for determining data retention periods is based on various legislative requirements; the purpose for which we hold data and whether retaining the data is needed in connection with that purpose; and further specific guidance issued by relevant regulatory authorities on data retention/erasure including, but not limited to, EU regulatory authorities.
Personal Data that we no longer need is either erased and/or anonymised so that you can no longer be identified from it.
We employ appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data from being accessed by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We also endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from external threats such as malicious software or hacking. However, there are always inherent risks in sending information by public networks or using public computers and we cannot 100% guarantee the security of all data sent to us.
Your Personal Data rights
Under the GDPR, those EU/EEA residents with whom we deal have various data protection rights, which are as follows:
you can request information about the Personal Data that we hold about you, what we use that Personal Data for; who it may be shared with as well as certain other information (this is called a 'subject access right'). Usually we will have a month to respond to a 'subject access right' request although where we have a complex request, we may require a further two months to respond. We may also charge for administrative time in dealing with any manifestly unreasonable or excessive requests. We may also require further information to locate specific information you seek and you should note that certain legal exemptions may also apply to what we can disclose in response;
you can ask that we correct Personal Data that we hold about you which is inaccurate or incomplete;
you can object to us conducting any automated processing in relation to your Personal Data (if applicable), for example if we conduct any automated credit scoring;
you can object to us continuing to use your Personal Data to send you direct marketing;
you can request that we erase your Personal Data if we no longer need to hold it;
you can object or ask us to restrict the use of your Personal Data for any purpose unless we have a compelling legitimate reason for doing so (e.g. a legal obligation); or
you can ask us to transfer your electronically held Personal Data to another party where it has been collected with your consent or is being used by us to perform contact.
If you would like to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the contact details above. We may need to ask for evidence to verify your identity before we can fully respond.
If you make a request and are not satisfied with our response, or believe that we are illegally processing your Personal Data, you have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority in your EU country of residence.
