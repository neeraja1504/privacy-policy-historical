Privacy Policy
This SVP WORLDWIDE Privacy Policy was updated on February 21, 2019. Your privacy is important to SVP Worldwide so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with SVP Worldwide or an affiliated company. SVP Worldwide and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.
Here are some examples of the types of personal information SVP Worldwide may collect and how we may use it:
What personal information we collect

Create a mySewnet™ account,
Purchase a product from SINGER®, HUSQVARNA VIKING®, or PFAFF®,

Credit card information.
How we use your personal  information
We may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by SVP Worldwide or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.
The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on SVP Worldwide’s latest sales and promotions, product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any communication.
We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising
We may use your personal information, including date of birth to determine appropriate services. For example, the mySewnet™ site is not intended for users under the age of 16.
From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with SVP Worldwide, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve SVP Worldwide’s products, services, and customer communications.
If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
We may collect information such as language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, and referrer URL so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.
With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help our app developers improve our apps.
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
As is true of most Internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. SVP Worldwide may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.

Disclosure to Third Parties
At times SVP Worldwide may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with SVP Worldwide to provide products and services, or that help SVP Worldwide market to customers. Personal information will only be shared by SVP Worldwide to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.
Service Providers
SVP Worldwide shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever SVP Worldwide operates.
Protection of Personal Information
SVP Worldwide takes the security of your personal information very seriously. When SVP Worldwide stores your personal data, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.
Automated Decision-Making
SVP Worldwide does not make any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.
Integrity and Retention of Personal Information
SVP Worldwide makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless law requires a longer retention period.
Access to Personal Information
We will provide you with access (including a copy) to your personal information for any purpose (including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if SVP Worldwide is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes). We may decline to process requests that jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. To make a request, please contact us.
