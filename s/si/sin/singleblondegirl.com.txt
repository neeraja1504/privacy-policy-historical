Overview
This is a social networking website. With very few exceptions, ie: where you enter your email address to register or login, all of the information you enter on our site will be published on this site. This means that the search engines bots will read and index what you publish. Additionally people and other bots from anywhere in the world may also read and/or copy whatever you publish. We have no control over what people or bots access the page and/or what the people or bots do with the information.
For that reason it is not advisable to enter your email address except for our website site registration and to login. Additionally it is not advisable to publish phone numbers, addresses, or other personally identifiable information. Even if you delete an entry from our site, we have no control over those who may have copied the information.
Commercial Posting
The purpose of our websites is to be a topical social network. That means the free and open exchange of information, opinions, recommendations, experiences, etc related to the topic of the site. This of course, also includes commercial postings, ie: posting information and links to your products and services.
The key is participation not link dropping (making a post and never returning). However, we are in the processing of limiting the commercial posting to those who also participate socially in an active manner. Some sections require you to "earn points" before you can use them.
In other cases postings and/or links will be deleted if we feel their are unsuitable, ie: a single or multiple short post just to get links to your website. In cases of abuse, ie: repeating commercial postings without any social participation or off-topic commercials posts, your account and access to our network of sites may be disabled.
Those who earn points and have a link published with their post will receive a standard dofollow link. However, if you don't continue to participate over the time link will be changed to a nofollow style link, and later, the link with be replaced with a message that it is an inactive listing.
The cornerstone of our new policy on social participation is for you to build a "expanded profile" (click on your profile) where you can make a comprehensive and interesting page for your business, services, website, etc. You don't need a website to participate, and if you have one you are welcome (and encouraged) to link to it. It is recommended you create an "expanded profile" as the starting point for your participation.
All of your social interaction will be automatically linked to your "profile", leaving you to simply participate socially and build interest in your abilities, skills, interests, experiences and develop friendships that will lead you to be the other members think of when they need your product or service.
Additionally, anyone who engages in commercial posting, through our profiles or otherwise, may be emailed with directly relevant emails. ie: if the moderator deletes a commercial post, if a directory submission is approved, etc.
Please do not enter URLs, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc for the titles of your posts, profile name, etc. This may result in the information be replaced with [deleted] and/or the removal of all your accounts. It also means that information is likely to be indexed by the search engines and someone searching for your email address (if you publish it in a post) may find that post.
