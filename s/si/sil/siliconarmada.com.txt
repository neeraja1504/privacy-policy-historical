Silicon Armada (referred to as: Website) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. The following statement explains Website's commitment to managing your personal information and sets out how and when personal information is collected, held, used or disclosed.
Information About All Website Visitors
The Company authorizes You to view and access a single copy of the content available on or from Website (the "Web Site") solely for your personal, non-commercial use.
We gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Website visitors use our site, and also create a better overall experience for you. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Website to any outside parties, except when the law requires it.
Information About You Specifically
Website is a career site, we retain your personal information to assist in your career performance or management including finding or retaining work; or to facilitate other services to or by us. For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we collect more specific personal information about you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, qualifications or career history. If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive information about you such as information about your membership in a professional or trade association or trade union. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. When you grant us your permission, we will communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey information on using the Website site to maximise your career development. Website also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your My Website account and edit your account profile. If you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Website and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information will be collected, used and becomes the property of both Website and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Website is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives or how it is used. If you do not provide us with the information sought in the required fields Website may be limited in its ability to provide you with services.
Disclosure of your information to other people
We may use other companies and third parties to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information and such information may be transferred overseas. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.
We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this:
You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.
You can allow your resume to be searchable by employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals who pay for access to our resume database and your resume. When you opt to make your resume searchable, you still have the choice to make your personal details confidential where all of your contact information and even your current place of employment can remain hidden. We use our best efforts to restrict access to our database only to those who have paid for access; these parties may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We take all reasonable steps to ensure parties other than those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. We endeavour to ensure those who gain access to your resume comply with the relevant privacy laws, however Website is not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We may share your information with our related companies. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
