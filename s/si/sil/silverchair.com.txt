Security
We (like all websites) cannot warrant or guarantee 100% security of any information you transmit to us through the Site.  However, Silverchair implements physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your information both online and offline. Information we collect online is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way (you may verify this by looking for a lock icon and “https” in the address bar). We also protect your information offline by restricting employee access to the data we collect and by storing that data on secure servers.
Managing “Do Not Track” Signals
Some browsers have a Do Not Track (“DNT”) feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want your online activities tracked.  When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity via cookies or other tracking technologies.  Our Site currently does not respond to DNT signals. Response to DNT signals by third-parties who provide tracking software used on the Site is based on those companies’ settings.
Complaints, Questions, or Concerns
If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us.
Any data subject may approach our Chief Data Protection Officer at any time to raise concerns, ask questions, request information or make complaints relating to data protection or data security issues.  You can contact our Chief Data Protection Officer at dataprivacy@silverchair.com.
In addition, if you are a resident of the European Union and consider that our processing of your Personal Information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection, for example, in the EU member state of your habitual residence.
