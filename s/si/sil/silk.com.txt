WhiteWave Foods strives to maintain the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in all our operations. Likewise, WhiteWave Foods is dedicated to protecting your privacy through compliance with this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites or any services available on or through the Sites.

WhiteWave Foods may collect personally identifiable information from you, meaning information about you that can be used to contact or uniquely identify you (“Personal Information”), only on a voluntary basis. Such Personal Information may include information such as your name, postal address, email address, company name, and telephone number.
We collect Personal Information from you if you request information from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, or sign up to join our email lists. Personal Information we collect is internally reviewed and used to improve our Sites, to notify you of updates to our Sites or any products or services we offer, to respond to visitor inquiries, to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, and to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide your Personal Information to us. Once your Personal Information is reviewed, it is either discarded or stored in our files.
If you supply us with your postal address, you will receive only the information you request at the time you provide your postal address to us. Your Personal Information, including without limitation your postal address, will not be sold or provided to third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will seek to obtain written or active email consent from you if we intend to use information collected from you in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection.
Non-Personal Information
In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, including through automated means such as cookies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a user’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the user’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. For example, our Sites may automatically recognize the domain name of the website, or the advertisement, which referred you to one of our Sites (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account). Cookies enable us to track things in aggregate form such as the total number of visitors to our Sites, the popularity of various areas of our Sites, and the length of the visits to our Sites. No Personal Information is extracted in this process. The information we collect using automated means is used for internal review to improve the Sites, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.
Information We Share
In order to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale. In the event we transfer any of your information in connection with such a sale, we will post a notice on our website and we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser of your information honors your opt-out requests, if any.
We may disclose your Personal Information to our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
We may also disclose your Personal Information when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, property or safety of WhiteWave Foods, our employees, customers, Site visitors, or others.
Other than as set forth above, we will not share or sell your information to any outside organization without your written or electronically-indicated consent.
