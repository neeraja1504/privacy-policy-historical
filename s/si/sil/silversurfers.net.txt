4 Cookies and analytics
4.1 The Site, in common with most websites, has cookies which enable a much easier experience for our users and also allow us to improve our site.. Cookies are simply “text files” which contain just two pieces of information which a website name and a unique user ID (a user ID is the same as a username. It’s just a sequence of characters and numbers that is used when you log into a computer or onto the Internet and is used for identification). Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie policy.
4.2 Cookies work by being downloaded onto your Personal Computer (PC) the first time you visit a website. Then the next time you visit that website your PC just checks to see if it has a Cookie that is relevant to that site and send the information contained in the Cookie back to the website. All this takes milliseconds. The website then “checks” that you have been on it before by the use of the Cookie check and with this then varies the content which is presented to you on the website according to what you have used the previous time or even multiple times.
4.3 Some Cookies are much more sophisticated for example they can record how long you stay on certain pages and what you click on in those pages and even your preferences for page layouts, and which banner adverts you prefer so that different adverts can be shown to you. The benefits of Cookies are many; they really make your interaction with websites much easier so for example, they remember details when you are shopping online making this experience much easier
4.4 We also use Google analytics on our Site which measure how many users and customers we have on the website and which pages they visit. We use this information to understand how our Site is performing and many large websites use similar analytics from companies like Google.
5 Banners, links and contacts to other websites
When using our Site you may go through to other websites, blogs, forums, adverts, competition and offers. When doing this, this Site’s privacy policy does not apply and the privacy policy and terms and conditions of that website, blog, forum, advert, competition apply. We take no responsibility or liability for any information, cookies or information collected by these other sites.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these sites.
