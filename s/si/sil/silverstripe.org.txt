Personal Information
“Personal Information” refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual, and may include, but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, occupation, and other information required to provide a service, deliver a product, share marketing content, or carry out a transaction that you have requested.
We will always indicate before we collect any Personal Information from you and will only use it for the purposes specified at the time of collection. We will not change the way your Personal Information is used without your consent.
What information do we collect?
Activity history
SilverStripe uses server logs to register website visitor activity and downloads. Logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the pages you visit. Logged information is not personally identifiable. However, if you identify yourself by filling out a form on one of our websites and providing us with Personal Information, any existing and future information collected about your activity history will be linked to your Personal Information.
Our server logs will not be shared with any third-party. However, from time to time, we may elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity based on log information. We will never publish any personally identifiable information.
Any use of activity history that we collect is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information and contact details
At certain times, we will request Personal Information from you in connection with online registration or enquiry forms, when requesting product or service information, when downloading marketing content, or when providing comments or feedback on the site. We only collect Personal Information requested at the time of collection.
If you identify yourself by filling out a form on one of our websites and providing us with Personal Information, any existing and future information collected about your activity history will be linked to your Personal Information. Providing this information is voluntary. However, failure to provide Personal Information when requested may result in certain services or resources being unavailable to you.
Any use of Personal Information and contact details that we collect is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

What do we do with the information we collect?
If you provide SilverStripe with your contact details for the purpose of online registration, submitting an enquiry, requesting product or service information, or downloading marketing content, we may use this information to get in contact with you. The purpose of that contact will be to respond directly to your enquiry or request, and in some cases, to determine if you have other needs we can respond to.
If you have downloaded marketing content from a SilverStripe website, we may contact you to determine if you have other needs that we can respond to. However, if you select a country within the European Union on the download form, you will be given the option to opt-out of receiving communications that you have not specifically requested.
