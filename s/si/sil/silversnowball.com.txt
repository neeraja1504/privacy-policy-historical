PRIVACY POLICY
PRIVACY POLICY
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive
and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,
telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
Please be assured we will never sell, barter, or rent your
email address to any unauthorized third party.
How We Gather Information From Users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate
and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to
provide information when you register for access to certain
portions of our site or request certain features, such as more
information, newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may
provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, SILVERSNOWBALL.COM
also collects information automatically and through the use of
electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter
that information each time you visit, or may control the number
of times you encounter a particular advertisement while
visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may
also gather information through other means. In certain cases,
you can choose not to provide us with information, for example
by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you
do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or
may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we
may not be able to customize the site's features according to
your preferences.
Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so
under two conditions:  one, they give their permission for
contact by the website; two, they are subject to any submission
provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this
Privacy Policy.
What We Do With The Information We Collect
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and
advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your
information with anyone.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may
combine information about your usage patterns with similar
information obtained from other users to help enhance our site
and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may
occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business
partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone
to identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM to communicate with you about your
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of
Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM and other topics we think you might find of
interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM may also be used for other purposes,
including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide
technical support for the operation of our site (our Web
hosting service for example) may access such information. We
will use your information only as permitted by law. In
addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our
business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other
companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information
may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, at other times when
we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in
connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it
appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you
with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED
Credit card information or other financial information is not
usually known to the website.  However, in the event that it is
made known, that information is never revealed to anyone except
to processing authorities or law enforcement agencies.
However, the provider of such information gives express
permission to use it in fraud investigation or for litigation.
CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS
If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if
you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website
collects information about your communication.  By
communicating with the site you give your permission to
collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information
collected as the site sees fit.
Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems
to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.
Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites And Advertisements
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including our partners,
advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible
through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your
visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame
on a SILVERSNOWBALL.COM page, certain content that is actually
created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, Web sites, features, contests or
sweepstakes offered by other parties. SILVERSNOWBALL.COM is not
responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties.
You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
parties when providing information on a feature or page
operated by a third party.
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be
collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and
may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
SILVERSNOWBALL.COM and this policy.
While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not
have access to any information we have about you, we do not
warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and
thus have access to your information.
