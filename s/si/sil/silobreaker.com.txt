your personal data in this way to complete the booking contract between us.
3.3.2     We may provide attendees lists to the organisations and other individuals who
attend our events. We do this because our events provide a useful networking

HOW AND WHERE WE STORE PERSONAL DATA
8.1 Although none of our group companies are based outside the European Economic Area (”EEA”),
we work with third parties who are. This means the processing of your personal data will involve
a transfer of data outside the EEA.
8.2 Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making
sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
8.2.1           by transferring your personal data to a country that has been deemed to provide an
adequate level of protection by the European Commission;
8.2.2           by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your
personal data the same protection it has as if it stayed in the EEA;
8.2.3           where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are
part of the Privacy Shield programme which requires them to provide similar
protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
8.3 Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when
transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
8.4 All personal data that we collect or you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of
our third party storage providers.
8.5 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
certain parts of our website or services, you are responsible for keeping this password
confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA FOR
9.1 We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
9.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature,
and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure
of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we
can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
9.3 By law we have to keep basic information about our clients (including contact, identity, financial
and transaction data) for six years after they cease being clients for tax purposes.
-9-
9.4  Data we aggregate from public sources, from which our software may capture personal data, is
removed from our index and storage continually, in some cases as soon as after 60 days and
normally no longer than two years from the publication date, unless there are specific reasons
for us to keep it.
9.5  Personal data collected in relation to events or used for marketing and other activities to promote
our company and offerings will be reviewed regularly and in cases for communications which you
have opted-in to receive, we will contact you every four years to ensure you are happy to continue
receiving these communications.
9.6  Where we have processed your data for any other reason (such as where you have contacted
us with a question in connection with a customer service question) we will retain your data for
two years.
9.7  In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be
associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this
information indefinitely without further notice to you.
10.  YOUR RIGHTS
10.1 You have the right to:
10.1.1       Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access
request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
10.1.2       Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you
to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we
may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
10.1.3       Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where
you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required
to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may
not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons
which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
10.1.4       Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel
-10-
it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
10.1.5        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask
us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if
you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data
even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
10.1.6        Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
we used the information to perform a contract with you.
10.1.7        Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your
personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried
out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
case at the time you withdraw your consent.
10.2 If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at privacy-
inquiries@silobreaker.com
11.  NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
12.  WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure
your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed
up our response.
-11-
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In
this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
