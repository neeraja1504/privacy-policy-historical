Privacy Policy - Sifter
We care deeply about your privacy and the privacy of your data. We strive to maintain the highest possible backup and security standards to protect that data. And we aim to be as transparent as possible about our practices. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about how we can improve, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
We never record or capture any personally identifiable information unless you explicitly provide that information to us for the purposes of subscribing to one of our newsletters or setting up a Sifter account.
For Analytics & Advertising
When you visit our marketing site, we use common analytics tools to track statistical information so we can things like test conversion rates and understand which pages are most useful to folks. We do all of this in aggregate without any personally identifiable information.
We also use cookies for retargeted advertising. If you’d prefer not to see any retargeting ads from us, just visit our retargeting optout page and we’ll make sure you don’t see any more of them. (You may still other ads from us that don’t use retargeting, though.) If you want to entirely opt-out of retargeted advertising from our provider, Perfect Audience, you can do that by visiting their privacy policy page.
For Newsletter Subscribers
All of our email newsletters require double opt-in and allow you to unsubscribe immediately with a single click. Our newsletter software, Campaign Monitor, tracks open rates, clicks, and related data tied to each email address.
For Customers
For customers, we only record the data we need for you to access and use Sifter, and all of that data is entirely under your control and can be deleted or updated by you at any time. We only use this data to personalize your account and provide support. We will never use your account information or that of any of your users’ accounts for marketing purposes.
We believe that your personal data should only be seen by you unless you choose to share it with others. We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party, including advertisers or partners, without your permission.
The only instances where we would share your information are…
When you explicitly set up an integration with a third party service provider. In this case, we only share the bare minimum amount of information to connect with the other service.
If Sifter is acquired by or merges with another company. We don’t expect this to ever happen, but if it does, we’ll notify you well in advance of your data becoming subject to another privacy policy.
When it’s necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action related to illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
A Note on Law Enforcement
We’ll never turn over your data to law enforcement unless we are required to do so by a court order. We will reject any such requests if they seek access to your data without a court order. And, unless we’re prevented from telling you for legal reasons, we’ll notify you any time such a request is made for your data.
We encrypt all data and communications between you and our site with SSL/TLS and record your IP address with every request for security purposes. You can visit our security page for the full details on our commitment to the security of your data and personal information.
We don’t frequently change our privacy policy, but if we do, we’ll share a prominent notification on our site. Of course, if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re always happy to answer any questions you have.
