SICI PRIVACY GUIDELINES
SICI PRIVACY GUIDELINES
The Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute (SICI) is committed to providing visitors with a
web site that respects their privacy. This page summarizes the privacy policy and
practices on the SICI web site.
SICIâ€™s website does not automatically gather any specific personal information from
you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. We would only obtain
this type of information if you supply it by sending us an email or by applying for a
membership, fellowship, or award in a secure section of the web site.
All personal information held or collected by SICI is protected under the Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (popularly referred to as
PIPEDA). This means that at any point of collection you will be asked for consent to
collect your information, and you will be informed of the purpose for which it is
being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.
SICI employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This
software receives and records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer
that has contacted our Web site, the date and time of the visit and the pages
visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals
visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.
Information on individual visitors is used by SICI employees who need to know the
information in order to respond to your request or to ensure the security of this
system. We do not use the information to create individually identifiable profiles,
nor do we disclose this information to anyone outside of SICI.
Questions or comment regarding this policy of the administration of PIPEDA at SICI
may be directed to Programme Officer (Communications) Shastri Indo-Canadian
Institute by telephone at 403-220-7467 or by email at sici@ucalgary.ca
