Email marketing
If you opt-in to receive marketing emails from us, we’ll send you a few emails each week keeping you up-to-date with news of our latest products, offers and in-store events.
In order to receive emails from us, you only need to provide us with your email address. To help you get the most out of our emails, you have the option of telling us a bit more about yourself. By letting us know things like your age, gender and interests, we are able to send you more relevant email content. You are not obliged to do this, and you can update your preferences within your customer account at any time.
If you’ve bought from us, we may use this information to send you emails about similar products that may be of interest to you. Some emails that we send will be based on actions that you take on our website, for example buying or viewing a specific product. We do this to enhance your shopping experience, and to help you find products which we think may be useful to you. Rest assured that we will never make opting-in a condition of receiving a service from us.
You can opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by:
Clicking the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any of our marketing emails
Updating your email preferences within your customer account
Contacting our customer care team
If you opt-out of receiving marketing emails, you will still receive important order and delivery information by email.
Reviews
To help provide our customers with a fair and transparent shopping experience, we have partnered with two online review platforms: Trustpilot and Bazaarvoice. Following a purchase, we will securely transfer your email address to these companies who will then use this information only for the purposes of inviting you to leave a review.
Here’s how they work:
Trustpilot
Within 24 hours of placing your order, you’ll receive an email from us via Trustpilot inviting you to leave a review of your shopping experience. To leave a review you’ll need to create an account on Trustpilot. To edit or remove a review you have written, you will need to contact Trustpilot directly.
You can access Trustpilot’s privacy policy here.
Bazaarvoice
Around 2 weeks after receiving your product, we may send you an email inviting you to review and rate the product that you purchased.
Once submitted, it usually takes 72 hours for your review, question or answer to appear on the website providing it adheres to our publishing guidelines. Your review can be submitted anonymously or if you prefer you can leave a ratings only review. To edit or remove a review you have written, please contact us.
You can access Bazaarvoice's privacy policy here.
