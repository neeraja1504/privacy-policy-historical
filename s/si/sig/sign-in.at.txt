Protection of the Personal Data
The protection of the personal data and your privacy is important to us.

These Service Providers are only permitted to use the personal data in connection with their functions and not for their own purposes.
We may disclose the personal data to a third-party in order to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our property, or violations of the Terms of Use.
The user understands that the personal data is available and accessible by our employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide Services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We can only speak for ourselves; this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, or individuals that we do not employ or manage.
Security
The security of the personal data is important to us. We use certain technologies to secure sensitive information (such as credit card number). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal data, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL) which is industry-leading technology to help your security when you enter credit card information. We use cookies to help (anonymously) recognize you as a repeat user and to track Website traffic patterns.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
