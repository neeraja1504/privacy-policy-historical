Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages of the Site are visited and by how many people. Sitebeat cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Sitebeat's coolest features.
Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our Site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.
Sharing your Information
Because Sitebeat enables people to discover information about people and their jobs, information about the people who use Sitebeat is an integral part of the Sitebeat experience.

Protection of Sitebeat and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that such release is necessary to comply with a law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other policies, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sitebeat, our employees, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
Sitebeat allows third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
Sitebeat does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Sitebeat to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example users interested to Buy a Car) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Sitebeat's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with Sitebeat is maintained and dealt with by Sitebeat in accordance with this privacy policy.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, on a notice on the Site, and/or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the Site.
