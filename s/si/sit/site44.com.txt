Information We Collect
Certain visitors to Planet Rational’s websites may choose to interact with Planet Rational in ways that require Planet Rational to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Planet Rational may gather will depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a website through our Service to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in financial transactions with Planet Rational may be asked to provide additional information, including address, phone number, and debit card or credit card information. In each case, Planet Rational collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Planet Rational. Planet Rational does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Planet Rational discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Planet Rational’s behalf or to provide services available at Planet Rational’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Planet Rational’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will protect the privacy and security of personally-identifying Information according to our Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored.
Planet Rational will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Planet Rational discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Planet Rational believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Planet Rational, third parties or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of an Planet Rational website and have supplied your email address, Planet Rational may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Planet Rational and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

Planet Rational uses cookies to help Planet Rational identify and track visitors, their usage of Planet Rational websites, and their website access preferences. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with other information we store about you in your profile (if you are a registered user) or as related to your interactions with our Service.

An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.

When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
