What Information We Collect
We collect and store some or all of the following information about our users: name; email address; IP Address; and billing information, such as address, phone number, and credit card number. If you do not wish to have your credit card number stored, please contact Customer Support. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www.mcafee.com. More information on our use of "cookies" can be found below. We may combine the information you submit under your account with other information from other McAfee Services or third parties in order to improve the quality of our services and provide you with a better experience.
In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences.
Web Applications
We may also employ certain applications, such as the various components of McAfee Services, to retrieve information about your computer system to assist us in the provision and support of Services that you have chosen to subscribe to or use. This information is essential to enable us to provide you with quality service; and for this reason, there is no opt-out available for this information collection.
Use of Data
McAfee uses your information to better understand your needs, provide you with the Services you have requested and provide you with better service. We may use your information to help you complete a transaction (including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers), to communicate back to you, to inform you of and update you on Services and benefits, to personalize our Web sites for you, to provide you Services and to manage and renew your subscription(s). Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing, maintenance of your subscription and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission.
Use of Your Email Address
If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we or our trusted business partners may send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from one or more of our trusted business partners. At the time you receive a confirmation of purchase or registration, you will be given the opportunity to opt into or out of such communications. If you do not initially choose to opt out, you may still block future email of this type, simply by following the unsubscribe instructions that accompany all such communications.
Separately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts; and to provide updates, upgrades, security alerts, security information and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our Services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked.
We follow best practices for email marketing and customer contact, as well as urge our trusted business partners and vendors to do the same. For more information on our practices, please see "Use of Data." More information on third parties with whom we may share your information is provided below under "Special Relationships."
We may share with third parties certain pieces of visitor and customer information that is statistically aggregated, and consists of non-personal information. In this circumstance, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, account, password, or transaction history.
Special Relationships
McAfee has a number of relationships with vendors with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, these vendors have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose.
Digital River
Digital River powers some of McAfee's e-commerce, and in doing so collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the McAfee Store powered by Digital River, information about the customer and the purchase are shared with McAfee. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission.
Digital River, on behalf of McAfee, may occasionally notify you of special offers, new products, services, promotions, and other similar information. This will only be done with your consent. If you gave consent to receive email from Digital River, on behalf of McAfee, any emails you receive will have clear unsubscribe instructions. For more information, read  Digital River's privacy policy
The information shared between McAfee and vendors is processed only for the purpose of performing contractual obligations, and no processing activity will be carried out by McAfee without prior notice to users, and where necessary, with users' consent. McAfee hereby expressly disclaims any liability for the data processing activities of the vendors above specified, which will act as independent data processing Controllers. Please read carefully such vendors' Privacy Policies before providing your personal data.
Links
Our site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web site. As McAfee does not accept liability for misuse of any information by any Web site controller to which we may link, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their privacy policies may differ from ours.
If you choose to take advantage of an offer from one of our trusted business partners, you may be providing information to such partner directly. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of such partners, as their policies may differ from ours.

McAfee also uses third parties for serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. To do this, such third parties collect non-personal information through the use of cookies about the types of sites you visit and other non-personally identifiable information about you in order to deliver advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements or providing other marketing services, third parties may place or recognize a unique, non-personally identifiable cookie in your browser.
