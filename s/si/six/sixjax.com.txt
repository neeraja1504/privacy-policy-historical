You may visit the Site at any time without revealing any personal information about yourself. However, when you visit the Site, we may collect and store your computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site, advertisement data, IP address and standard web log information, such as demographic and navigation data.
For you to actively participate in this Site, we do need some of your personal information. In providing us with your personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of such information on our servers.

Our purpose for collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience.

We may also share your personal information with third parties assisting our business operations under contract, including but not limited to: fraud investigations; debt collection; law enforcement or other governmental officials if required by law; and with other business entities with which we plan to merge with or be acquired by.
We do not share your personal information with third party advertisers.
As you register with the Site, you will be required to choose a user name. This user name will be displayed throughout the Site and therefore provided to the public. If you win an auction, the Site may display the number of bids and dollar value of those bids when the auction ends. Unless you associate your user name with your personal information, other users will not be able to personally identify your activities on the Site.
When visiting the Site from a public or shared computer, your personal information may also be visible to others who use that computer after your use. It is your responsibility to ensure your private information is removed from the public or shared computer should you choose to use one.
You can access, review and change most of your personal information by logging on to the Site at any time. However, some of your personal information can only be changed by contacting our Customer Service. Accurate information is required for billing and delivery purposes. You are required to promptly update your personal information if changes occur or information is inaccurate.
Upon closing your account, Sixjax will remove your information from public view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms & Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
Sixjax uses so-called "cookies", which are files that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in customizing your experience with the Site. The information saved in cookies supports the functionality of the Site, for example, by keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of "pop-up" windows. You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your computer by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. However, adjusting these settings may result in limited functionality.
Your Sixjax account and profile and the information contained therein are password protected. Please note that you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else. Sixjax will never ask for your password in e-mail or over the phone. Please remember to log out of your account and to close your Internet browser window when you leave the Site; this is especially important if you use a PC in a public location. We assume no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used.
Sixjax will use your e-mail address only for the purposes stated in the Terms & Conditions and this Privacy Policy. We will not rent or sell your e-mail address to third parties, and we will prevent your e-mail address from being recorded by "web crawlers" or "web spiders" to the best of our ability. If you believe that your e-mail address has been inappropriately disclosed, please email us at support@sixjax.com.
