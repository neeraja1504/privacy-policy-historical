We send all new members a welcoming email to verify their password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and the e-bulletins. Each user has the option to not receive these types of communications (see Choice/Opt-Out below).

Generally, users may not opt-out of receiving these service-related communications. In addition, we communicate with our users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their account via email.

Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we might buy the online and/or off-line retail operations of others. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that SixWise.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired by or transferred to another entity, customer information would likely be one of the transferred assets.
Government and Legal Disclosures of Your Information
We may disclose information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary in connection with an investigation of illegal activity that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain information about you with state or local government offices to perfect our security interest in the products so purchased, or to provide certain information about you to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute.
