At SIBCY CLINE, it is our intention to give you as much control as possible over your privacy in regard to your Information and the use we make of it in the course of your use of our website(s) located at  www.sibcycline.com, www.sibcy.com,  www.scrsmove.com, mortgage.sibcycline.com, www.sibcyclineinsurance.com (referred to as "website" or "our site"). Our mailing address is 8044 Montgomery Rd, Suite 300, Cincinnati, OH 45236. We can be reached via e-mail at  customercare@sibcycline.com or you can reach us by telephone at 513-985-4010.
Since we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
SIBCY CLINE gathers information about customers in two ways:
Registration: Information that users provide through optional and voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our Home Watch Service, to email a friend, and for scheduling appointments. Customers also provide information on our site to contact an agent to get further information on listings.
Usage tracking: Information SIBCY CLINE gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views (using IP address log analyses and through the use of Cookies) throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to customers' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does SIBCY CLINE divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.
SIBCY CLINE tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. SIBCY CLINE does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
SIBCY CLINE sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. SIBCY CLINE uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling, surveys, user session customization and membership services. Some of the features of the site may have limited or missing, or broken functionality if you choose not to accept cookies.
Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
How is the information you gather used if relevant?
SIBCY CLINE uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out Home Watch Alerts and to help our customers with the home buying and selling process.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
