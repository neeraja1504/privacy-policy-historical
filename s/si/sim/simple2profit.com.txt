Who's capture page is this?
The capture pages hosted on this site were created by Simple2Advertise, a customizable marketing platform. We allow our users to take our professionally crafted designs and customize them for their own use.
When you opt in to a users capture page, you are agreeing to be included on their mailing list. It is that affiliates responsibility to allow you to unsubscribe from all future mailings.
In almost ALL cases, Simple2Advertise itself DOES NOT CAPTURE ANY LEADS. We simply link a capture page with a S2A members' autoresponder system. We never see any of the email addresses entered into affiliate's capture pages, and will never contact an affiliate's leads for our own purposes. Results that are generated are the affiliates prospects who did the marketing to get that person to their capture page. Email addresses entered into a capture page are not shared with any other affiliates or S2A administrators and can not be, since we do not see them..
In some cases, pages on our website may be linked to other internet marketers' mailing lists. Due to this, we have no control over what they will do with your email.
