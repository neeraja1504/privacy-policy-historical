2.  ** Which information we may collect on our Users?**
We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:
a. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User’s use of the Service and/or the Exchange carrying the Service, as applicable (“ Non-personal Information ”).  We are not aware of the identity of the User from which the Non-personal Information was collected.
b. Non-personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the User’s operating system, type of browser, screen resolution, browser and keyboard language, the User’s ‘click-stream’ and activities on the Service, the period of time the User visited the Service and related time stamps, etc
c. Non-personal Information shall be gathered by us in order to perform preliminary examinations of the Exchange’s users before enabling such users to use the Service.
d. The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, or may be of private or sensitive nature (“ Personal Information ”).
Personal Information which is being gathered may consist of the following:
The User’s IP address, which is automatically provided by the User and used mainly for enhancing the User’s experience and for geolocation, personalisation and security purposes, as further detailed below.
In the event that following the preliminary examinations of Non-personal Information as noted above, such user is determined as qualified to use the Service (as shall be determined in our sole discretion), then after clicking the Service button the User will be requested to fill out the registration form available on the Service, and such User will be required to provide certain information such as his/her contact details, e-mail address and password for the Service, the User’s credit card details, billing information and official proof of identity and address and any additional required information in order to render the Service. In addition by clicking on the Service button, you hereby agree that the Exchange shall transfer Personal Information needed for rendering the Service and that we may reuse such information provided by the Exchange or provided by you as described above in this section.
The User’s publicly-available social network information, provided that the User has an existing third-party social network account (namely, a Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google+ account) (“ SN Account ”) registered under the same name and/or e-mail provided by User when registering to the Service.
In the event a User registers to the Service or otherwise grants us with certain access permissions to his/her SN Account, the third-party social network(s) operating such SN Account(s) may provide us with certain information about the User, as is stored in and/or made available by the User through his/her SN Account and in accordance with the permissions granted to us by the User. For example, such information may consist, as applicable and/or made available by the User, of the User’s name, public profile picture URL address, SN Account User ID, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, occupation or work information, education and other information which the User made public.
The User’s credit rating and other information available through publicly available credit card black lists and official limited bank account lists.
Any Personal Information provided voluntarily by the User via its use of the Service, such as the User’s e-mail address in order to be contacted (and any additional information related to such contacts), transaction details provided through use of the Service, and/or other actions performed by the User in connection with the Service.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
