We have implemented appropriate safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and make proper use of the information we collect. However, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide to us.
Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates may also have access to and process your information. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential seller).
