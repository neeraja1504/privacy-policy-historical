What information do we collect and how is it used? Do we disclose information to third parties?
We may collect any or all of the following three types of information: (i) traffic or clickstream data, (ii) non-personally identifiable information (for example: IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity) ("Non-PII"). Our collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties or subsidiaries or affiliates of SimpleChase.com.

a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ("Clickstream Data"). Clickstream Data consists of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable. We do not supplement or combine Clickstream Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect with certain selected third parties and affiliated Entities, but only in anonymous form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third parties and affiliated Entities may combine such Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or affiliated Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream Data regarding use of our services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) you access. For example, our servers collect information about the site to which you may redirect to in order to enable us to calculate and receive payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream Data to better design our services.
(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.
