Use of Cookies and Other Technology. The Website uses “cookie” technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer or device. The Website uses Cookies to keep the information you enter on multiple pages together. The majority of the cookies that we use are “session cookies” that are automatically deleted from your hard drive after you close your browser at the end of your session. Session cookies are used to optimize performance of the Website and to limit the amount of redundant data that is downloaded during a single session. Simplyink also uses “persistent cookies” which remain on your computer or device unless deleted by you (or by your browser’s settings). We use persistent cookies for statistical analysis of the Website’s performance to ensure the ongoing quality of the services provided through the Website. We do not use cookies to obtain or retain any personal information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but web browsers can be set to block cookies (consult your browser’s instructions on how to block cookies). Please note that blocking cookies may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Website.
Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We connect the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

The Website may include third party tailored ad technology from our ad partners which enables customized ads to be displayed to you through the Website and that manages our advertising on other sites. We do not share personal information with these third parties; however, when you use the Website, we or our third party ad partners operating the ad serving technology may use non-personal information that is collected through cookies, anonymous identifiers, such as an IDA on iOS devices, web beacons, pixels or clear GIFs to ensure that appropriate ads are presented and/or to perform analytics concerning your use of the Website and other websites tracked by our ad partners.

To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties’ privacy policies and that Simplyink is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.

Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op. This website participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, which enables participating Adobe Marketing Cloud companies to better recognize their consumers across devices. Each participating company provides the Co-op with automatically collected technical information, such as cryptographically hashed login IDs and HTTP header information. Personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, phone number, etc.) is not shared with the Co-op. The Co-op combines and processes only technical information to recognize when multiple devices are used by the same individual and creates links among those devices. These device links are used by participating companies to link devices they have already seen visit their sites or advertising, and to provide consistent experiences and marketing activities across the devices. Personally identifiable information is not used in determining linked devices. You can learn more about how the Co-op works or opt-out of the Co-op by clicking here.
