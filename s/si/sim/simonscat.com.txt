This Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Company Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Company Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Company Service.
The Company Services are for a general audience, are not targeted at children, and do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16 years of age.
WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
The Company collects the following types of data from and about you:
Registration data is the information you submit to register for a Company Service (if made available by the Company), for example to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest. This data may include, for example, name, surname, email address, gender, country, postcode and age.
Public data and posts are comments or content that you post on the Company Services and the personal data about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public information and posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
Data from social media. If you access or log-in to a Company Service through a social media service or connect a Company Service to a social media service, the data we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any personal data you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Company Services through social media services or when you connect a Company Service to social media services, you are authorizing the Company to collect, store, and use such personal data and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Activity data. When you access and interact with the Company Services, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device. Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology commonly called Flash cookies ) may also be collected.

We do not collect:
Financial information from a payment service provider : in some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ( Payment Service ). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
