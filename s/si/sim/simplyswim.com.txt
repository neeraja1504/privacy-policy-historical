How do we use your personal information?

Communicate with you;
Request product reviews via our third party review system Okendo;

Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud and under some circumstances process age verification checks (for dangerous goods etc); and
When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services. Depending on whether you join our mail list without placing an order we also use our Marketing information for this purpose.
We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
