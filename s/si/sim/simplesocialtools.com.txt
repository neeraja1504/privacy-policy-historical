Privacy Policy
GDPR compliance
The EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018 and we are fully behind the spirit of these regulations for a safe and secure Internet.
We collect basic contact information to allow you access to our membership site. Typically this will include contact details like full name, email addresses, payment methods, etc... in order to support membership login, content access and other account management functions.
Overall, we aim for privacy by default: if data collection is not integral to the way our product works, then we won’t collect it.
At any time, you may request your information to be exported and sent to you for review, and we promptly honor any requests by you to have your information deleted and forgotten.

If you provide us with your email address or signup for our products and services, it will qualify you to receive emails from us about our products and services that you've signed up for, products, services or content we feel you may be interested in, occasional promotional emails, special discount offers and other important messages and announcements about our products and services.
We respect your privacy. We will never sell, rent, lease or give away your information (name, address, email, etc.) to any third party. Nor will we send you unsolicited email. We'll only send you emails related to our products and services.
But if you would like to unsubscribe from our email list and want to never hear from us again, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails and we’ll know that you're no longer interested in receiving emails from us.

We may also send you information about other products and services our company offers.
We will not sell, provide, or transfer you email address to others.
We may allow advertising to our customers, or engage in joint ventures, which result in your receiving advertisements from selected third parties.
General Privacy Policies
We respect your interest in your privacy and as a result we have created this informational disclosure.

Information Collected by our ISP
The hosting provider for this Internet site (as with any Internet site) has the ability to record various information, including domain name, pages accessed, date and time of access, web browser type and computer operating system, and referring information, and to disclose this information. This is most commonly done by providing access to raw server logs. For more information you should perform an Internet search on 'server logs' or 'raw server logs.' We may have access to our raw server logs and access reports prepared by our hosting provider.
Financial Information for Billing Purposes
We sell products and services. When sales are made financial information must be disclosed. This information can include any number of facts you are asked to provide, but most commonly includes your name, financial / credit card information, billing address, and email address. Generally, this purchase information will be provided by you to a third party payment processor and we do not receive your financial / credit card information.
In the event we do receive financial / credit card information, we will not disclose it to anyone unless disclosure is required by law or a court order, or unless disclosure is required to address an issue implicated by the financial transaction. If you claim that your financial information was used to make a purchase you did not authorize, details about the financial transaction may be disclosed to law enforcement and anyone else we deem necessary to address the matter.
