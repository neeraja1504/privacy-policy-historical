As part of the SimbaGames registration process, we ask for a number of personal details, including your first and last name, home and billing address as well as e-mail address and date of birth. We will need this information to open your account, to process transactions and for customer service purposes. Rest assured that under no circumstances will we pass on or sell these details to a third party. This information may also be used in conjunction with your private Username and Password to verify your identity. The only exception to this policy is if you have a big win - then we may use your username and/or first name for promotional purposes.
What are Cookies?
