We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18, nor do we knowingly distribute such information to third parties. If we become aware that we received personal information from someone under the age of 18, we will take steps to delete such information from our records.

Any information you shared in public areas of the Platform will remain in those areas until it is deleted in accordance with our data retention policy.
Device and Communications, Site Visit and Technical Information. When you access the Site through a web browser, we collect technical information that identifies your computer, software, browser settings and Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the web); network MAC address (a unique number that is assigned to your network card by the manufacturer); your AdID (the unique identifier assigned to you for advertising purposes); network operator; browser type and version; operating system and version; domain name; device's preferred language; country information configured in your browser; a randomly assigned, unique user identification number (UID) set by us; and/or other characteristics relating to your device, its software and the mode of communication with us; as well as information regarding your visit to the Site, such the date, time and duration of a visit, the specific webpages you visit, the links you click throughout the Site, and/or the external websites from which you arrived at the Site or to which you linked from the Site (see our Cookie Policy for more information). You may choose not to accept cookies using your browser. See our Cookie Policy for more information.
On many of our web and app forms, we utilize the Google reCAPTCHA v3 service to fight spam and abuse on our Platform, which is clearer noted by the presence of a badge image that appears in the bottom right corner of a user’s screen. For clarity, note that the use of these web and app forms that use the reCAPTCHA v3 service is also subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and Google's Terms of Use.
When you access the App using your mobile device, we collect the unique device ID number of the mobile device; the unique identifier assigned to your mobile device for advertising purposes, such as your Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) on iOS devices or your Google Advertising ID (AAID) on Android devices; your Bluetooth MAC address (a unique number that is assigned to your Bluetooth radio by the manufacturer); as well as information about your mobile device model, operating system and version, and/or mobile communications carrier.
General Location. When you use the Sites, we collect location data that is provided by your ISP or a third party data provider, such as your ZIP code, city and state. When you access the App using your mobile device, we collect the location data (such as your current latitude/longitude coordinates) that is provided by your mobile device (if you enable that feature on your device and choose to share your location with us).
Wi-Fi Services. We use Wi-Fi technologies and possibly at times Bluetooth (BLE) Beacons within our shopping centers that may communicate with your device and identify your device's location if your device is Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi enabled and you have these radio(s) on. The information collected includes the following: your device’s MAC Address, device manufacturer (such as Apple or Samsung), signal strength and, if your device is connected to a Wi-Fi network, the name of the network.
When you are near a Simon Wi-Fi network with a Wi-Fi enabled mobile device, our Wi-Fi access points (i.e., the hardware devices that allow a Wi-Fi enabled mobile device to connect to our Wi-Fi network) may automatically detect the presence of your mobile device and capture its “MAC Address” (meaning the number that your mobile device automatically broadcasts if the Wi-Fi feature is turned on to help it connect to Wi-Fi Access points). We refer to this information as “General Visit Information.” General Visit Information is collected identifying location as your mobile device moves across different shopping center locations that use this technology. For clarity, this information is automatically collected if your device’s Wi-Fi is enabled, even if you do not actually “connect” to a Simon Wi-Fi network.
Such data collection is done by both Simon directly, and via its vendors, which are currently AisleLabes, Inc. (“AisleLabs”) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco Meraki”). These vendors should treat such information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review both the AisleLabs privacy policy and the Cisco Meraki privacy statement.
In addition, when you register to use the Simon Wi-Fi network we provide at our shopping centers, you will be required to consent to our Wi-Fi Network Terms of Use and provide certain registration information. Registration information will include personally identifiable information (such as your name, e-mail address and/or mobile phone number). By consenting to the Wi-Fi Network Terms of Use, you agree to the following: (a) the sharing of registration information with third parties for the purposes described in this Notice and in AisleLabs privacy policy, including, without limitation, personalizing shopping experiences and improving business operations; (b) the linking of your registration information with your past, present, and future location data.
Mobile Location Analytics Opt Out. Simon complies with the Mobile Location Analytics Code of Conduct. As provided for in this code, you may elect to opt out of associating some General Visit Information about your presence at a location with a device’s MAC Address. If you choose to opt out, we will use your device’s MAC Address only to maintain the device’s opt-out status. For clarity, Simon, Cisco Meraki and AisleLabs may still collect and use (except for direct marketing purposes) your MAC Address. Please see AisleLabs privacy policy for more information.
You may adjust the settings on most devices to allow the Sites or App to gather, or to disable it from gathering, location positioning data. Certain features, such as a mall locator, may not work as effectively if you disable location positioning data.
Do Not Track. Do not track is a voluntary program among Internet advertisers that is intended to give users the ability to opt-out of interest-based advertising. There are a few ways in which your computer may transmit a "do not track" signal to certain websites and online services you visit, and currently no standard has been established. We do not respond to do not track signals, and the settings in your browser will have no effect on the Site.
Platform Operation. We use the information we collect to operate, maintain and improve the Platform and our products and services, such as to respond to comments and questions and provide customer service; send information including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages; communicate about promotions, upcoming events, and other products and services offered by us and/or by third parties, including through the use of contextual and interest-based advertising; link or combine the information we collect with other information we get from third parties, to help understand your interests and provide you with better service; or content, to improve our Platform, or to communicate with you regarding promotions, upcoming events, and other products and services offered by us and/or by third parties, including through the use of contextual and interest-based advertising; protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized or illegal activity; provide and deliver the products and services you request; identify you as a user in our system, such as when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect the Platform, customers, or other individuals; facilitate the creation of and secure any accounts you created on our Platform; develop and improve marketing and advertising for the Platform; and/or for other purposes in operating the Platform.
We may create de-identified information records and "aggregate data" reports about how users use the Platform, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Sites or the Apps, which may be derived from technical and/or personal information. This information cannot be readily tied back to you, your account, your web browser or your mobile device. We may use this de-identified information for business purposes, such as to enhance the content of and improve the Platform, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to ascertain how often individuals use areas of the Platform so that we may focus on and improve those areas.
We may use technical data we gather to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services while you are using the Platform.
We may use your mobile phone number for the purposes stated herein, including for mobile SMS/MMS messaging or content in accordance with our mobile text terms of use.
Location Information. We may use the location and Wi-Fi information gathered to generate reports, such as foot traffic at our malls, which we may share with retailers and third parties to improve the consumer experience at our malls, and in order to provide specific services, such as locating a nearby mall when you make such a request. We may also use this information to send you news about the mall, such as promotions from mall retailers, and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Third parties may process location data as service providers to us, such as to facilitate marketing campaigns or to perform fraud detection and analysis on our behalf. Please see additional information in Section 1.3, above, regarding third party use of information collected in connection with location-based information.
Advertising. We use analytics services, advertising companies, advertising networks and advertising exchanges to help analyze how users use and navigate the Platform and to engage in advertising on our behalf and on behalf of mall retailers, including contextual advertising, mobile geo-fence based advertising, re-targeting based advertising and interest-based advertising. These companies may use data about your visits to the Platform and other websites or mobile applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you which are offered by us or by our retailers. Those companies are instructed to follow industry guidelines with regard to interest-based advertising, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's principles for online behavioral advertising. Among other things, the ads that are displayed to you should have the AdChoices icon or a similar mechanism which you may click to direct you to a website where you may opt-out of interest-based advertising. If you would like more information about this practice and how to opt-out of receiving communications from these third-party advertising companies, please visit this link.
Some retailers may employ their own advertising campaigns via the Platform which adhere to differing practices. You may learn about a specific retailer's practices by reviewing that retailer's privacy policy.
Various data collected for advertising purposes may be restricted through cookies. See our Cookie Policy __ for more information.

Those parties with which we contract are required to maintain reasonable measures designed to safeguard the security of the data they process; however, we do not otherwise have control over and are not responsible for their handling of such data.
