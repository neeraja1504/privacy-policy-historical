SimplyMaya uses cookies to improve the website's usability. A cookie is a file containing an identifier that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.

Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on our website.
