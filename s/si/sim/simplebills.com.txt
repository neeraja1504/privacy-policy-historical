If your application to be serviced by SimpleBills is accepted, we will require a form of payment to keep on file. This form of payment may be a credit card, debit/ATM card, checking account, or savings account.
We may collection information not specifically mentioned above, if the information is required by a utility provider in order to set up an account. This information is usually secondary contact information and/or a social security number.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
