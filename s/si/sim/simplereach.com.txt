Website Privacy Policy — Nativo Native Platform
EU-wide data protection legislation known as the “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR” (a copy of which is posted here), has effect from May 25th, 2018. California data protection legislation known as the “California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018” has effect from January 1, 2020. The Website Privacy Policy is intended to meet our duties of Transparency under the GDPR, the CCPA and all other applicable privacy laws.
We will post any modifications or changes to this Website Privacy Policy on this page.
Who we are.
We are Nativo, Inc. We are a Californian company. Our address is: 100 N. Sepulveda Blvd., 10th Floor, El Segundo, CA 90245.
We have a UK subsidiary called Nativo London Limited. Its address is: 5 Margaret Street, 2nd Floor, London, UK W1W 8RG.
When we refer to “Nativo” , “we” or “us” in this Website Privacy Policy, we are referring to both ourselves and our UK subsidiary.
We have appointed a “Data Protection Officer”, this is a person who is responsible for overseeing and advising us in relation to our compliance with the GDPR and our compliance with this Interest Based Ads Privacy Policy. If you want to contact our Data Protection Officer directly, you can email: privacy@nativo.com.
What we do.
Nativo is an advertising technology provider. Our technology facilitates campaign planning, buying, management, delivery, optimization, measurement and analytics for advertisers and agencies and enables publishers to build, upload, host, serve, render and report on campaigns delivered to their web and mobile app properties.
Cookies.
The Website uses cookies, pixels, beacons and similar technology placed by us or third parties. The cookie we set (the “Nativo Cookie”) is a ‘persistent’ browser cookie. This means the Nativo Cookie remains on your device even after you close out of your browser or turn off your device. Nativo uses this Nativo Cookie and other similar technologies to help us store basic information about a user of the Website. This enables us to identify account holders, to optimize user experience on the Website, and to learn from and improve the Nativo technology and services, based on user behavior. Cookies may also be used by our third-party providers to track how you use the Website to target ads to you on other websites.
To be able to do the above, we need to collect:
A unique identifier (which is resettable) assigned to a particular cookie (a “Cookie ID”); and
information about your logged-in status, key value records and reference data regarding your interaction with the Website and our technology infrastructure and tools (collectively, “Passive Data”).
Effect of clearing your Cookies.
If you clear your cookies, it will delete the Nativo Cookie and therefore the Cookie ID will no longer identify a cookie on your device. This means the next time you visit the Website (unless you actively identify yourself by logging in), we will not recognize you or your device, we will treat you as an entirely new user we have never seen before and we will set the Nativo Cookie (together with a new Cookie ID) again.
Expiry date of the Nativo Cookie.
The Nativo Cookie expires within 30 days following the time at which you last visited the Website.
What "Your Rights" are.
Opt out of Targeted Advertising
Nativo is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Codes of Conduct. You may use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of receiving tailored online ads from Nativo and from other NAI members.
Reset your Cookies.
You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility).
As noted above, if you clear your cookies, it will delete the Nativo Cookie and therefore the Cookie ID will no longer identify a cookie on your device. This means the next time you visit the Website (unless you actively identify yourself by logging in), we will not recognize you or your device, we will treat you as an entirely new user we have never seen before, and we will set the Nativo Cookie (together with a new Cookie ID) again.
