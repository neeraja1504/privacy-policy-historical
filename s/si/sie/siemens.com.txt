Siemens Cookie  Notice
This Cookie Notice applies to the present website operated by the Siemens company referred to under “Corporate Information.”
Status: August 2016
When you visit Siemens websites, information is stored on your terminal device in the form of a "cookie." Cookies are small files that are stored on your terminal device and save certain settings and data to exchange with our websites via your browser.
For example, cookies enable us to tailor a website to better match your interests or to store your password so that you do not have to re-enter it every time. As a general rule, we never collect personal data via cookies, unless you have given us your express permission to do so.
If you do not want us to recognize your terminal device, please configure your Internet browser to erase all cookies from your device, to block all cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You will find brief instructions on how to do this below.
Please note that certain functions of our website may no longer work, or not correctly, without cookies.
Types of cookies
Cookies can be assigned to four categories, depending on their function and intended purpose: absolutely necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and cookies for marketing purposes.
Absolutely necessary cookies
are needed for you to navigate within Siemens websites and operate basic website functions, such as the issuance of anonymous Session IDs for bundling several related queries to a server.
Performance cookies
collect information on the usage of our websites, including for example the Internet browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the website which you previously visited, the number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages called up.
These cookies do not store any information that would make it possible to personally identify the user. The information collected with the aid of these cookies is aggregated and is therefore anonymous. Performance cookies serve the purpose of improving the user friendliness of a website and therefore enhancing the user’s experience. You can block the use of such cookies by creating an exclusion cookie (see “managing cookies” below).
Functional cookies
enable a website to store information the user has already entered (such as user ID, language selection, or the user’s location), in order to offer improved, personalized functions to the user. Functional cookies are also used to enable requested functions such as playing videos and to make a user’s decision to block or disable a certain function (e.g. web analysis) - “opt-out cookies”.
Cookies for marketing purposes
are used to offer more relevant content to users, based on their specific interests. They are also used to limit the display frequency of an ad and to measure and control the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They register whether users have visited a website or not, and which contents were used. This information may possibly also be shared with third parties, such as advertisers, for example. These cookies are often linked to the functions of third-party websites. You can block the use of such cookies by creating an opt-out cookie (see “Managing cookies” below).
Managing cookies:
Please note: Not all of the cookies mentioned below will necessarily be used when you browse our website using a mobile terminal device.
Performance cookies: Adobe Analytics
We use Adobe Analytics on our website for the purpose of constantly improving the website and/or detecting errors. For this purpose, Adobe Analytics anonymously stores and analyzes various kinds of data, including the visited website and the website’s metadata, websites that link to Siemens, the time of the visit, and the browser used.
Please click here to prevent Adobe Analytics from aggregating and analyzing the data collected from your visit to this website. By doing this, you will create a so-called exclusion cookie in your browser. It contains no personal data, but technically enables Adobe Analytics to permanently recognize your preference.
If you delete this exclusion cookie or if you change your computer or web browser, you will need to create the exclusion cookie again.Cookies for marketing purposes.

By doing this, you will create a so-called exclusion cookie in your browser. It contains no personal data, but technically enables Adobe/Siemens to permanently recognize your Preference.
Adobe Media Optimizer
We sometimes run online advertisement campaigns that display advertisements (“ads”) to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests based on your use of our websites and applications, or from other companies and websites that we work with to help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “online behavioral advertising.” We use Adobe Media Optimizer (“AMO”) to display our ads on websites across the Internet. For this purpose several cookies will be set in your browser allowing both AMO and so-called ad exchanges to recognize your terminal device based on anonymous identifiers and to thus show you ads tailored to your likely interests. Please click here to prevent AMO from aggregating and analyzing the data collected from your visit of this website (web viewing data) and serving you tailored ads shown on other websites based on your activity on our websites and online services. If you opt out, you may still see our ads on other companies’ websites, but they will not be specifically tailored to you based on your activity on our websites and online services. In addition you may also opt out from the collection of web viewing data for interest-based advertising by some or all of the companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance on the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice page.
Xaxis
We permit the company Xaxis (a division of GroupM Competence Center GmbH, Derendorfer Allee 10, 40476 Düsseldorf), to place cookies on our websites that collect information on usage-based online advertising; this is also known as “targeting.”
For this purpose, Xaxis collects and stores anonymized data on our website. The cookie stored on your computer collects information about your activities on the websites you have visited (e.g., surfing behavior, sub-pages visited, ad banners clicked, etc.). Based on this data, Xaxis generates profiles that do cannot be used for personal identification, meaning that you as the user cannot be personally identified; in particular, the IP address you use is not stored.
Your computer is then identified for ad delivery purposes and assigned to a target group. This information makes it possible to display advertising that is more relevant to you on the websites of other providers.
You will find additional information on the technology used on our website and on data privacy at the following link: http://www.xaxis.com/page/privacy-policy
