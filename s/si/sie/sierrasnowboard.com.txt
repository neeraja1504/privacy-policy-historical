Secure Transactions
Information such as credit card numbers is secure and safe. You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the form over the Internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information. The security features offered by your web browser technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes through the Internet. With Secure Socket Layer (SSL) implemented on both your browser and ISP server, your Internet communications are transmitted in an encrypted form. Information you send can be trusted to arrive securely and privately to the server you specify and no other. SSL uses authentication and encryption technology. For example, your browser's export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a High-grade, 128-bit key size. The encryption established between you and a server remains valid and in place over multiple connections, yet any illegal attempts to defeat the encryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the encryption of the next message. Your browser and secure servers deliver server authentication using signed digital certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities. A digital certificate verifies the connection between a server's public key and the server's identification (just as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph and your personal identification. Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted. You can tell when you have a secure connection by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. You can also verify the security of a document by examining the security icon in the bottom-left corner of the browser window. Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt your information. In transit, the information is meaningless and unreadable. An intermediary can continue to route the data, and even make copies of it, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains private and safely communicated.
