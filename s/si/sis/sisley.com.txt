a) Source of the information and type of information processed
The personal information processed by BENETTON is gathered directly from Site users when they register for offered services (such as the newsletter or the online shop). Simple navigation of the Site, without subscribing to any of the online services, may entail the acquisition of information in a completely anonymous way. The Site uses cookies to gather information on how consumers use the web pages. Information (such as the type of browser being used, if you have clicked on a Benetton banner, the nationality of the server used by the computer) is gathered through cookies in order to make site navigation more efficient.

The data controller is Benetton Group S.r.l. with headquarters in Ponzano Veneto (Treviso) at Via Villa Minelli no. 1.
c) Purposes of data processing
The personal information gathered from registration forms for Site services and/or any information that may be obtained as part of the website navigation process, including sensitive data that may come into BENETTON’s possession through the customer’s initiative in relation to specific operations that are arranged or particular services requested by the customer (such as subscribing to the Newsletter) will be processed for the following purposes: (i) fulfilment of obligations provided for by laws, regulations, EU regulations, and instructions set forth by authorities and supervisory bodies; (ii) management and execution of the precontractual and/or contractual relationship with customers/users in Italy as well as within or outside the European Union by loading the provided information into the computer systems of BENETTON and its subsidiaries/affiliated companies (hereinafter referred to collectively as “Benetton Group”); (iii) communication of information and commercial promotions, also through automated systems, telephone, SMS, MMS and email, regarding the offer of BENETTON products and services, as well as for market research, surveys and customized or statistical analysis, also through electronic processing, of the information obtained following navigation of the Benetton website and through other services offered by Benetton in order to send commercial information based on consumer choices and listed preferences, using the methods mentioned above.

e) Mandatory/optional nature of providing information
Providing information is not mandatory. Nevertheless, failure to provide the information listed on the form to register for services or other personal information that may be requested for the purposes of the contractual relationship may make it impossible for BENETTON to establish and/or continue, wholly or in part, the contractual relationship or to provide the requested services.

Personal information may be communicated to: (i) other companies in the Benetton Group (when the information is loaded into the company computer system); (ii) outside companies that BENETTON may use to manage the contractual relationship with customers or for its own organizational and business needs, which may be specialized in: (a) banking, financial and insurance services, including parties involved in payment system management; (b) services for the acquisition, registration and processing of data; (c) activities for the printing, transmission, placement in envelopes, transport and distribution of communications; (d) services for filing documentation regarding contractual relationships; (e) debt collection services; (f) IT services and management of the Benetton computer system and of telecommunications networks (including email); (g) assistance and consultancy firms or companies; (h) parties that perform the control, auditing and certification of activities set up by BENETTON; (i) call centres and agencies and/or agents commissioned to promote Benetton’s goods and services; (l) market analyses and communication services to propose commercial offers, including customized offers. These parties will process customers’ personal information as independent data controllers (as in the case of Triboo Digitale S.r.l., which manages the e-commerce site) or may be informed of the data as outside data supervisors when specifically appointed to do so pursuant to Article 29 of the Code.
