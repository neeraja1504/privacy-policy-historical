In order to be eligible for prizes, users must have practised themselves on Siyavula Practice.
Redoing the same question repeatedly will disqualify the user from any prize draws.
Only Learners and Teachers on the Siyavula Practice platform are eligible for prizes.
The closing date for an entry is midnight (SAT) on 31 October 2018. Winners will be selected in a random drawing from all eligible entries received by the closing date and throughout The Period.
Should the prize winner not respond to messages (email, SMS, Siyavula inbox, and/or Facebook inbox) within 1 month of being notified of a prize, Siyavula reserves the right to disqualify the prizewinner from that particular prize.
Users have to opt into (agree to) being listed on #1MillionMaths leaderboards in order to be eligible for prizes; eligibility for prizes is not automatic.
Leaderboards
The leaderboards for users are generated automatically by the Siyavula Practice system.
No correspondence will be entered into for disputing or calling into question the position of any user on the leaderboard
