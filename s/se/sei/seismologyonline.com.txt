Cookies Policy -Information Traffic collects from you
A. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online Traffic Online.JLT flows.
Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Traffic Online.JLT website features.
Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
During the course of any visit to the Traffic Online.JLT website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
B. How does Traffic Online.JLT use cookies?
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example: if on a previous visit you went to our services pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight certain service information on your second and subsequent visits.
Traffic Online.JLT also operates measurement and research trials. We gather information regarding the visitors to Traffic Online.JLT sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. Traffic Online.JLT uses this type of information to help improve the services we provide to our users. Traffic Online.JLT strictly require that third parties do not use any information for their own business or other purposes. Certain other areas of the Traffic Online.JLT site may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to help an online element work effectively on your device. If this is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.

Traffic Online.JLT won't contact you for marketing purposes, or promote new services to you unless you specifically agree to be contacted for these purposes.
