Customer relationships at Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. ("JHA") are built on trust. You have chosen to do business with JHA, and we guard that relationship with great care, beginning with the information you have chosen to share with us.
JHA is dedicated to respecting and protecting your privacy. We maintain information about you in order to provide you with the most effective and convenient access to our broad range of products and services. We want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and protect it. This notice serves as a standard for all JHA employees for collection, use, retention and security of nonpublic personal consumer information. In accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, this section details how we deal with any information collected through this site.
Our Security Procedures maintain the security of our customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to persons who need to know that information to provide you products or services. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard information.
You may visit JHA's Web site without revealing your identity or any personal information. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you through the use of "cookies" or by any other secret means. The only information we retain is the information you explicitly provide us when you fill out a form, sign up for service on this or other JHA Sites or other JHA services. We also keep track of the domains from which people visit us for internal analysis of trends and statistics, although this information is not linked to you personally.
Furthermore, we only use the information you provide for the purpose you originally intended. For example, if you sign up to receive JHA announcements via electronic mail, we will retain your personal information for the sole purposes of transmitting announcements to you. And except as required by law or court order, we will not release any information provided by you to any third party.
