We'll always keep your personal data secure. To help you understand it, here's why we need it and how we use it.
1. General
1.1 HK Optics Limited trading as “Select Specs” (“we” or “us”) take the privacy of your information very seriously. Our Privacy Notice is designed to tell you, the user of our services about our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information which may be provided to us via our websites, associated apps and other digital products we provide or collected through other means such as an online form, email, or telephone communication.
1.2 This notice applies to personal data provided by our users, whether they are a customer for our products or otherwise. In this notice “you” refers to any individual whose personal data we hold or process (other than our staff).
1.3 In this notice references to the “Site” are references to any website, app or other means by which you provide personal data to us or access our services.
1.4 This privacy policy is a notice governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) from 25 May 2018.
2. Basis on which we process personal data
2.1 Personal data we hold about you will be processed either because:
2.1.1 the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”, a legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or a third party has in processing your personal data which is not overridden by your interests in data privacy and security;
2.1.2 you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes described in this notice; or
2.1.3 the processing is necessary in order for us to comply with our obligations under a contract between you and us.
