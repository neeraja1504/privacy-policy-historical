Privacy Policy
Privacy and Security Policy
Effective May 25, 2018
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY (hereinafter referred to as “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) CAREFULLY. THIS POLICY DESCRIBES THE WAYS Deserve, Inc. (formerly known as SelfScore or Tremus, Inc. and also referred herein as “we”, “us”, “our”) OR OUR VENDORS COLLECT, PROTECT, USE AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. YOU ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY BY USING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY “SERVICES”) ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH ANY OTHER MEANS. We may amend this Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website (“the Site”). We will attempt to give a reasonable notice period upon making any changes; however, unless otherwise stated, the revised version will be effective at the time we post it.
By using our Services you are consenting to our processing of your Personal Information and data as set forth in this Policy now and as amended. As used herein, “processing” means using or accessing information in any way, including but not limited to collecting, storing, deleting, combining, and disclosing information. Our servers are located in the United States. Accordingly, if you reside outside the U.S., by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States and processed and stored in the United States. By using our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
Our Services contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of every website you visit.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT — To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Use by this reference.

Information You Give Upon Registration
If you desire to apply for the Deserve Credit Card or access certain parts of the Services, you will be required to become a registered user and to submit certain Personal Information to Deserve.com. Personal Information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth and other information that you decide to provide us with as part of the credit card application. Additionally, we may request that you upload a copy of your travel passport/national identity card, a copy of your financial statement issued by a US bank, and/or a copy of your US I-20 Form and US Student Visa which are issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in order to verify your identity, program eligibility, and ability to repay debt. We may also ask our users to generate a new personal identification number (PIN) or password to access our Services. In general, we may use any information provided by you to verify your identity or as part of a credit application or other business processes.
Information Deserve Learns From Your Use
When you visit the Deserve website or use the Services, we may collect information from your computer, mobile phone, or any other device. This information may include your IP address and device information including but not limited to identifier, device name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information, and standard web log information such as your browser type, traffic to and from our website, the pages you accessed on our website, and any other available information. We may also collect information about your use and interaction with our website, application, or Services. For example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone, or other access device for indicators of fraud, or analyze your website clicks to assess your interest in our specific product terms. When you use our Services, we may also store information based on your usage history. This includes but is not limited to details of your purchases, content you viewed, event information, referring sites or click stream information, and web “cookies” or “tokens” that may uniquely identify your browser, device, or your account. We may also collect information about you from any contact you have with any of our employees, our customer support team, or through surveys, or through interactions with our agents and/or affiliates.
Location Data
Deserve.com may receive varying degrees of location information from Social Media Services (as defined below) that you enable within our Service and also (with your permission) from your computing devices (“Location Data”). For example, we may collect and use location data (e.g. GPS or IP-based geography detection) to screen for fraudulent activity or to verify self-reported information (for example, to verify you reside in a certain city or near a university in which you are enrolled) and to customize the Service to make it more relevant to you (for example, to send newsletter information that may be of interest to you).
Server Log Data
When you interact with the Site or use our Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information (“Log Data”). This Log Data is collected passively and may include (but is not limited to) information such as your IP address, browser type, mobile phone type, software settings/configurations, or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. We use Log Data and analytics-based observations to provide you with the Services (for example, to send an SMS to your mobile device) and we may pool Log Data with other information to monitor the use of the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. If we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, then we will associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, according to our Terms of Use and/or applicable law.
Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers
Like many websites and services, we also may use “cookie” technology to collect additional Site usage data and to improve the Site and Services and related offers. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. Deserve may use both session cookies and persistent cookies (known as “persistent tokens”) to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. A session cookie or security token enables certain features of the Site and Services and is often (but not always) deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent token will likely remain after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent tokens can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
We may, or our Partners or Affiliates may, also deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks (and other websites) to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
Payment Information
Deserve or its Partners or Vendors may collect payment information such as a valid credit card number, type, and expiration date, or other financial information such as a routing & account number for check payments. Payment information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable Terms of Use and privacy policy. Our payment processor is CoreCard (www.corecard.com)
Bank Access/Login Credentials
Prior to establishing a Deserve account or after a Deserve account is established, or both, we invite Deserve credit card holders to enter certain login credentials (such as a username and password) for certain online account types (for example, credit cards, debit cards, or traditional bank accounts) in order to verify identity.  This thereafter provides Deserve with persistent access to the financial account. Deserve uses the access to measure and assess a card holder’s ability to repay debt or counter fraud.
Contacts Information
If you permit Deserve to access the contacts/address book on your phone or other services (such as email) through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and execute our referral program. Access to contacts may be requested as part of a customer referral program or validation of self-reported information.
Credit Card Transaction Information
We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, locations, distance travelled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your customer referral code, then we may associate your name with that person.

In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Deserve often conducts research on our customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and Deserve may share this aggregated data with our marketing affiliates, agents, and business partners. This aggregated information does not identify you personally. Deserve may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
Information Obtained From Third Parties
