What information do we collect?
Search 4 Career Colleges collects personally identifiable information you voluntarily choose to disclose, and "aggregate information" that is automatically collected when you visit the web site.
Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are and is collected when you choose to request information from a school that is listed on the site. This information can include your name, current e-mail address, programs of interest and other information you choose to provide. If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may retain your e-mail address and messages together with our responses.
Aggregate information is automatically provided by your computer and cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include:
referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after the web site)
date and time of your visits
pages viewed and time spent at the web site
browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform)
Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer on the Internet
Cookies
Search 4 Career Colleges uses cookie technology to allow us to deliver customized information to you and track which site features are most popular. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. In addition, your computer may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. Search 4 Career Colleges does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies, but doing so may impact the functioning of parts of the Search 4 Career Colleges site.
How do we use the personal information that you provide to us?
Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you specified do become available. We also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making other products and services available to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to the web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.

Tell a Friend
We take the privacy of our users very seriously, and as such, no information from the Tell a Friend link is logged at any time.

The e-mail sent is immediate, the information is not passed along to our server and no data is kept for comparison purposes. Because of this, it is possible to receive more than one e-mail from our site, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
