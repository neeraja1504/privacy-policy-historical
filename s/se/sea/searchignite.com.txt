WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?
Personal Information is information that identifies you as an individual. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided by us (for example, to sign up to be a customer or to register for a webinar), we may require that you furnish Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Please note that some jurisdictions such as the EU define Personal Information more broadly.
Non-Personal Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you, including your IP address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, demographic data (for example your country), as well as information collected through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site and our services. We and our third party service providers may also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other person, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the number of customers we have in a particular state.
Cookies. We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and similar technologies on this Site. We use them to conduct analytics that help us understand how our Site is being utilized so that we can make it better. We also allow third parties to place cookies and collect Non-Personal Information. Some of these third parties provide functionality such as social networking or sharing functionality on the Site. Other third parties help us conduct Site analytics. While still other third parties may help collect information to be used to target advertising as described below. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. You can also delete the cookie we set for you. To learn more about cookies, please visit  http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive information through email. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).

To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.
Opt-Out. If you no longer wish to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, or if you would prefer that we do not share Personal Information about you on a going-forward basis with our affiliates for our affiliates’ marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related emails or from such sharing by sending an email containing your request to  privacy@ignitionone.com.

Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such affiliates, please contact such affiliates directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.
Do Not Track. A number of industry groups are attempting to develop a Do Not Track (DNT) standard. Currently, the standards regarding the DNT signals and appropriate responses are not defined. Accordingly, we do not assign a meaning to DNT signals.
Accessing, Changing or Suppressing Personal Information. If you would like to access, change, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us, you may contact us by sending an email containing your request to  privacy@ignitionone.com. IgnitionOne acknowledges that EU and Swiss individuals have the right to access the Personal Information that we maintain about them.  An EU or Swiss individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to  privacy@ignitionone.com.  For your protection, we will only implement such requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. If you’re located in the EU, scroll down to see any additional rights you may have.
In each event, you must clearly indicate the information that you wish to have changed or suppressed or clearly indicate the limitations you wish to put on our use of your Personal Information. We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed therefrom.

Special Data Protections for EU Data Subjects. As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) will afford additional rights to EU data subjects. Those rights include the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and the right to access, correct and delete certain personal data processed by IgnitionOne by visiting our  EU data subject access request page. Moreover, with respect to EU data subjects, Personal Information includes pseudonymous data such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID. We process certain Personal Information provided by Clients and partners under contractual necessity. For example, we require the billing details of our Clients located in the EU to process payment for the Services. We collect contact details from EU data subjects via our Website with consent and ask for consent for our Website to place cookies onto EU desktops. Where consent is our legal basis for processing, we endeavor to make it just as easy to withdraw consent as it is to provide consent. Where IgnitionOne receives from an EU data subject a request to cease processing of data via one of the choice mechanisms listed above, IgnitionOne will stop all data processing with respect to the opted out browser or device unless such processing is required by law. The retention period for data from EU data subjects will be based on the specific data collected and the purpose of processing such data.  IgnitionOne’s data protection officer and EU Representative is Cedric Brosens and he may be contacted at  Cedric.Brosens-ext@ignitionone.com.
