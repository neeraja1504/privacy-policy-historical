SearchMan Privacy Policy
Last updated: 05/29/12
The SearchMan service (the “Service”) located at http://SearchMan.com/ and https://SearchMan.com/ (collectively, the “Site”) is operated by AppGrooves, Corp.  AppGrooves Corp. is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy.  To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe our information gathering and dissemination practices and our data protection practices for the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline AppGrooves sites, products or services.  The terms “AppGrooves,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to AppGrooves and its affiliates. The terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to the user utilizing the Service or the Site.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the SearchMan Terms of Service located at http://SearchMan.com/s/doc/tos.html (the “TOS”), and capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the TOS.
Collection of Information
Here's what we collect from you when you use the Service:
·       User-Provided Information: When you use or subscribe for the Service, we may ask you to provide certain information, including information that is considered "personally identifiable information” (that is, information that would allow us to directly identify you, such as your name, your company name, and email address). This information is necessary to provide our Service for your app and improve the SEO of your app in the App Store.  If you elect to subscribe to the full functionality and features of the Service, you will be prompted to provide financial information, including credit card and other billing information, which will be passed directly to a secure third party credit card payment processing service to process and charge your monthly subscription fee.  The credit card payment processor will not share your financial information with us and we will not store any such information on our servers.  We will not ask for more information than is necessary to operate the Service.
·       "Automatically Collected" Information:  When you use the Site or Service we may automatically record certain information about your use from your web browser such as your IP address. This information is used for our internal research purposes, to accommodate the Site to our users’ preferences and needs.
·       "Cookies" Information:  One form of "automatically collected" information we record is information stored by "cookies." When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies to your computer. We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser when you later return to the Service), persistent cookies generally can be removed. You can review the appropriate "Help" file in your Web browser or your mobile device to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. We will use the information collected to improve user experience on the Site by customizing features to our users’ preferences.

Security
We make efforts to protect personally identifiable information in our possession from loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, unauthorized access, and destruction. AppGrooves takes reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information, including using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software in certain cases, which encrypts certain of the information you input. While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us in all cases and certain unauthorized third parties may gain access to and misuse your information despite our security efforts.
The servers in which we store information are primarily located in the United States, but in times of emergency or for other business reasons, from time to time such information may be sent by us or our service providers to servers outside of the United States.
