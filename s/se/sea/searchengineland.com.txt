Privacy Policy - Third Door Media
Updated 7/3/18
We want to protect your privacy. In order to operate, our web sites and business operations may gather information about you. These terms explain how this may happen, what we will do with any potentially personal information and how you can get in contact should you have any concerns.
What Information We Collect
Third Door Media collects your information when you register for any of the content or services offered by our brands, Marketing Land, Search Engine Land, MarTech Today, MarTech Conference, Search Marketing Expo, Digital Marketing Depot, and our third-party sponsors. Our content or services include newsletters, premium content, webcasts, video, white papers, research, conferences and events
Personally Identifiable Information Collected
The personal information we ask for is limited to what can be found on a typical business card:
__your name
__your job title
__your employer/company name
__your work email
__your work phone
__your work address
We may also ask you to provide additional information about your job role, company, or industry.To enhance and/or update the information that you have provided, we may combine it with professional and company information from third party sources. The personal information that we refer to in this document is the information you provide, as well as information that we may obtain from third party sources, both of which we typically combine as one user record.Even if you do not register with us, our sites collect and store certain information automatically using cookies and similar technologies, including IP addresses, the region or general location of a computer or device accessing the internet, browser type, operating system, page view history, and other usage information. You can read more about this in the Cookies and Web Beacons section below.
Cookies & Web Beacons
Third Door Media, its advertisers or analytics partners may send a cookie to your computer or use web beacons to gather statistical information. A cookie does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to know that a particular web browser was used to visit our sites. A web beacon does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to automatically send information about pages and content used to an analysis tool.Cookies and web beacons allows us to understand things such as whether a particular web browser is spending much time on our sites, visiting several times per month and other types of analysis. If you never provide us with personally identifiable information, then your visits – despite us using cookies or web beacons – are anonymous. We don’t know the actual person linked with the cookie. It’s like having a library card but never having to provide your name, address or phone number to check out books. The books are checked out by someone using a particular library card number, but who owns that number isn’t known. If you do provide personally identifiable information, then potentially we could link that with your cookie, then gather the visits with web beacons and understand how you personally have acted when visiting our web site.Advertisers may also use cookies and web beacons to ascertain how many times you’ve seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our web sites. Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn’t cause a problem with our sites, should you so choose. If you do encounter a problem, please let us know.
