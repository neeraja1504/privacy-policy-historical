Search engine workshops: Our Privacy Policy.
Search Engine Workshops
What personally identifiable information is collected on this site?
Visitors may supply personally identifiable information (such as name, address or telephone numbers) for various purposes on this site. These purposes include registering to receive e-mail newsletters, requesting further information about our workshops or services, or simply asking a question about Search Engine Workshops (SEW). SEW does not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.
How is it used?
When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for only that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to receive information or register for a workshop. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.
Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we use personally identifiable information, SEW will post the changes to our use of personally identifiable information on our site at least 30 days prior to a change.
Security
Personally identifiable information is stored on our Web server and is not publicly accessible. Further, personally identifiable information is only accessed by SEW employees on a "need to know" basis. SEW uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure.
Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

What anonymous information is collected on this site?
Anonymous clickstream information is collected for every visitor to this site. This includes pages viewed, date and time, and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. We do not make any association between this information and a visitor's identity.
How is it used?
We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
