Activation
What this feature does
Activation reduces software counterfeiting, which helps ensure that Microsoft customers receive the software quality they expect. Once your software is activated, a specific product key becomes associated with the PC (or the hardware) on which your software is installed. This association prevents the product key from being used to activate the same copy of the software on multiple PCs. Some changes to your PC hardware or software might require you to reactivate Windows. Activation can detect and disable activation exploits (software that circumvents or bypasses Microsoft software activation). If an activation exploit is present, a software or hardware vendor might have tampered with genuine Microsoft software in order to create counterfeit copies of the software. Activation exploits may interfere with the normal operation of your system.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
During activation, the following info is sent to Microsoft:
The Microsoft product code (a five-digit code that identifies the Windows product you're activating).
A channel ID or site code that identifies how the Windows product was originally obtained. For example, a channel ID or site code identifies whether the product was originally purchased from a retail store, obtained as an evaluation copy, obtained through a volume licensing program, or pre-installed by a PC manufacturer.
The date of installation, and whether the installation was successful.
Information that helps confirm that your Windows product key hasn't been altered.
PC make and model.
Version information for the operating system and software.
Region and language settings.
A unique number called a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) assigned to your PC.
Product Key (hashed) and Product ID.
BIOS name, revision number, and revision date.
Hard drive volume serial number (hashed).
The result of the activation check. This includes error codes and information about any activation exploits and related malicious or unauthorized software found or disabled:
The activation exploit's identifier.
The activation exploit's current state, such as cleaned or quarantined.
PC manufacturer's identification.
The activation exploit's file name and hash, as well as a hash of related software components that may indicate the presence of an activation exploit.
The name and a hash of the contents of your PC's start-up instructions file. If your Windows license is on a subscription basis, information will also be sent about how your subscription works. Standard computer information is sent as well.
If you’re using a volume licensed copy of Windows that uses an activation server, the IP address of that server may be sent to Microsoft.
Use of information
Microsoft uses the information to confirm that you have a licensed copy of the software. Microsoft doesn't use the information to contact individual consumers. License server information is used to ensure that license servers comply with their license agreements.
Choice and control
Activation is required and occurs automatically while you set up Windows. If you don't have a valid license for the software, you won’t be able to activate Windows.

Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) Client
What this feature does
Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) Client is information-protection technology that works with AD RMS enabled apps to help safeguard digital information from unauthorized use. Owners of digital information can define how recipients use the information contained in a file, such as who can open, modify, print, or take other actions with the file. In order to create or view a file with restricted permissions, your PC must be running an AD RMS enabled app and have access to an AD RMS server.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
AD RMS uses your email address to identify you to an AD RMS server. As a result, your email address is stored on the server, and on your PC in licenses and identity certificates created by the server. Identity certificates and licenses are transferred to and from AD RMS servers when you attempt to open, print, or perform other actions on a document protected by rights management. If your PC is connected to an enterprise network, the AD RMS server is typically operated by the enterprise. If you're using Windows Live AD RMS services, the server is operated by Microsoft. To help protect your privacy, information that is sent to Microsoft AD RMS servers is encrypted.
Use of information
The license allows you to access protected files. The identity certificates are used to identify you to an AD RMS server, and allow you to protect files and to access protected files.
Choice and control
AD RMS features must be enabled through an AD RMS-capable app. By default, they aren’t enabled. You can choose to not enable or use them. However, if you don’t enable them, you won’t be able to access protected files.

Advertising ID
What this feature does
To provide more relevant advertising, Windows allows apps to access a unique identifier for each user on a device. You can reset or turn off access to this identifier at any time.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you allow apps access to the advertising ID, Windows will provide it to all apps that request it. Apps might store or transmit this information.
Use of information
Your advertising ID is used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising to you by understanding which apps you use and how you use them. It can also be used by app developers to improve quality of service by allowing them to determine the frequency and effectiveness of ads and to detect fraud and security issues.
If you allow apps to access the advertising ID, each app’s use of the identifier is subject to that app’s privacy practices.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, Windows will allow apps to use your advertising ID. If you choose to customize settings, you can control access to your advertising ID by selecting Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps under Share info with Microsoft and other services. After setting up Windows, you can change this setting in Privacy in PC settings. If you turn this setting off, the advertising ID is not sent to apps that request it. If you choose to turn the setting on again, a new identifier will be generated.

Audit
Audit allows an administrator to configure Windows to record operating system activity in a security log that can be accessed using the Event Viewer and other apps. This log can help an administrator detect unauthorized access to the PC or resources on the PC. For example, this log can help administrators troubleshoot problems and determine whether someone has signed in to the PC, created a new user account, changed a security policy, or opened a document.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Administrators determine what information is collected, how long it is retained, and whether it is transmitted to other parties. The information might include personal information, such as user names or file names. For more information, contact your administrator. No information is sent to Microsoft.
Use of information
Administrators also determine how the audit information is used. Generally, the security log is used by auditors and administrators to track PC activity or to identify unauthorized access to the PC or resources on the PC.
Choice and control
Administrators determine whether this feature is turned on and how users are notified. Other users can’t view the security log unless the administrator allows them to access it. You can configure Audit on your PC by opening Local Security Policy in Administrative Tools.

BitLocker Drive Encryption
What this feature does
BitLocker Drive Encryption helps protect your data by encrypting it, which can help prevent an unauthorized user from accessing your data. When BitLocker is enabled on a supported drive, Windows encrypts the data on the drive.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
When BitLocker is enabled using software encryption, cryptographic keys in memory continually encrypt and decrypt data as it is read from or written to the protected drive. When BitLocker is enabled using hardware encryption, data encryption and decryption is performed by the drive.
During BitLocker setup, you can choose to print a recovery key or save it to a location on your network. If you set up BitLocker on a non-removable drive, you can also save your recovery key to a USB flash drive.
If your PC isn't joined to a domain, you can back up your BitLocker recovery key, recovery key ID, and computer name to MicrosoftOneDrive. To help protect your privacy, the information is sent encrypted via SSL.
You can set up BitLocker to encrypt data using a certificate stored on a smart card. When you protect a data drive using a smart card, the public key and unique identifier for the smart card are stored unencrypted on the drive. This information can be used to locate the certificate that was originally used to generate the smart card’s encryption certificate.
If your PC has security hardware with at least version 1.2 of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), BitLocker uses the TPM to provide hardware-enhanced data protection for the drive on which Windows is installed. For more information, see the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Services section. On TPM-equipped PCs, you can also set up a personal identification number (PIN) to help add an extra layer of protection for your encrypted data. BitLocker will store this TPM-based PIN in a hashed and encrypted form on the drive.
Information collected by BitLocker isn't sent to Microsoft unless you choose to back up your recovery key to OneDrive.
Use of information
Cryptographic keys and globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) are stored in PC memory to support BitLocker operations. BitLocker recovery information allows you to access your protected data in case of hardware failures and other problems. This recovery information allows BitLocker to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users.
Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose. When recovery keys are sent to OneDrive, Microsoft might use aggregate data about them to analyze trends and help improve our products and services.
Choice and control
By default, BitLocker is turned off. On a removable drive, any user can turn BitLocker on or off at any time by opening BitLocker Drive Encryption in Control Panel. An administrator can turn BitLocker on or off for all drives.
You can view and manage the recovery keys stored in your OneDrive account.

Contacts
What this feature does
If you use the People app or a supported third-party app to manage your contacts, you can choose to share specific contacts with other apps on your PC, display contact info in a contact card, or share specific contact info with other apps on your PC to perform an action, such as making a call or mapping an address.
Information collected, processed, stored, and transmitted
When an app requests contact info, Windows lets you choose specific contacts to share with the app. Contacts can come from the People app or a supported third-party contacts app. Windows does not share your entire list of contacts with the requesting app.
If an app has access to a piece of information about one of your contacts, such as a phone number or email address, Windows can show a contact card with the additional info from your contacts app for that contact. Windows doesn’t share the additional contact info to the app displaying the contact card.
If you tap or click a command such as Call , Email , or Map on the contact card, Windows opens the appropriate app to complete that action and provides that app with the contact details necessary to complete the action, such as providing the phone number to make a call.
Use of information
Windows uses the contact info from your contacts app to share specific contacts that you choose, to display contact cards, to open apps and share contact info to complete actions listed on the contact cards, and to show your contacts in Windows Search. The People app’s use of information about your contacts is described in the Communication apps privacy statement.
If you share contact info with a third-party app, how the app uses the info is subject to the third party’s privacy practices. If you share contact info with a Microsoft app, the app’s privacy practices will be explained in the app’s privacy statement.
Choice and control
Windows only displays and shares contact info when you choose to share specific contacts with an app, display a contact card, or select an action from the contact card.

Location services
Windows location services let you decide which apps, websites, and Windows features you want to allow to determine your PC’s location. Windows location services consist of two components. Windows Location Provider connects to a Microsoft online service to determine your location. Windows Location Platform determines your PC’s location using hardware, such as a GPS sensor, or software, such as Windows Location Provider.
Windows Location platform
What this feature does
If you choose to turn on the Windows Location Platform, apps you install from the Windows Store, as well as some Windows features, can ask for permission to determine your PC’s location. If you let an app use your location, in addition to providing your location while you use the app, Windows Location Platform can tell the app when your PC moves inside or outside of app-defined geographical boundaries. For example, an app could let you set a reminder to pick up groceries when you leave work. Depending on your system’s configuration, the Windows Location Platform may determine your PC’s location using hardware, such as a GPS sensor, or software, such as Windows Location Provider.
Windows Location Platform doesn’t prevent apps from determining your PC’s location in other ways. For example, you can install devices (such as a GPS receiver) that might send location information directly to an app and bypass the platform. Regardless of your Windows Location Platform settings, online services can use your IP address to determine its approximate location—usually the city your PC is in.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
The Windows Location Platform itself doesn’t transmit any information from your PC, but individual Location Providers (such as the Windows Location Provider) might transfer information when Windows Location Platform asks them to determine your PC’s location. Apps, websites, and features that are authorized to use the platform to determine your PC’s location could also transmit or store that information. If an app sets up geographical boundaries to monitor, those boundaries are stored encrypted on your PC. The information stored about these boundaries includes a name, a location, and whether your PC was inside or outside the boundary the last time its location was determined. Apps that set up geographical boundaries might transmit or store this information
Use of information
If you turn on the Windows Location Platform, authorized apps, websites, and Windows features will be able to access your PC’s location and use it to give you personalized content. If you use a third-party app or Location Provider, its use of your PC’s location is subject to the third party’s privacy practices. Before you download a Windows Store app, you’ll be able to see whether the app is location aware in the app description.
Choice and control
By choosing express settings during Windows Setup, you turn on the Windows Location Platform. If you choose to customize settings, you can control the Windows Location Platform by selecting Let Windows and apps request my location from the Windows Location Platform under Share info with Microsoft and other services. The first time each Store app requests your PC’s location, Windows will ask whether you want to allow the app to use your location. You can view and change this setting for each Store app in Permissions in the app’s settings.
If you use a desktop app that uses Windows Location Platform, it should ask your permission to use your PC’s location, and when it accesses your PC’s location, an icon will appear in the notification area to let you know that your PC’s location has been accessed. Each user can control their own location settings for apps in Privacy in PC settings. In addition, administrators can choose to turn off the location platform for all users in Location Settings in Control Panel. To prevent apps from being notified when geographic boundaries defined by apps are crossed, an administrative user can turn off the Windows Location Framework Service in Control Panel.
Windows Location Provider
What this feature does
The Windows Location Provider connects to the online Microsoft Location Service, which helps determine your PC’s approximate location based on Wi‑Fi networks near your PC and your PC's IP address.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
When an app you’ve authorized to receive your location requests it, the Windows Location Platform will ask all installed Location Providers (including Windows Location Provider) to determine your PC's current location. The Windows Location Provider will first check to see if it has a stored list of nearby Wi‑Fi access points from a prior request made by a location-aware app. If there isn't already a list of nearby Wi‑Fi access points, or the list is out of date, the provider sends information about nearby Wi‑Fi access points and GPS information (if available) to the Microsoft Location Service. The service returns your PC’s approximate location back to the provider, which passes the location to the Windows Location Platform, which in turn provides it to the app that requested your PC's location. Windows Location Provider may also update its stored list of Wi‑Fi access points. The Windows Location Provider maintains this list so it can determine your PC’s approximate location without connecting to the Internet each time. This list of access points is encrypted when stored on disk so that apps can't directly access it.
The information that's sent about nearby Wi‑Fi access points includes BSSID (the MAC address of the Wi‑Fi access point) and signal strength. The GPS information includes observed latitude, longitude, direction, speed, and altitude. To help protect your privacy, Windows Location Provider doesn’t send any information to uniquely identify your PC beyond the standard computer information sent with all connections to the Internet. To help protect the privacy of Wi‑Fi network owners, Windows doesn’t send information about SSIDs (Wi‑Fi access point names) or hidden Wi‑Fi networks. For privacy and security purposes, information sent about Wi‑Fi networks is sent encrypted via SSL.
If you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service, Windows might send information about nearby Wi‑Fi access points to Microsoft again after an app has requested your PC’s location. If you’re using a metered Internet connection, Windows will limit the number of times per day it sends this information to limit the use of your Internet connection.
Use of information
The information is used by the Windows Location Provider to give Windows Location Platform the approximate location of your PC when an authorized app requests it.
If you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service, the Wi‑Fi and GPS info sent to Microsoft is used to improve Microsoft’s location services, which in turn helps to improve the location services provided to your apps. Microsoft doesn't store any data collected from this service that could be used to identify, contact, target advertising to you, or to track or create a history of your PC’s location.
Choice and control
The Windows Location Provider is used only if an authorized app has requested your PC's location. For more info about how to control whether apps can request your PC's location, see the Windows Location Platform section. If you authorize apps to request your PC's location, the cached list of nearby Wi‑Fi access point locations that are encrypted and stored by the Windows Location Provider will be deleted and replaced periodically.
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, you choose to help improve the Microsoft Location Service. If you choose to customize settings, you can control whether to help improve the Microsoft Location Service by selecting Send some location data to Microsoft when location-aware apps are used under Help improve Microsoft products and services. After setting up Windows, you can change this setting in Location Settings in Control Panel. If you choose not to help improve the service, you'll still be able to use the Windows Location Provider to determine your PC’s approximate location.
You can turn the Windows Location Provider on or off by opening Turn Windows features on or off in Control Panel. If you turn off the Windows Location Provider, you can still use other Location Providers (such as GPS) with the Windows Location Platform.

Name and account picture
What this feature does
To provide personalized content, apps can request your name and account picture from Windows. Your name and account picture are displayed under Your account in Accounts in PC settings. If you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows will use the name and account picture associated with that account. If you haven’t chosen a picture for your account, your account picture will be a default picture provided by Windows.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you allow apps to access your name and account picture, Windows will provide that information to all apps that request it. Apps might store or transmit this information.
If you sign in to Windows with a domain account, and you choose to allow apps to use your name and account picture, apps that can use your Windows credentials will be allowed to access certain other forms of your domain account information. This information includes, for example, your user principal name (like jack@contoso.com) and DNS domain name (like corp.contoso.com\jack).
If you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, or if you sign in to Windows with a domain account connected to a Microsoft account, Windows can automatically sync your account picture on your PC with your Microsoft account picture.
Use of information
If you use a third-party app, how the app uses your name and account picture is subject to the third party’s privacy practices. If you use a Microsoft app, the app’s privacy practices will be explained in its privacy statement.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, Windows will allow apps to access your name and account picture. If you choose to customize settings, you can control access to your name and account picture by selecting Let apps use my name and account picture under Share info with Microsoft and other services. After setting up Windows, you can turn change this setting in Privacy in PC settings. You can change your account picture in Accounts in PC settings.

Network awareness
What this feature does
If you have a subscription plan for network access (for example, via a mobile broadband connection), this feature provides information about your subscription plan to apps and Windows features on your PC. Windows features and apps can use this information to optimize their behavior. For example, if you’re on a metered data plan, Windows Update will wait to deliver lower priority updates to your PC until you’re connected to another type of network. This feature also provides information about your network connection, such as signal strength and whether your PC is connected to the Internet.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
This feature collects Internet and intranet network connectivity information, such as the Domain Name Service (DNS) suffix of your PC, network name, and gateway address of the networks that your PC connects to. This feature also receives subscription plan information such as the amount of data remaining in the plan.
Network connectivity profiles can include a history of all networks visited and the date and time of the last connection. This feature can attempt to connect to a Microsoft server to determine whether you're connected to the Internet. The only data sent to Microsoft during network connectivity checks is standard PC information.
Use of information
If data is sent to Microsoft, it is only used to provide network connectivity status. Network connectivity status is made available to apps and features on your PC that request network connectivity information. If you use a third-party app, use of the information collected will be subject to the third party's privacy practices.
Choice and control
Network Awareness is on by default. An administrator can turn it off using the Services options in Administrative Tools in Control Panel. Disabling this feature isn't recommended because it will prevent some Windows features from functioning properly.

Notifications, lock screen apps, and tile updates
Windows Store apps can automatically receive content and display notifications in several ways. They can, for example, receive notifications that are displayed briefly in the corner of the screen or on app tiles if those tiles are pinned to Start. You can also receive those notifications on the lock screen if you’d like. The lock screen can display detailed or brief status for certain apps as well. App publishers can send content to your Windows Store apps through the Windows Push Notification Service running on Microsoft servers, or the apps can download information directly from third-party servers.
Notifications
What this feature does
Windows Store apps can deliver periodic or real-time information to you that will be displayed briefly as notifications in the corner of the screen.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Apps can display text, images, or both in notifications. The contents of notifications can be provided locally by the app (for example, an alarm from a clock app). Notifications can also be sent from an app's online service through the Windows Push Notification Service (for example, a social network update). Images displayed in notifications may be downloaded directly from a server specified by the app publisher; when that happens, standard computer information will be sent to that server.
Use of information
Microsoft only uses notification information to deliver notifications from your apps to you. The notification can be stored temporarily by the Windows Push Notification Service before delivery to your PC. If a notification can’t be delivered immediately, it will only be stored for a few minutes before it’s deleted.
Choice and control
You can turn off notifications for all apps or for individual apps in Notifications under Search & apps in PC settings. If you turn off notifications for an app or uninstall it, the app publisher could still send updates to the Windows Push Notification Service, but those notifications won’t display on your PC.
Lock screen apps

Remote Desktop connection
What this feature does
Remote Desktop connection provides a way for you to establish a remote connection with a host PC that is running Remote Desktop Services.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Remote Desktop connection settings are stored in app-local storage or in a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file on your PC. These settings include the name of your domain and connection configuration settings, such as remote PC name, user name, display information, local device information, audio information, clipboard, connection settings, remote app names, and session icon or thumbnail.
Credentials for these connections, Remote Desktop Gateway credentials, and a list of trusted Remote Desktop Gateway server names are stored locally on your PC. A list is stored in the registry. This list is stored permanently unless it is deleted by an administrator. No information is sent to Microsoft unless the remote connection is hosted by Microsoft.
Use of information
Information collected by Remote Desktop connection allows you to connect to host PCs running Remote Desktop Services using your preferred settings. User name, password, and domain information are collected to allow you to save your connection settings and to enable you to double-click an RDP file or click a favorite to launch a connection without having to re-enter this information.
Choice and control
You can choose if you want to use Remote Desktop connection. If you use it, your RDP files and Remote Desktop connection favorites contain information required to connect to a remote PC, including the options and settings that were configured when the connection was automatically saved.

Sign in with a Microsoft account
What this feature does
A Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID) is a single email address and password you can use to sign in to apps, sites, and services from Microsoft and select Microsoft partners. You can sign up for a Microsoft account in Windows or on Microsoft websites that require you to sign in with a Microsoft account.
You can sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account or, on products that support it, choose to connect your local or domain account to a Microsoft account. If you do this, Windows can help make your PCs look and feel the same by automatically syncing settings and info in Windows and Microsoft apps. If you visit a website where you use a Microsoft account to sign in, Windows will also sign you in to that website automatically.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
When you enter an email address to use as a Microsoft account while setting up your PC or in Accounts in PC settings, Windows sends the email address to Microsoft to determine if there’s already a Microsoft account associated with that email address. If you already use that email address as a Microsoft account, you can use it and the password for the Microsoft account to sign in to Windows. If you don’t already have enough security info for your Microsoft account, we might first ask you for additional security info such as a mobile phone number that we can use to verify the account is yours. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, you can create one using any email address.
When you sign in with a Microsoft account, Windows will also send standard computer information to Microsoft, including your device’s manufacturer, model name, and version.
Each time you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account while your PC is connected to the Internet, Windows verifies your email address and password with Microsoft’s servers. When you're signed in to Windows with your Microsoft account or with a domain account connected to your Microsoft account:
Certain Windows settings will sync between the PCs that you sign in to with your Microsoft account. For more info about what settings are synced and how to control them, see the "Sync settings" section of this page.
Microsoft apps that use a Microsoft account for authentication (like Mail, Calendar, People, Microsoft Office, and other apps) can automatically begin downloading your info (for example, the Mail app will automatically download the messages sent to your Outlook.com or Hotmail.com address if you have one). Web browsers can automatically sign you in to websites that you sign in to with your Microsoft account (for example, if you visit Bing.com you might be automatically signed in without needing to enter your Microsoft account password).
Windows will ask your permission before allowing third-party apps to use profile information or other personal information associated with your Microsoft account. If you sign in to Windows with a domain account connected to a Microsoft account, the settings and info you choose will sync with your domain account, and you’ll automatically be signed in to apps and websites as described above. Because domain administrators are able to access any information on your PC, they'll also be able to access any settings and info you've chosen to sync with other PCs through your Microsoft account. This can include settings such as name, account picture, and browser history. For more info about what settings are synced and how to control them, see the "Sync settings" section of this page.
Use of information
When you create a new Microsoft account in Windows, we use the information you provide to create and help secure the account. For example, the security info you provide (like your phone number or alternate email address) is only used if you can’t sign in to your account. When you’re signed in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows uses your Microsoft account info to sign you in to apps and websites automatically. To learn more about the privacy impact of having a Microsoft account, read the Microsoft account privacy statement. For info about how individual Microsoft apps use information associated with your Microsoft account, see the privacy statements for each app. You can find the privacy statement for a Microsoft app by opening Settings from within the app, or in the About dialog.
Standard device information may be used to personalize certain communications to you, such as emails intended to help you get started with your device.
Choice and control
When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, some settings are synced automatically. To learn how to change which Windows settings are synced or to stop syncing, see the "Sync settings" section of this page. To learn more about the data collected by Microsoft apps that use a Microsoft account for authentication, read their privacy statements.
On products that support it, you can create a local account or Microsoft account at any time in Accounts in PC settings. If you sign in to Windows with a domain account, you can connect or disconnect your Microsoft account at any time in Accounts in PC settings.
When you use InPrivate Browsing in Internet Explorer, you won’t be automatically signed in to websites that use Microsoft accounts.

Sync settings
What this feature does
When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows syncs some of your settings and info with Microsoft servers to make it easier to have personalized experiences across multiple PCs. After you’ve signed in to one or more PCs with a Microsoft account, when you sign in to another PC with the same Microsoft account for the first time, Windows will download and apply the settings and info you choose to sync from your other PCs. Settings you choose to sync will automatically update on Microsoft servers and your other PCs as you use them.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you choose to sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows syncs certain settings with Microsoft servers. These settings include:
The layout of your Start screen
Apps you’ve installed from the Windows Store
Language preferences
Ease of Access preferences
Personalization settings such as your account picture, lock screen image, background, and mouse settings
Settings for Windows Store apps
Spell checker dictionaries, IME dictionaries, and personal dictionaries
Web browser history, favorites, and websites you have open
Saved app, website, and network passwords
Addresses of shared network printers that you've connected to
To help protect your privacy, all synced settings are sent encrypted via SSL. Some of these settings won't sync on your PC until you add your PC to your Microsoft account as a trusted PC.
If you sign in to Windows with a domain account connected to a Microsoft account, settings and info you've chosen will sync to your domain account. Passwords that you save while signed into Windows with a domain account connected to a Microsoft account will never be synced. Because domain administrators can access any information on your PC, they'll also be able to access any settings and info you've chosen to sync with other PCs through your Microsoft account.
Use of information
Windows uses these settings and info to provide the syncing service. Microsoft doesn't use your synced settings and info to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.
Choice and control
When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, your settings sync by default. You can choose to sync your settings, and control what is synced, by going to Sync settings in the OneDrive section of PC settings. If you sign in to Windows with a domain account and you choose to connect that account to a Microsoft account, Windows will ask which settings you want to sync before connecting your Microsoft account.

Teredo Technology
What this feature does
Teredo Technology (Teredo) allows PCs and networks to communicate over multiple networking protocols.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Each time you start your PC, Teredo will attempt to locate a public Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) service on the Internet. This occurs automatically when your PC is connected to a public or private network, but doesn’t occur on managed networks such as enterprise domains. If you use an app that requires Teredo to use IPv6 connectivity, or if you configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity, then Teredo will periodically contact the Microsoft Teredo service over the Internet. The only information sent to Microsoft is standard PC information and the name of the service requested (for example, teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com).
Use of information
The information sent from your PC by Teredo is used to determine if your PC is connected to the Internet and if it can locate a public IPv6 service. Once the service is located, information is sent to maintain a connection with the IPv6 service.
Choice and control
Using the netsh command line tool, you can change the query that the service sends over the Internet to use non-Microsoft servers instead, or you can turn it off. For detailed instructions, see the “Internet Protocol Version 6, Teredo, and Related Technologies” section of this technical white paper.

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Services
What this feature does
The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is security hardware built into some PCs that, if present and provisioned, enables your PC to take full advantage of advanced security features. Windows features that use the TPM include Device Encryption, Virtual Smart Card, Secure Boot, Windows Defender, and TPM Based Certificate Storage.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
By default, Windows takes ownership of the TPM and stores the full TPM owner authorization information so it’s only available to the Windows administrators. Limited authorization values are created to perform typical administrative actions and standard user actions and are managed by Windows.
The TPM Management Console allows you to interactively provision the TPM and save the TPM owner authorization value to external media like a USB flash drive after the TPM has been provisioned. A saved file contains the TPM owner authorization information for the TPM. The file also contains the PC name, operating system version, creation user, and creation date information to assist you in recognizing the file.
In a domain environment, the full TPM owner password can be configured by the domain administrator to be stored in Active Directory under a TPM object when the TPM is provisioned.
Each TPM has a unique cryptographic Endorsement Key that it uses to indicate its authenticity. The Endorsement Key can be created and stored in the TPM by your PC's manufacturer, or for older PCs, Windows might need to trigger creation of the Endorsement Key inside the TPM. The private portion of the Endorsement Key is never exposed outside of the TPM, and once it has been created, it usually can't be reset. An Endorsement Key Certificate will be stored in the TPM of most Windows computers. The Endorsement Key Certificate indicates that the Endorsement Key exists in a hardware TPM. The certificate is useful for remote verifiers to confirm the TPM conforms to the TPM specifications. The Endorsement Key Certificate is usually signed by the TPM manufacturer or the platform manufacturer.
Use of information
Once the TPM is initialized, apps can use the TPM to create and help secure additional unique cryptographic keys. For example, Device Encryption uses the TPM to help protect the key that encrypts the drive.
If you choose to save the TPM owner password to a file, the additional PC and user information saved inside this file helps you to identify the matching PC and TPM. The TPM endorsement key is used by Windows during TPM initialization to encrypt your TPM owner authorization value before sending it to the TPM. Windows doesn’t transmit cryptographic keys outside of your PC. Windows does provide an interface for third-party apps like antimalware software to use the Endorsement Key for certain TPM scenarios, such as Measured Boot with Attestation. For antimalware software the endorsement key and the endorsement key certificate also are useful to confirm boot measurements are provided by a TPM from a specific manufacturer. By default, only administrators or apps with administrative rights can use the TPM endorsement key.
Choice and control
Users or administrators opt in to using the TPM by turning on a Windows feature or running an app that uses the TPM.
You can choose to clear the TPM and reset it to factory defaults. Clearing the TPM removes owner information, and with the exception of the endorsement key, all TPM-based keys or cryptographic information that apps might have created when the TPM was in use.

Update Root Certificates
What this feature does
Certificates are used primarily to verify the identity of a person or device, authenticate a service, or encrypt files. Trusted root certification authorities are the organizations that issue certificates. Update Root Certificates contacts the online Windows Update service to see if Microsoft has added a certification authority to its list of trusted authorities, but only when an app is presented with a certificate issued by a certification authority that isn't directly trusted (a certificate that isn't stored in a list of trusted certificates on your PC). If the certification authority has been added to the Microsoft list of trusted authorities, its certificate will automatically be added to the list of trusted certificates on your PC.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Update Root Certificates sends a request to the online Windows Update service that asks for the current list of root certification authorities in the Microsoft Root Certificate Program. If the untrusted certificate is on the list, Update Root Certificates obtains that certificate from Windows Update and places it in the trusted certificate store on your PC. The information transferred includes the names and cryptographic hashes of root certificates.
Use of information
The information is used by Microsoft to update the list of trusted certificates on your PC. Microsoft doesn’t use this information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.
Choice and control
Update Root Certificates is turned on by default. Administrators can configure Group Policy to turn off the Update Root Certificates on a PC.

Update Services
What this feature does
Update services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update:
Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers supplied by device manufacturers.
Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software, as well as other Microsoft software such as Microsoft Office.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
The Update Services collect info from your PC that allows Microsoft to operate and improve the services, such as:
The Microsoft software and other supporting software (e.g., drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers) installed on your PC for which the update services have updates available. This helps us determine which updates are appropriate for you.
Your Windows Update and/or Microsoft Update configuration settings such as whether you want updates automatically downloaded or installed.
The successes, failures, and errors you experience when accessing and using the update services.
Plug and Play ID numbers of hardware devices – a code assigned by the device manufacturer that identifies the device (e.g., a particular type of keyboard).
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) – a randomly generated number that doesn’t contain any personal information. GUIDs are used to identify individual PCs without identifying the user.
BIOS name, revision number, vendor, and revision date – info about the set of essential software routines that test your hardware, start the operating system on your PC, and transfer data among hardware devices connected to your PC.
Manufacturer, Model, Platform Role, and SKU Number—information about the PC used to enable diagnostic investigations into driver installations.
You can use these Update Services by going to Windows Update in Control Panel and checking for updates or changing your settings to allow Windows to automatically install updates as they become available (recommended). Within the Windows Update feature, you can choose whether to opt in to Microsoft Update.
If you choose to get important software updates for your PC, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) might be included with these updates. MSRT checks PCs for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (“malware”) and helps remove any infections found. If the software runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific info about malware detected, errors, and other info about your PC. For more info, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement .
Use of information
The data sent to Microsoft is used to operate and maintain the Update Services. It is also used to generate aggregate statistics that help us analyze trends and improve our products and services, including the Update Services.
To generate aggregate statistics, the update services use the GUID collected by the Update Services to track and record the number of individual computers that use the Update Services, and whether the download and installation of specific updates succeeds or fails. The Update Services record the GUID of the computer that attempted the download and installation, the ID of the item that was requested, whether updates were available, and standard computer information.
The MSRT information described above is used to help improve our anti-malware and other security products and services. No information in the MSRT reports will be used to identify or contact you.
Required updates
If you turn on the Update Services, in order for them to properly function some software components on your system that make up or are directly related to the Update Services will need to be updated from time to time. These updates must be performed before the service can check for, download, or install other updates. These required updates fix errors, provide ongoing improvements, and maintain compatibility with the Microsoft servers that support the service.
If the Update Services are turned off, you won’t receive these updates.
Software updates required to install or update Windows Store apps will be downloaded and installed automatically. These updates must be performed for apps to function properly.
Cookies and tokens
A token is similar to a cookie. It stores information in a small file that is placed on your hard disk by the Update Services server, and is used when your computer connects to the Update Services server to maintain a valid connection. It is stored on your computer only, not on the server. This cookie or token contains information (such as last scan time) in order to find the most recently available updates. It contains information to manage what content should be downloaded to your computer, when that should happen, as well as a GUID to identify your computer to the server.
Information contained in the contents of the cookie or token is encrypted by the server (with the exception of the cookie or token expiration time). This cookie or token is not a browser cookie, so it cannot be controlled with your browser settings. The cookie or token cannot be removed; however, if you don’t use the Update Services, the cookie or token won't be used.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, the Windows Update service is turned on and set to install updates automatically.
If you turn on the Update Services, regardless of which setting you’ve chosen, required updates to some components of the service will be downloaded and installed automatically without further notice to you. If you’d prefer not to receive required updates, turn off the Update Services.
You can also choose whether to check for or automatically install Important and Recommended updates for your computer or Important updates only. Optional updates are never installed automatically. After setting up Windows, you can change your Windows Update settings in Control Panel or in PC settings.
If you’ve chosen to check for and install important updates, and receive MSRT as part of these updates for your computer, you can turn off the software's reporting functionality.

Virtual Private Networking
What this feature does
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) lets you connect to a private network, such as a corporate network, over the Internet. A VPN connection can be provided by the Windows VPN client, or by a third-party VPN app.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
When you connect to a VPN, the credentials you enter in the VPN client are sent to the remote network. You might be able to store these credentials on your PC. After you’re connected, depending on the way the VPN is configured, some or all of your network activity will be routed through the remote network. Administrators can configure specific apps to always route their traffic through the VPN, and to automatically connect to the VPN when those apps are launched. No information is sent to Microsoft.
Third-party VPN software may collect additional information; collection and use of this information is subject to the third party’s privacy practices.
Use of information
VPN clients use the credentials you provide to authenticate with the remote network, and to route network traffic to and from the remote network. If a third-party VPN client collects additional information, the third party’s use of that information is subject to the third party’s privacy practices.
Choice and control
You can add or remove a VPN connection, and see the status of existing connections, in Network in PC settings. After a VPN connection has been set up, you can manually connect or disconnect it by selecting the network from the list in Settings.

Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)
What this feature does
The Windows Customer Experience Improvement Programs (CEIP) can collect information about how you use your apps, your PCs, connected devices, and Windows. It can also collect information about performance and reliability problems that might occur. If you choose to participate in Windows CEIP, Windows will send this data to Microsoft, and will also periodically download a file to collect more relevant information about how you use Windows and apps. CEIP reports are sent to Microsoft to help improve the features our customers use most often, and to create solutions to common problems.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
CEIP reports can include information such as:
Configuration information, including how many processors are in your PC, the number of network connections in use, screen resolutions for display devices, and which version of Windows is on your PC.
Performance and reliability information, including how quickly an app responds when you click a button, how many problems you experience with an app or a device, and how quickly information is sent or received over a network connection.
App use information, including information such as how frequently you open apps, how often you use Windows Help and Support, which services you use to sign in to apps, and how many folders you typically create on your desktop.
CEIP reports can also contain information about events (event log data) on your PC from up to seven days prior to the time you decide to start participating in CEIP. Because most users decide to participate in CEIP within several days of setting up Windows, Microsoft uses this information to analyze and improve the Windows setup experience.
This information is sent to Microsoft when you're connected to the Internet. CEIP reports don’t intentionally contain contact information, such as your name, address, or phone number; however, some reports might unintentionally contain individual identifiers, such as a serial number for a device that is connected to your PC. Microsoft filters the information contained in CEIP reports to try to remove any individual identifiers that they might contain. If individual identifiers are received, Microsoft doesn’t use them to identify or contact you.
CEIP randomly generates a number called a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is sent to Microsoft with every CEIP report. The GUID lets us determine which data is sent from a particular computer over time. Some CEIP reports may also include GUIDs derived from your Microsoft account.
CEIP might also periodically download a file to collect more relevant information about the way you useWindows and apps. This file helps Windows collect additional information to help Microsoft create solutions for common problems and better understand usage patterns of Windows and apps.
Use of information
Microsoft uses CEIP information to improve our products and services, as well as third-party software and hardware designed for use with these products and services. We might also share aggregate CEIP information with Microsoft partners so they can improve their products and services, but the information can’t be used to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.
We use the GUID to distinguish how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between one customer experiencing a problem one hundred times and one hundred customers experiencing the same problem once. Microsoft doesn’t use the information collected by CEIP to identify or contact you.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, you turn on Windows CEIP: Windows and Microsoft apps from the Windows Store will be able to send CEIP reports for all users on your PC. If you choose to customize settings, you can control CEIP by selecting Send Microsoft info about how I use my PC, as part of the Customer Experience Improvement Program under Help improve Microsoft products and services. After setting up Windows, administrators can change this setting in Action Center in Control Panel.
For more info, see CEIP frequently asked questions.

Windows Defender
Windows Defender looks for malware and other potentially unwanted software on your PC. It includes the Microsoft Active Protection Service and History features.
Microsoft Active Protection Service
If you use Windows Defender, Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) can help better protect your PC by automatically downloading new signatures for newly-detected malware, and monitoring the security status of your PC. MAPS will send information about malware and other potentially unwanted software to Microsoft, and may also send files that could contain malware. If MAPS detects that your PC is infected with certain types of malware, MAPS might automatically contact you through your Microsoft account to help solve the problem.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
MAPS reports include information about potential malware files, such as file names, cryptographic hash, software publisher, size, and date stamps. In addition, MAPS might collect full URLs to indicate the origin of the files, as well as the IP addresses that the potential malware files connect to. These URLs might occasionally contain personal information such as search terms or data entered in forms. Reports might also include the actions you took when Windows Defender notified you that the potentially unwanted software was detected. MAPS includes this information to help Microsoft gauge how effectively Windows Defender can detect and remove malware and potentially unwanted software, and to attempt to identify new malware.
Reports are automatically sent to Microsoft when:
Windows Defender detects software that hasn’t been analyzed for risks yet.
Windows Defender detects changes to your PC by software that hasn't been analyzed for risks yet.
Windows Defender takes action on malware upon detection (as part of its automatic remediation).
Windows Defender completes a scheduled scan and automatically takes action on software that it detects based on your settings.
Windows Defender scans an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
If you choose to join MAPS while setting up Windows, you join with a basic membership. Basic membership reports contain the information described in this section. Advanced membership reports are more comprehensive and might occasionally contain personal information, for example, file paths and partial memory dumps. These reports, along with reports from other Windows Defender users who are participating in MAPS, help our researchers discover new threats more rapidly. Malware definitions are then created, and these updated definitions are made available to all users through Windows Update.
If you join MAPS, Windows Defender might send specific files or web content from your PC that Microsoft suspects might be potentially unwanted software. The sample report is used for further analysis. If a file is likely to contain personal information, you'll be prompted before it is sent. If Windows Update hasn't been able to obtain updated signatures for Windows Defender for a period of time, Windows Defender will attempt to use MAPS to download signatures from an alternate download location.
To help protect your privacy, all information sent to MAPS is sent encrypted via SSL.
To help detect and fix certain kinds of malware infections, Windows Defender regularly sends MAPS some information about the security state of your PC. This includes information about your PC’s security settings and log files describing the drivers and other software that load while your PC starts. A number that uniquely identifies your PC is also sent.
Use of information
Reports sent to MAPS are used to improve Microsoft software and services. The reports might also be used for statistical, testing, or analytical purposes, and for generating definitions. MAPS doesn’t intentionally collect personal information. To the extent that MAPS might unintentionally collect any personal information, Microsoft won’t use the information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.
The information about your PC’s security state that MAPS collects is used to determine if certain kinds of malware have infected your PC. In this case, Microsoft uses the contact information in your Microsoft account to contact you with details about the problem and how to fix it.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, you turn on MAPS. If you choose to customize settings, you can control MAPS by selecting Get better protection from malware by sending info and files to Microsoft Active Protection Service when Windows Defender is turned on under Share info with Microsoft and other services. After setting up Windows, you can change your MAPS membership or settings, including turning off MAPS, in the Settings menu in Windows Defender.
If you receive the Malicious Software Removal Tool through Windows Update, it might send similar information to MAPS even if Windows Defender is turned off. For more information, read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool .
History feature
What this feature does
The History feature provides a list of all apps on your PC that Windows Defender detects and the actions that were taken when the apps were detected.
In addition, you can view a list of apps that Windows Defender doesn’t monitor while they are running on your PC (these are called allowed items). You can also view apps that Windows Defender prevents from running until you choose to remove them or allow them to run again (these are called quarantined items).
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
The list of software that Windows Defender detects, the actions that you and other users take, and the actions that Windows Defender takes automatically are stored on your PC. All users can view the history in Windows Defender to see malware and other potentially unwanted software that has attempted to install itself or run on the PC, or that has been allowed to run by another user. For example, if you learn about a new malware threat, you can check the History to see if Windows Defender has prevented it from infecting your PC. No information is sent to Microsoft.
Choice and control
History lists can be deleted by an administrator.

Windows Error Reporting
What this feature does
Windows Error Reporting helps Microsoft and Microsoft partners diagnose problems in the software you use and provide solutions. Not all problems have solutions, but when solutions are available, they're offered as steps to solve a problem you’ve reported or as updates to install. To help prevent problems and make software more reliable, some solutions are also included in service packs and future versions of the software.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Many software products are designed to work with Windows Error Reporting. If a problem occurs in one of these products, you might be asked if you want to report it.
Windows Error Reporting collects information that is useful for diagnosing and solving a problem that has occurred, such as where the problem happened in the software or hardware, the type or severity of the problem, files that help describe the problem, basic software and hardware information, or possible software performance and compatibility problems. If you use Windows to host virtual machines, error reports sent to Microsoft might include information about virtual machines.
Windows Error Reporting also collects information about apps, drivers, and devices to help Microsoft understand and improve app and device compatibility. Information about an app might include the name of the app’s executable files. Information about devices and drivers might include the names of devices you’ve installed on your PC and the executable files associated with those devices’ drivers. Information about the company that published an app or driver might be collected.
If you choose to turn on automatic reporting while setting up Windows, the reporting service will automatically send basic information about where problems occur. In some cases, the reporting service will automatically send additional information to help diagnose the problem, such as a partial snapshot of PC memory. Some error reports might unintentionally contain personal information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of PC memory might include your name, part of a document you were working on, or data that you recently submitted to a website.
To help diagnose certain types of problems, Windows Error Reporting might create a report containing extra information, such as log files. Before sending a report containing this additional information, Windows will ask if you want to send the report, even if you’ve turned on automatic reporting.
After you send a report, the reporting service might ask you for more info about the problem that occurred. If you choose to provide your phone number or email address in this information, your error report will be personally identifiable. Microsoft might contact you to request additional information to help solve the problem you reported.
Windows Error Reporting randomly generates a number called a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is sent to Microsoft with every error report. The GUID lets us determine which data is sent from a particular computer over time. The GUID doesn’t contain any personal information.
To help protect your privacy, the information is sent encrypted via SSL.
Use of information
Microsoft uses information about errors and problems reported by Windows users to improve Microsoft products and services, as well as third-party software and hardware designed for use with these products and services. We use the GUID to determine how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between one customer experiencing a problem one hundred times and one hundred customers experiencing the same problem once.
Microsoft employees, contractors, vendors, and partners might be provided access to relevant portions of the information collected, but they’re only permitted to use the information to repair or improve Microsoft products and services, or third-party software and hardware designed for use with Microsoft products and services. If an error report contains personal information, Microsoft doesn’t use the information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.

Windows File Association
What this feature does
Windows File Association helps users associate file types with specific apps. If you try to open a file type and it doesn’t have an app associated with it, Windows will ask if you want to use Windows File Association to find an app for the file, which includes searching the Windows Store for a compatible app. Apps that are typically associated with the file name extension are displayed.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you choose to use Windows File Association, the file name extension (for example, docx or pdf) and your PC display language are sent to Microsoft. The rest of the file name isn’t sent to Microsoft. When a file association is made with a particular app, a unique identifier for the app is sent to identify the default app for each file type.
Use of information
When you submit a file name extension, the service returns a list of the apps that Microsoft is aware of that can open files of that extension. Unless you choose to download and install an app, no file type associations will change.
Choice and control
When you try to open a file type without an associated app, you can choose whether to use Windows File Association. No file association information is sent to Microsoft unless you decide to use the service.

Windows SmartScreen
What this feature does
Windows SmartScreen helps keep your PC safe by checking downloaded files and web content within apps to help protect you from malicious software and potentially unsafe web content. Before an unknown or potentially unsafe downloaded file is opened, Windows will display a warning. If SmartScreen detects potentially unsafe web content in an app, Windows will display a warning in place of the content.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you choose to use Windows SmartScreen to check downloaded files, Windows sends information to the SmartScreen online service This information might include a file name, file identifier (“hash”), and digital certificate information along with standard PC information and the Windows SmartScreen filter version number. To help protect your privacy, the information sent to Microsoft is encrypted via SSL.
If you choose to use Windows SmartScreen to block potentially unsafe content in apps, Windows sends information to the SmartScreen online service including the addresses and types of content that some Windows Store apps access when you use them. In response, the online service tells your PC whether the content has been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious. Reports sent to Microsoft include information such as the name or identifier of the app and the full addresses of web content accessed by the app.
To help protect your privacy, the information sent to Microsoft is encrypted. Information that might be associated with a webpage accessed inside an app, such as search terms, might be included in the address sent to Microsoft. For example, if you look up a word in a dictionary app, the word you look up might be sent to Microsoft as part of the full address accessed by the app. Microsoft filters these addresses to try to remove personal information where possible.
Windows generates a number called a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is sent to Microsoft with each report. The GUID lets us determine which data is sent from a particular computer over time. The GUID doesn’t contain any personal information.
Use of information
Microsoft uses the information described above to provide warnings to you about potentially unsafe downloaded files and content within apps. For example, if SmartScreen detects a potential threat inside an app that supports SmartScreen, Windows will display a warning in place of the content.

Windows Speech Recognition
What this feature does
Windows Speech Recognition provides speech recognition within Windows and for any apps that choose to use it. Windows Speech Recognition increases its accuracy by learning how you use language, including the sounds and words you like to use.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Windows Speech Recognition stores a list of words and their pronunciations on your PC. Words and pronunciations are added to this list using the Speech Dictionary, and by using Windows Speech Recognition to dictate and correct words.
When the Windows Speech Recognition document review feature is turned on, text from Microsoft Office Word documents (with doc or docx file name extensions) and email (from email folders other than Deleted items or Junk email) on your PC and on any connected file shares included in your Windows search index locations is collected and stored in one-, two-, or three-word fragments. One-word fragments include only words you have added to custom dictionaries, and two- or three-word fragments include only words found in standard dictionaries.
All collected information is stored in your personal speech profile on your PC. Speech profiles are stored for each user, and users aren’t able to access the profiles of other users on your PC. However, administrators can access any profile on your PC. The profile information isn’t sent to Microsoft unless you choose to send it when asked by Windows Speech Recognition. You can review the data before it is sent. If you choose to send this information, acoustic adaptation data that was used to adapt to your audio characteristics is also sent.
If you complete a speech training session, Windows Speech Recognition will ask you whether you wish to send your speech profile information to Microsoft. You can review the information before it’s sent. This information might include recordings of your voice while you completed the training session and the other information from your personal speech profile.
Use of information
Windows Speech Recognition uses words from the speech profile to convert your speech to text. Microsoft uses personal speech profile information to improve our products and services. We don’t use this information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.
Choice and control
You can choose whether to run Windows Speech Recognition. If you run Windows Speech Recognition, the document review feature is on by default. You can choose to change your document review settings the first time you run Windows Speech recognition. You can change your document review settings or delete personal speech profiles (and most document review information) by going to Speech Recognition in Control Panel and clicking Advanced speech options.

Windows Store
The Windows Store lets you find, manage, and install apps for your PC. The sections below describe how the Store’s features, and the apps you obtain through the Store, could impact your privacy, and what you can do to control that.
Store app and service
What this feature does
The Store lets you find and install apps for your PC. It also keeps track of the Store apps you’ve installed, so you can get updates for them and install them on more than one PC.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
To find and install apps, you must sign in to the Store with a Microsoft account. This gives the Store access to information in your Microsoft account profile, such as your name, email address, and account picture. The Store collects and associates the following additional information with your Store account:
Payments to the Store. Information about what you bought, how much you paid, and how you paid when buying apps or making in-app purchases with your Store account.
Apps you've installed. The list of apps you’ve installed from the Store, the license policy for each app (permanent license or limited-time trial), and a list of purchases you made with your Store account within each app. In addition to storing this information online with your Store account, the Store stores licensing information on your PC for each app you install. This information identifies you as the owner of the license.
PCs you've installed apps on. The make, model, and computer name of each PC you install apps on, along with a number that uniquely identifies the PC. This number is generated based on the PC’s hardware configuration, and doesn’t contain any information about you.
Ratings, reviews, and problem reports. Once you’ve installed an app, you can write a review or leave a rating for it in the Store. Your Microsoft account is associated with these ratings. If you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.
Store preferences. Preferences you set for viewing apps in the Store, such as whether to only display apps that are available in your native language.
You can choose to store your payment information, such as a credit card number, with your Store account. For security purposes, this information is transmitted over SSL, and all but the last four digits of your credit card number are stored encrypted.
The Store collects some information about your copy of Windows, to determine whether it was sold at retail, is an evaluation copy, is subject to a volume licensing program, or was preinstalled by your PC’s manufacturer. When you first connect to the Store, a list of all the apps preinstalled on your PC is sent to the Store, which then associates licenses for those apps with your Store account.
As you browse the Store and use apps from it, Microsoft collects some information to help us understand usage patterns and trends, similar to the way many websites analyze their visitors’ browsing data.
Use of information
Microsoft uses your contact information to send you email necessary to provide the Store services, such as receipts for apps you buy. It uses your payment information to let you pay for purchases; if you choose to store this information, you won't need to enter it every time. Microsoft uses information about your purchases to operate the Store and provide customer support.
The Store keeps track of all the apps you’ve installed. You can use the Store to manage the list of devices you’ve installed apps on, and customer support can also help you manage this information. Once you install an app, you'll always be able to see it in your Store purchase history, even if you choose to uninstall it. The Store also uses this list to help enforce the limit on the number of PCs you can install apps on, as described in the Windows Store terms of use. When you write a review for an app, the name and account picture associated with your Windows account will be published next to the review in the Store. If you report a problem with an app, the problem report is made available to Store representatives to assess and take action on. They might use your name and the email address associated with your Store account to contact you, if necessary, when they review the report.
When there are updates available to apps you’ve installed, a notification will display in the Store, and the Store’s tile will indicate the number of available updates. You can then view the list of available updates and choose which ones to install. Updated apps might use different Windows capabilities than the previous versions, which could give them access to different resources on your PC. You can see the updated lists of capabilities on the App Description pages linked to from the page listing available updates.
The Store uses the information it collects about your copy of Windows to determine how Windows was installed on your PC (for example, whether your PC’s manufacturer preinstalled it). This information allows the Store to let you access apps provided exclusively by that manufacturer for its customers. It is also used to provide information to Microsoft (and in aggregate to the manufacturer, in some cases) about Windows usage patterns.
Microsoft uses some app purchase and usage data in aggregate to learn how people use the Store (for example, how users find the apps they install). Microsoft might share some of these aggregate statistics with app developers. Microsoft doesn't share any of your personal information with app developers. We use the browsing and usage data collected by the Store to better understand how people use the Store, and to improve Store features and services.
Choice and control
If you choose to use the Store, the information described in this section will be sent to Microsoft as described above.
If you want to remove a review that you have published for an app, go to the app description in the Store, edit your review, and delete all the text.
Automatic app updates
What this feature does
This feature checks for, downloads, and installs updates to Windows Store apps to ensure that you have the latest versions. App updates may include security updates, performance updates, or new functionality or content. Updated apps might use different Windows capabilities than the previous versions, which could give them access to different resources on your PC. You can learn about capability changes on the Product Description Page for the app in the Windows Store.

You’ll see the features an app uses listed on its App Description page. If you install an app, Windows will allow it to use these features, except for location, text messaging, and webcam and microphone, which are considered especially sensitive. When an app requests access to one of these sensitive features for the first time, Windows will ask you whether you want to allow the app to use it. You can change whether the app can use it at any time.
In addition to the permissions above, if an app requests information from a device that stores information about you or your behavior, Windows will ask you whether you want to allow the app to use it. For example, if you connect a fitness device that tracks your location, Windows will ask if you want to allow the app to access it.
Use of information
Each app's use of these features will be subject to its developer's privacy practices. If an app uses one of the sensitive features described above, a link to the app publisher's privacy statement will be available on its App Description page in the Store.

Personalized Store search and app recommendations
What this feature does
When you browse or search for apps in the Windows Store, Microsoft provides recommendations and search results to help you find apps that are relevant to you.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
To help improve search results, Windows Store sends information to Microsoft about how you interact with it, including what you search for and what search results you select. Windows Store also sends an identifier associated with your Microsoft account to provide personalized search results based on your interactions with Bing and other Microsoft products and services. You can choose not to get personalized results, in which case the identifier won't be sent.
Use of information
The Store uses the identifier associated with your Microsoft account to provide personalized search results and recommendations based on your interactions with the Store and other Microsoft products and services, such as Bing and the Windows Phone Store. This includes information such as apps you’ve purchased, profile information you’ve provided in your Microsoft account, and your ratings and reviews of apps. This information may also be used to personalize other Microsoft products and services.
Choice and control
When you’re signed in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows Store personalized results and recommendations are turned on by default. You can choose not to get personalized results and recommendations from the Store in the Preferences section of Store settings.
Help improve the Windows Store by sending URLs for web content that apps use
What this feature does
Some apps you get from the Store are like websites and might expose your computer to potentially unsafe software, such as malware. If you choose to turn this feature on, it collects information about the web content used by these apps to help Microsoft diagnose potentially unsafe behavior. For example, Microsoft might use this information to remove an app from the Store.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If you choose to send information about the web content used by your apps, Microsoft will collect information about the URLs and types of content that these apps access when you use them. This can help us identify which of these apps are receiving content from harmful or unsafe websites. Reports sent to Microsoft include information such as the name or identifier of the app, the full URLs of addresses the app accesses, and full URLs that indicate the location of any JavaScript that the app accesses. Windows generates a number called a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is sent to Microsoft with each report. The GUID lets us determine which data is sent from a particular computer over time. The GUID doesn’t contain any personal information and isn’t used to identify you.
To help protect your privacy, the information sent to Microsoft is encrypted. Information that might be associated with a webpage that these apps access, such as search terms or data you entered into apps, might be included. For example, if you look up a word in a dictionary app, the word you look up might be included in the information sent to Microsoft as part of the full address accessed by the app. Microsoft filters these addresses to try to remove personal information where possible.
Use of information
Microsoft periodically reviews the information sent to help detect apps that might be interacting with unsafe web content, such as harmful web addresses or scripts. We might use this information to take action against potentially harmful apps. Addresses of web content can unintentionally contain personal information, but this information isn't used to identify, contact, or target advertising to you. We use the GUID to determine how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between potentially unsafe behavior occurring 100 times on a single PC, and the same behavior occurring once on each of 100 PCs.
Choice and control
If you choose express settings while setting up Windows, Windows will send information about the web content used by your apps from the Store built using JavaScript. If you choose to customize settings, you can control this setting by selecting Use SmartScreen online services to help protect against malicious content in sites loaded by Windows Store apps and Internet  Explorer, and in malicious downloads under Help improve Microsoft products and services. After installation, you can change this setting in Privacy in PC settings.

Windows Time service
What this feature does
The Windows Time service automatically synchronizes your PC's time with a time server on a network.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
The service connects to a time server over the Internet or a local network using the industry standard Network Time Protocol. By default, this service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week. No information other than standard PC information is sent to the time server.
Use of information
Information is used by the Windows Time service to automatically synchronize your PC's time.
Choice and control
The Windows Time service is turned on by default. You can turn this feature off in Date and Time in PC settings. Turning off Windows Time Service has no direct effect on apps or other services, but without a reliable time source, your PC’s clock might get out of sync with other PCs on the network or Internet. Apps and services that depend on time might fail or stop working correctly if there is a significant time discrepancy between networked PCs.
