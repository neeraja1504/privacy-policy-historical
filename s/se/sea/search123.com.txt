INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (?Sites?) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Search 123services.
?Log files? track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.
?Image requests? or ?web beacons? can transmit information used to track your data, which may include the navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behaviour. This information is written to cookies.
"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.
There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) ?Session Cookies? are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) ?Persistent Cookies? remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.
There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Search 123 does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.

PROCESSING AND STORING YOUR DATA
Data Processing
The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (?US?). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (?Safe Harbor?) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor.
By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the US and you agree to (i) permit us to transmit and use your user Information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to better improve the services and transactions provided by Search123; and (ii) that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
Security.
Search123 employs appropriate measures to ensure the security of all Information and we routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.

As a result, we reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time and shall post such changes on the Website. Our Website will state the date the Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use this Website to make sure you understand how your information will be used.

What is a cookie?
"Cookies" are small text files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, mobile or other PDA) when you visit a website or certain emails you open. You can turn cookies off but if you do this you may not be able to use all services on websites and you might see more alternative advertising, as we will not be able to limit what you see using cookies. There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. Brainbox Digital Limited does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. Cookies are passive and just used for transferring that anonymous information.
Why do we use cookies?
Cookies allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. Websites are able to read and write these files, allowing them to store things like personalisation details or user preferences. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide business and marketing information to the owners of the site. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. Cookies are also used for statistical purposes to track how many individual unique users we have and how often they visit our websites and to generate statistical cookies to track advertising impressions and conversions. There is further information if you click here:www.youronlinechoices.eu. We will use the data that we collect through our use of these cookies to ensure that you see relevant and useful adverts when you visit our Web site and/or use our services.
Our Cookies Policy
Here is a list of all the cookies that are set and how we use them:
Session Cookies are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser;
Persistent Cookies remain on your browser for a period of time, usually for several years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.
Anonymous analytics cookies : every time a user visits our website, web analytics software provided by a third party generates an anonymous analytics cookie. This cookie can tell us whether or not the site you are viewing has been visited before. It allows us to track such things as how many individual users we have and which browsers users are utilising.
Member area/Registration cookies : when you register with Brainbox Digital, we generate cookies that represent whether you are signed in or not. Our servers use these cookies to note which account you are signed in with, and where applicable if you are allowed access to a particular service.
Advertising cookies : sometimes we need to know whether or not you have seen an advert or a type of advert or how long since you saw the advert. In order to do this, we place a cookie on your machine when advertising is shown. We may use cookies to more accurately target advertising to you. These cookies are anonymous. We also set anonymous cookies to users on certain third party sites. If you receive one of those cookies, we may then use it to identify you as having visited that site if you later visit another site. Based on this information we may serve targeted advertising. Our cookies do not store sensitive information such as your name and address. If you would rather restrict, block or delete cookies, or any other website, you can use your browser to do this. Please see below for further details.
Here's a list of the main cookies we use, and what we use them for.
