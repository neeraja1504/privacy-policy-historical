5. WEBSITE ANALYTICS
( Google Analytics ) Our Product-Websites use the web analysis service Google Analytics by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. In order to deactivate Google Analytics Google provides a browser plug-in at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. Google Analytics uses cookies. Cookies are small text files which enable the storing of specific, user-related information on the user’s terminal. This enables analysis of the use of our website provision by Google. The information generated by the cookie about use of our Product-Websites (including your IP address) will usually be transmitted to and stored by Google on a server in the United States.
Please note that on our Product-Websites Google Analytics has been extended with the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” to guarantee the anonymised collection of IP addresses (IP masking). Where anonymisation is activated Google will shorten IP addresses within the member states of the European Union and other states participating in the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which makes any identification of individuals impossible. Only in exceptional cases will a full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and be shortened there.
Google uses the collected information to analyse use of our Product-Websites, compile reports for us in this regard and perform other related services for us. Find out more at:
http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
( piwik ) For the statistical analysis of user visits our Product-Websites use the open source software Piwik (www.piwik.org). Data collected via Piwik is used in anonymised format in order to analyse and improve use of our website. IP addresses are collected in Piwik, but only in anonymised format. Piwik is used without cookies being set.
You may prevent data collection by Piwik by activating the “Do not track” function in your browser. In most browsers, this function can be found in
“Settings -> Data protection”.
You will have full use of our websites even if the “Do not track” function is enabled. Piwik will in this case only be notified by your browser that the user does not wish to be tracked. Enabling the “Do not track” function may lead to restrictions in the use of other websites.
6. SOCIAL PLUGINS
Social plugins for various online social networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube and Pinterest) may be integrated into our Product-Websites. These allow you to place bookmarks on these sites and share them with other members of the online social networks. You can recognize social plugins by means of the logos that can be seen on the websites of the online social networks.
If You call up a Product-Website containing these social plugins, a direct connection is established with the servers of the online social network and from there the plugin image (which is now visible to You) and associated functions are communicated directly to your browser, which integrates them into the layout of our Product-Website. If You are logged into the online social network under your username and password at this point, the fact that You are visiting our Product-Website is communicated to said network and information to this effect can be assigned to your user account.
When You interact with the social plugins, for example if You share one of our Product-Websites or use the Facebook "Like" or "Share", the Pinterest "Pin It" or the Twitter "Tweet This" function, the content of our Product-Website will be linked with your profile within the online social network. If You are not a member of the online social network or have logged out from these providers before visiting our Product-Website, there is still a possibility that at least your IP address will be communicated and stored there. Further processing within the connected online social networks, storage time and intended use are defined exclusively by these providers.
The following links give You more detailed information on the social plugins used and the data protection notices of these providers.
