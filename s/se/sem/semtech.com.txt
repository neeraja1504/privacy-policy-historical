Website Privacy Policy
Your right to privacy is important to Semtech Corporation ("Semtech," "us" or "we"). This policy explains how we intend to handle any personal information we obtain from you through this or any other website we operate. Personal information is (1) information that enables us to identify you, including your name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers and email address, and (2) other information you provide such as your customer, subcontractor, project or program, design freeze date, or resume data.
Collection of Personal Information
When you visit our site and request information, sharing your personal information is strictly voluntary. However, in order to access certain features of our website, request information or complete transactions, you may be prompted for personal information. If you choose not to provide personal information when requested, you will not be able to obtain the particular services, information or benefits that require such disclosure.
When you visit our website, we may also collect certain electronic information that cannot be associated with you personally, such as the domains from which you came immediately prior to visiting our site, the number of visitors to our site, browsing patterns and areas of interest on our site. We may collect this data in order to help us improve our site, products and better serve our customers, job applicants, and others who visit the site. Because such information may not be used to identify you, it is not subject to the remaining provisions of this policy.
Semtech is the sole owner of all personal information provided to us, subject to the limitations set forth in this policy. In the event Semtech is acquired by, merged into or otherwise succeeded by another company, Semtech reserves the right to transfer its ownership of such personal information to such other company without notice to you. In the event of such a transfer, the privacy policy of the other company, to the extent it has one, shall supplant Semtech's policy.
Use of Personal Information
Providing us with your personal information makes it easier for us to make our website relevant to you, communicate with you, assist you in making a purchase of our products or in the job application process, comply with any requests for our information and materials, and allow you access to certain limited-entry areas of our site.
Under certain circumstances, we may provide your personal information to third parties for the purpose of delivering our goods or services to you and for other purposes related to your use of our products or your interest in securing employment with Semtech. For example, we may provide such information to our designated customer support providers, authorized sales representatives, authorized distributors, shipping companies, or recruiters. We will only provide those third parties the information they need to perform the contemplated service. Aside from the foregoing, we will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission, unless required by law or for the other legal purposes described below.
The personal information you provide us may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or any affiliates conduct operations. By submitting such information, you consent to the transfer of such information outside your home country.
We reserve the right to send you announcements relating to Semtech or our goods or services, which may contain important information about such goods or services. You will be unable to unsubscribe to such announcements that relate to technical service, security or similar issues associated with the goods or services you have purchased or requested.
Disclosures Required by Law and Investigations
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information in order to comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
We reserve the right to use and disclose your personal information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, infringement of the intellectual property of Semtech or a third party, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
