We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services necessary to our operations. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, process payment transactions, analyze customers' interaction with our site and process consumer surveys.

From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our members. In conjunction with these partners, we occasionally send promotional announcements to particular members. We do not automatically include our members in any particular marketing promotion; instead, we use a variety of factors, including member activity at the Seventymm™ site, to determine the appropriate members. We may use a vendor to carry out these mailings. However, the partner company does not have access to your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly. Seventymm™ also reserves the right to disclose information when required by law. We also provide analyses of our members in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that we, and our advertisers can understand you better, and so we can keep bringing you the best services.

Members should check back for updates to this policy.
