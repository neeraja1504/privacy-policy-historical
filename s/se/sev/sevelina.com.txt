In-Game Advertising : Our games may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered by our Advertising Network Providers ( AdProviders ), which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while you play. Logged data may include Internet Protocol Address or players’ user name, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. Your game may be assigned an ID number, which is stored on your device, and used by Ad Providers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic in-game advertising. The ID number is not associated with any personal data and for children-directed games is not used for behavioral advertising purposes. No logged information is used to personally identify you. The servers used by the Ad Providers may be located outside your country of residence.
