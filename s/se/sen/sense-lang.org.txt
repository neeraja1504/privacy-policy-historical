California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under 13.
What type of information is collected from the students?
1) First Name
2) Last Name

The student personal information is essential to support internal operations and account personalization solely for the use and benefit of the school, and for no other commercial purpose.

No. The students personal information is stored solely for the use and benefit of the school.
Does Sense-lang enable the school to review and delete the personal information collected from their students?
Yes. The teacher management tools allow the school to review, modify or delete the collected personal information.
What measures does Sense-lang take to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the collected personal information?
We follow accepted industry standards to protect any provided personal information. Each student (and teacher) account has personalized credentials (unique username and password chosen by the school or student). The teacher account holds the credentials of all students' accounts.
What are Sense-lang data retention and deletion policies for children’s personal information?
Student accounts can be removed only by the teacher. From time to time, Sense-lang reserves the right to remove teacher accounts (along with student accounts) with no activity for at least 6 months.
