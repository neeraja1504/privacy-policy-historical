Privacy Statement for Send2Press Newswire, a service of Neotrope
The following privacy statement applies to all Neotrope® online properties, and this site (www.Send2Press.com) you are now visiting and viewing. Send2Press® is a service and dba of Neotrope, and not an independent company. Neotrope is proud to be a U.S.-based company, established January of 1983, and located in Redondo Beach / Torrance, California (Los Angeles County), USA. All staff are based in the U.S., and our secure Web servers are based in Texas.
Neotrope® and Send2Press® (Send2Press.com) have created this privacy statement to explain our commitment to your privacy. We seek to protect your private information so that you have an enjoyable shopping and viewing experience on our Web site. We will not sell, rent, trade, or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. This policy is believed to meet all local, state and Federal privacy laws and guidelines of the U.S.A. currently in place as of its writing, and is believed to meet the minimum requirements for the European Union, and Canada, but may not meet the requirements for other countries.
You may wish to review this policy annually, as it may be updated each January, or as industry and/or legal standards require it. This page was last updated on: October 14, 2018.
Personally Identifiable Information
Definition of Personally Identifiable Information
“Personally identifiable information” is any information about you, which includes your name, company, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number(s) and credit card information.
Where We Collect Personally Identifiable Information
Neotrope collects personally identifiable information when you (1) register or make a purchase through our secure server located on Send2Press.com, (2) subscribe to our customer newsletter on Send2Press.com, (3) submit projects on our Project Form, (4) submit feedback, or other inquiries through this site either via an online form or by e-mail.
How We Use Personally Identifiable Information
Send2Press.com and Neotrope use your personally identifiable information to bill your credit card for purchases, to confirm your orders, to prevent fraud against you, and to contact you. For example, when you place an order on Send2Press.com, we need to know your name, company, e-mail address, address, and credit card information. This allows us to fulfill your order for our services and notify you of your order status, provide reporting and other feedback.
Neotrope and Send2Press also compile aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports about which pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns. Neotrope and Send2Press.com do not combine your personally identifiable information with information about pages visited, purchases made, or any other clickstream data.
Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To
Neotrope and Send2Press will not sell, rent, trade or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. Neotrope and Send2Press.com may disclose some personal information to outside companies who help Neotrope with the administration and delivery of purchases, newsletters, contests, alliances and partnerships (as applicable).
For example, to complete a purchase through our secure payment gateway (powered by Authorize.net, a VISA® company), or the optional PayPal® system, we must transmit secure data in order to verify and complete payment. We have made reasonable effort to ensure these partners safeguard and protect personal information at the highest possible levels of current technology, including the 2009 PCI DSS standards for credit card data. However, in the case of PayPal, you should review their privacy statement on the payment screen when transfered to their system, if applicable.
Aggregate statistical data gathered from customers, but NOT personally identifiable information, may be shared with our Affiliate Program members in order to calculate sales information.
Neotrope and Send2Press.com may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Neotrope/Send2Press or others.
Customers who violate our Terms of Service (TOS), fail to pay for services, and who are considered in breach of contract with Neotrope, have no right under this privacy policy whatsoever. Non-financial (ie., credit card or other data) personal information (such as name, company name, e-mail, phone) in these cases may be shared with other companies with whom we partner in order to advise them of legal matters such as a collection agency, law firm, financial agent; and/or in issues where financial matters may adversely impact a partner if the party in breach of contract with Neotrope may attempt direct and possibly fraudulent business dealings with our partner(s).
NOTICE: Regarding Abusive and Threatening E-mail, Phone Calls or Voicemail
As it clearly states on our contact page, and the press releases found in our client newsroom area, you must contact the company in question issuing a news release (the “news source”) regarding their practices, problems with a product or service you may have had, or other related queries. DO NOT contact us regarding such matters, as we are not a representative of a company for whom we have issued a press release (news announcement). Any threatening, libelous, or abusive e-mail sent to us regarding a client will be forwarded to the appropriate company and if you have made actionable and libelous statements in said message to us, your e-mail can be introduced as part of any legal action. Similarly, voicemail or phone recordings we make of all customer in-bound calls may be provided to our client in the same fashion.
Security
We use reasonable security practices to keep any personally identifiable information about you secure. We operate our own Linux-based Web servers and subscription data is stored outside of public server areas. Our secure server and checkout system can be verified as holding a valid SSL certificate, signed by GoDaddy. Our system is scanned periodically to ensure latest best practices are in place icluding retirement of SHA1, SSL 3, TLS 1.0/1.1, and other deprecated web technologies no longer considered secure in 2015.
No credit card data (card number, expiration, security code) provided during checkout is retained on our servers in either public or private areas, and our payment gateway provider (Authorize.net, a VISA® company) has been certified as Visa CISP compliant — and, our shopping cart has been confirmed by Authorize.net for compliance with their system security requirements. Optional PayPal payments are handled on PayPal's secure server and no PayPal account or payment data is transmitted via our system other than name, address and order information.
Our server and secure domain hosting our order system has been certified by a payment card industry recognized third-party as being PCI DSS compliant, as of Nov. 2008, and is re-tested and re-certified monthly to ensure our systems meet all current and updated security methods. This certification is provided to American Express, VISA and MasterCard, along with our merchant provider. As of May 2015, scanning is provided by TrustWave.

Cookies and Privacy
What A Cookie Is
A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies store information about your use of a particular Web site or service and are typically used to make services more convenient and personalized. Most cookies are “session cookies,” which are automatically deleted whenever you leave a Web site (and end the “session”). Some cookies remain on your computer until you remove them.
You are able to view and control all stored cookies by using tools built-in to modern Web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and MS Edge.
How We Use Cookies
We use cookies (1) manage log-in and shopping cart sessions for ordering our services, and 2) to help us determine which of our Affiliate Program affiliates and partners make customer referrals to our Web site.
Companies that have social bookmark tools on the Send2Press.com Web site (such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.) may also use their own cookies to help identify a user to facilitate easier “bookmarking” by remembering your account log-in with such online tools — these cookies are not set by us, but are set in relation to an account you may have with a site like Facebook or other social bookmarking site.
Your browser controls how cookies are used and can be set to not allow them and to send “do not track” requests. However, it is likely that our shopping cart system may not function properly for you if your browser refuses all cookies. Most Web browsers have sufficient security settings to allow a self-referential shopping cart session-based cookie to track cart contents, and which is deleted once the checkout process has been completed.
For some content on our site(s) we utilize the Neotrope® PRTrax™ system to track reader metrics for specific news stories across multiple sites to provide feedback to our clients on the popularity or response to specific news items over time. These tracking cookies expire at the end of a current “session” on any of our sites.
We expressly do not use any spyware, adware, or other stealth tracking mechanisms. If you come to our secure store from an affiliate partner, a tracking cookie is set to identify that our affiliate partner has “referred” you to us, so that they get credit on your purchase during checkout. The cookie then expires, or will expire in 14 days if no purchase is made after clicking an affiliate link.
Children and Privacy
Our Policy For Guests Under Age 18
Neotrope and Send2Press.com are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We encourage parents and guardians to explore the Web with their children or students. Visitors under age 18 may NOT submit any personally identifiable information to Neotrope or Send2Press.com, and our related sites.
Change Your Information and Preferences
Accessing, Updating, Correcting, Or Deleting Customer Information
All customers can log-in to their secure account to update personal data such as name, company, phone, and e-mail. This information is initially also used to send periodic infrequent customer-only newsletters.
Customer Newsletters
All customer newsletters have a one-click remove to permanently opt-out, or link to update desired e-mail account used for newsletters in the MailChimp system. Updating an e-mail account in the MailChimp system for newsletters will not change account information in the Neotrope/Send2Press secure order system (this allows you to have seperate e-mail account for promotions, but a main e-mail account for important order receipts, if desired).
Journalists On Our Media Lists
Journalists may specify that they do not wish to receive further communication from us (press releases) using the one-click permanent opt-out link found in each e-mail, powered by phpList on Send2Press.net. A link is also provided to change e-mail account to remain receiving news announcements, if applicable. If you have received a press release with our name on it, from another e-mail system, it did not originate from us!
RSS Feeds
If you have subscribed to one of our RSS (real simple syndication) news feeds, we have no control over how, where, or when you chose to self-subscribe yourself. You must change or remove any subscription in your appropriate news reader, ISP start page, branded home page, mobile app, offline browser, Web broswer, or similar application. Only you have control over how you receive RSS content.
Send2Press Daily E-mail Summary
If you have subscribed to our daily news summary by e-mail powered by Google's FeedBurner, you must un-subscribe from the one-click remove option at bottom of each summary e-mail. This is managed by Google and only you can remove your own subscription.
Google News Alerts
If you set-up a daily or as-it-happens Google News Alert for Send2Press content found in Google News, only you can change the receiving e-mail or remove yourself from the subscription you set-up via your own Google account.
Links To Other Websites
Many pages on our site contain links to other Web sites, including those of our clients. We have no control over whether a client has a valid and legally required privacy policy on any other site, and you assume all risk for following hyperlinks to any other site. It is advisable to check the posted privacy policy for any site on which you plan to enter any data, including name, e-mail, or more detailed personal data, to ensure you understand how that information may be used, protected, shared, and your rights under the laws of the U.S. and other countries.
Journalist Safe Harbor
Neotrope/Send2Press does not sell, rent, lend or provide the personal contact information for media contacts found in our databases.
