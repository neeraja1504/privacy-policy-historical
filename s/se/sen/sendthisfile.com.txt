By using the SendThisFile website, you consent to the data practices described in this Statement, as the same may be updated from time to time.
Scope
This Statement covers SendThisFile's treatment of personally identified information that we collect when you are on the SendThisFile website, and when you use our services. This Statement also covers our treatment of any personally identified information that our business partners share with us.
This Statement does not apply to the practices of companies that SendThisFile does not own or control, or to individuals that SendThisFile does not employ or manage, including operators of websites to which you may link from the SendThisFile website. This Statement also does not apply to any offline collection of personally identified information, or the treatment of the same when such information is collected outside of the SendThisFile website.
What information do we gather?
The only individually identified information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us during registration, when using our products and services, or when responding to offers from SendThisFile or from our business partners.
This information includes:
Email address : See "Email Communications" below
Billing information
First and last name: Used for credit card processing

We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, referring URLs, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, and are not associated with your personal information.
Why do we ask for personal information about you?
In order to use the SendThisFile service, users must set up individual accounts. This requires the completion of a registration form. This information is used to identify the specific individual utilizing the SendThisFile service. Users may provide optional identifying information, demographic information, and unique identifiers to enable us to provide a more personalized experience on the site.
We share aggregate information (information that is not specifically identified to you) with our partners and advertisers. We will not share your personally identified information with any third party, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect the information, you have consented by "opting in" to being contacted by SendThisFile, its third party partners or advertisers, or we have informed you of a change to our Statement so that you can then choose to opt out. We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by SendThisFile.
In short, the information you provide us can help us to understand how to make our website more convenient and useful to our audience.
We also collect information about aggregate website usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.
The information we gather is supplemented with information provided by third party sources, and may be used to derive additional data to enhance our databases. For example, zip code information you provide may be used to derive city and state information or may be used to add demographics data.
