Right to Access, Edit and Remove Your Information
You have the right to access personal information we hold on you. Whenever you use our Site or SEOmonitor Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after the information is deleted from the SEOmonitor Services, it may not be immediately deleted from SEOmonitor’s servers.
To request the removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us at privacy@seomonitor.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
