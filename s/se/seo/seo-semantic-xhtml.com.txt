Collection and Use of Information
seosemanticxhtml.com may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply either while on the seosemanticxhtml.com website or in responding, via email, to a feature provided on the seosemanticxhtml.com website.

Information Sharing with Third Parties
To make the site more valuable to our visitors, occasionally we may offer some additional features in conjunction with other third party service providers. Accordingly, we may make your information available to these third party service providers.
seosemanticxhtml.com will not disclose the information that it collects online from you to allow third parties to use such information to mail or email other promotional offers directly to you unless you have permitted seosemanticxhtml.com to disclose such information for the purposes of receiving promotional offers from such third parties.

In addition, the seosemanticxhtml.com website includes links to other sites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies are separate from this Privacy Policy. When you provide information in the course of obtaining third party products or services through seosemanticxhtml.com, the use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those third party products or services, even if it appears that you are on seoSemanticxhtml-branded pages throughout the transaction. The third party provider's privacy policy may differ from ours and you should contact the third party provider if you have any questions about its privacy practices. Please take special care at all times to be aware of which privacy policy governs your activity on the Internet.
Protection of Your Information
All information gathered on our site is stored within a seosemanticxhtml.com-controlled database accessible only to seosemanticxhtml.com.
