Your privacy is important to Serato. This Privacy Policy explains what information Serato Limited* and its related entities (collectively, “Serato”, “us”, “we” or “our”) collect from you, through our interactions with you and through our products and how we use, disclose and protect that information.
It also explains your options around our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
What does this privacy policy cover?
The Privacy Policy applies to your use of Serato’s websites, products and services (collectively, “Services”). Please also see the Serato Websites Terms of Sale and any End User Licence Agreements that apply to the Serato products you are using.
By using Serato’s Services, you are consenting to the use of your information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.
Updates to our Privacy Policy
Serato may update this Privacy Policy from time to time so you are encouraged to periodically revisit this page for the lastest Serato Privacy Policy. The current privacy policy replaces all previous versions and by your continued use of the Services you accept its terms.
What Information do we collect?
Serato collects information to operate effectively and provide you with the best experiences. Personal information is collected directly from you and other information is collected when you interact with our websites, products and services.
Personal Information
Personal information is any information about an identifiable individual and is collected directly from you. Personal information you provide us may include information such as your name, email address, billing address, telephone number, personal profile and payment details.
Serato may collect personal information directly from you when you:
create a Serato account
participate in forum discussions
purchase or subscribe to products
download our software or other content
activate a software licence
contact the Serato support team
visit our websites, and
submit web forms on our websites
communicate with us
You can always choose not to provide personal information to Serato, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or Service, or respond to any queries you may have.
Serato may combine personal information with other information that does not, on its own, directly identify you (“non-personal information"). For example non-personal information such as which parts of our websites you have visited may be associated with your Serato account. This allows Serato to provide you with a more personalised experience such as keeping you up to date with relevant product releases, content and sales via marketing communications (with your consent). If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
If you use the "Facebook Connect" feature with our websites, you give Serato permission to access personal details that you have provided to Facebook. This includes your name, country and email address. Serato complies with Facebook's Platform Policy in order to provide this feature to our customers.
Other information we collect
We also collect information when you interact with our products, websites and services. The following are some examples of information we may collect when you interact with particular Serato Services:

Error reports and performance information such as where the error happened in the software and system or software performance before and after the error occurred.

Information we collect about how you use our Products (including system information, certain product information and general usage information) can be used to provide you with a more personalised experience, provide feature usage data to the products team to help improve the product and to improve support. Serato Products may allow you to opt-out of sharing information about how you use the Product in the setup or settings panel of the relevant product.

Emails we send you may include a technology (called a web beacon) that tells Serato whether you have received or opened an email, or clicked a link in the email. Marketing emails we send you may be tailored based on your interactions with our websites and products. If you do not want us to collect information from Serato emails, or you don't want to receive Serato's marketing emails anymore, you can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link within each email or by changing your notifications settings when logged into your Serato account.

For any other purposes authorised by you.
Many of the purposes we use your information for are necessary to provide our Services, others are for our legitimate interests such as research, data analysis, improving our Services and developing new products. Where our basis for processing information is legitimate interests, the information will only be used in an anonymised and/or aggregated form so that it does not identify you. Where our basis for collecting and processing information is your consent, for example, sending you marketing communications and the placement of certain types of cookies and similar technologies, you can withdraw your consent at any time as set out in this privacy policy. We use technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymization and only working with trusted data processors, when we collect and process information to ensure your privacy is protected.
Sharing and disclosure of your information
When you use the Services, we may share your information only as described below:
Service providers and business partners
Serato works with service providers and business partners that support our Services. We may work with these companies to provide services including customer support, processing credit card payments, and sending marketing communications. These companies may have access to or process your information for the purpose of providing those services for us. They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes.
At times Serato may also make certain information available to its business partners that work with Serato to provide products, services or that help Serato market to customers.
A business that supports our Services may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your information is held and processed outside New Zealand.
Non-identifying or aggregated data
We may share aggregate or other non-personal information that does not directly identify you with third parties in order to improve our Services.
Links to third party sites
If you follow a link on Serato’s websites to another site, the owner of that site will have its own privacy policy relating to your personal information. We suggest you review that site’s privacy policy before you provide personal information.
Others
It may be necessary -  by law, legal process, litigation, and/or request from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence for Serato to disclose your personal information.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or exercise our legal rights or defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.
Additonally, in the event of a reorganisation, merger, acquisition or sale we may transfer or share any and all personal infromation we collect to the relevant third party.
Security
Serato is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We store the personal information you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. For example Serato websites are hosted with Amazon Web Services, which has data centers located throughout the world. This means your information may be transferred across national borders.
While no service is completely secure, Serato takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and alteration. For example, we ensure that our third-party data center vendors provide adequate security measures. In addition, your data is protected with encryption, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), during transition over the Internet.
Information retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out as above).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives). then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Transfer of information
We may transfer your personal information across national borders to other countries in compliance with applicable laws. If you are from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, you hereby consent to the transfer of your personal information to outside of the European Union (or from your country, as applicable), including to the United States. By providing your personal information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Your Rights
It is your responsibility to ensure that the personal information you provide to us is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may access, erase or correct personal information we hold about you by logging into your Serato account at any time or by making a request to us in writing. You also may object to the processing of your personal information (including for direct marketing) by making a request to us in writing.
We will process your request as soon as reasonably practicable, provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so on legal grounds. If we are unable to meet your request, we will let you know why. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
Where we have obtained your consent in relation to your personal information (such as your consent to receiving marketing communications or your consent to the placement of certain types of cookies and similar technologies), you can withdraw this consent at anytime in the notifications section of your account or by changing your cookie preference.
