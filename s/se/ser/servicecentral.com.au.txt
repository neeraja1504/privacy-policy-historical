Service Central shares non-personal aggregate, statistical information
Service Central may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information about our visitors with partners or other third parties, which is a customary practice on the Internet. For example, we might provide a count of our users from a particular area code.
Service Central uses market research to monitor traffic to and across its web site. This technology involves inserting special scripting in the code of each web page. This code is downloaded by you when you visit each page and then sends information about your use of the page, eg. the duration that the page was open. Information collected using this technology does not identify you personally in any way and is only used for compiling aggregate statistics of web site use for Service Central.
Service Central uses "cookies" to improve your experience
Service Central uses a standard Web browser feature called "cookies" to help us improve your experience. A cookie is a small text file that many web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so Service Central web site cannot "see where you've been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Netscape Navigator uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like.
On some areas of www.servicecentral.com.au cookies are used to distinguish you from other users. However, cookies merely provide us with a unique anonymous number that we can use in identifying -- and enhancing -- the use of sections of our site.
Cookies can also be used to store your user name and encrypted password, if you so choose. You may choose to disable cookies in your browser or use security software to prevent the storage of cookies. However if you disable cookies, we may not be able to fulfil your request or provide you with an appropriate level of service in some areas of the Service Central web site.
