Privacy Policy
Your Privacy is critically important to us. At SerpBuddy we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
Below is our Privacy Policy which incorporates these goals:
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, SerpBuddy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SerpBuddy’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SerpBuddy’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SerpBuddy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
SerpBuddy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments our website. SerpBuddy only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to SerpBuddy’s websites choose to interact with SerpBuddy in ways that require SerpBuddy to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SerpBuddy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
Our web site is primarily designed to help you share prediction with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the prediction you share and the metadata provided with predictions but also the people you favorite, the prediction you mark as favorites or interact and many other bits of information. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by SerpBuddy, not just your predictions.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
SerpBuddy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SerpBuddy behalf or to provide services available at SerpBuddy’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SerpBuddy’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SerpBuddy will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SerpBuddy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when SerpBuddy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SerpBuddy, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an SerpBuddy website and have supplied your email address, SerpBuddy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SerpBuddy and our products. We primarily use blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SerpBuddy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
