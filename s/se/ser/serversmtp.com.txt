Accountability
The Privacy Officer is responsible for turboSMTP's compliance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and other applicable privacy legislation.
Identifying Purposes
In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
If you choose to register to become a member of our Site, the Site's registration form requires you to provide personal information, such as your contact information (like name, email address, postal code) and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
If you choose to purchase services from us, we require financial information, such as: a billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. We use this financial information, to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. We will also use credit card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. We may contact you, as necessary, during the processing of your order for services offered from the Site. We may also use your contact information to contact you when necessary, for example, to respond to your comments or requests for information, to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems, as permitted by law.
If you choose to post messages in message areas or leave feedback for us, we will collect that information.
Consent
Your knowledge and consent are required for our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. When you visit the Site, we may ask you for personal information. It is your choice whether or not you submit personal information to us.  Generally, when you voluntarily provide us with your personal information, we will assume you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of that information for the purposes identified at the time of collection.
Sometimes we will seek your express consent. For example, to become a member of the Site, we may ask if you want to register for e-mail distribution or other services using an “opt-in” mechanism. You will not receive communications or services from us unless you click the box expressing your express consent.
Withdrawal of Consent
If, at any time, you decide you do not wish to receive communications from us or you no longer wish to receive our services, you can let us know by contacting us using the Contact Information below.
Cookies
"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a turboSMTP member if you return to the turboSMTP site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your turboSMTP account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to identify you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
We also use longer-lasting cookies to recognize you as our member or to process your account’s registration. If the account’s registration was not completed the cookies are stored for 30 days only. Otherwise, when the account registration was completed the cookies are stored to allow you to enter your email, password and some other options less frequently during a session. turb SMTP uses cookies to provide information that is targeted to your interests, offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.
You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
Limiting Collection, Use and Disclosure
Use
turboSMTP does not use or disclose your personal information for purposes other than those identified at the time of collection.  If we want to use your personal information for purposes not identified at that time, we will obtain your consent, unless use of your personal information for the new purpose is required by law.
Disclosure
turboSMTP will not disclose your personal information to third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express consent. These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is disclosed.
Agent and Contractors. We share information with companies that we hire to help us perform certain services, such as technical support and financial institutions processing any payments.
Permitted or Required by Law. Applicable privacy laws in US permit or require the disclosure of personal information without consent in limited circumstances. Where permitted or required by applicable laws, we may disclose your personal information. For example, we may disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant, or court order.
Breach of the User Agreement. We may also disclose personal information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.
Retention
We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill identified purposes, unless a longer retention is permitted or required by law.
Accuracy
Information that you provide to turboSMTP must be true, accurate and complete. We rely on you to inform us of any changes in your personal information (contact details, address, telephone number or email address) by updating them using the online Control Panel or by contacting us using the Contact Information below.
Safeguards
turboSMTP uses physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access and disclosure.  For example, we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as credit card payment information.
Your credit card information is stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes.
