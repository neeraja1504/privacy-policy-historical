Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13
ServerPress, LLC.believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the ServerPress, LLC. sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) on these sites without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If ServerPress, LLC. learns that you are under 13 years of age, ServerPress, LLC. will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the site without that verifiable consent. If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any ServerPress’s website activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service offering available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of any of the child’s personal information, please note the following:
(i) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the operator collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this website are as follows:
ServerPress, LLC.
931 n 33rd St.
Milwaukee, WI  53208
Telephone: (619) 800-8478
e-mail address: info@ServerPress.com
(ii) The types of personal information collected from children may include the name, email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity. This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a web server that automatically recognizes and stores information such as a visitor’s IP address/domain name combination).
(iii) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it publicly available through a chat room or by other means.
(iv) Unless specific consent is obtained from the child’s parent or guardian, the child’s personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the websites, other than as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will require, such contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.
(v) ServerPress, LLC. is prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity; and
(vi) A parent can review and have deleted the child’s personal information, can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information, and can revoke or limit consents previously given.
Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child’s personal information takes place at a website directed to children or where ServerPress, LLC. is knowingly collecting children’s personal information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address so that ServerPress, LLC. can contact the child’s parent or guardian. ServerPress, LLC. will then send an email (the “Initial Notification”) to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child’s information from ServerPress’s database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to ServerPress, LLC. to grant his/her consent or to deny consent in which case ServerPress, LLC. will delete the parent or guardian’s email address and any other personal information, if any, previously obtained for securing parental consent. Upon ServerPress’s receipt of the parent/guardian consent, ServerPress, LLC. will send a confirming email to the parent/guardian’s email address or take such other action as may be required to verify the consent.
If ServerPress, LLC. desires to use a child’s information for purposes other than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously given, ServerPress, LLC. will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian consent.
