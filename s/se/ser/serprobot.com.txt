What is SERP ranking and why should I care?
What is SERP ranking
SERP ranking or Search Engine Results Page ranking is basically the position a website appears in a search engines results page.
What types of SERP rankings are there?
There are many different types of SERPS but three main categories
Organic SERPS These are the natural results that the search engine has selected as being the most relevant to your search query and the most useful to the user
Paid SERPS These are paid for by site owners and provide an easy way to jump the natural selection process and become more prominent to the searcher. Usually there is a charge for each click that the advertiser receives and the site willing to pay the most per click will gain the highest position.
Contextual SERPS These are generated by the context that the search keywords provide and can come in many forms like maps, for a local search, hotel reviews for a booking related query, images for a visual related search or even business reviews for a specific service query.
Why is my ranking important?
If you are running a website then most of your potential visitors will be provided by search engines and the better your SERP ranking then the more visitors you will receive.
It has been shown in a great number of user tests that just the top 3 SERP positions get over 35% of the search traffic and 75% of users never click past the first page
Google Search User Heatmap
Some Search Statistics
93% of websites visits are referrals from a search engine.
70% of the links search users click on are organic.
70-80% of users completely ignore the paid ads, simply focusing on the organic results.
75% of users never view past the first page of search results.
Google has shown that 18% of clicks go to the first SERP position, 10% of clicks go to the second position, and 7% of organic clicks go to the third position.
Bing claims that 9.7% of organic clicks go to #1, 5.5% go to #2, and 2.7% #3.
There are more than 100 billion searches being conducted each month globally.
How are organic SERP rankings generated?
All the major search engines have vast amounts of data about the sites they index and for each search query they must rank these sites according to 100's of different criteria to provide what they see as the best and most useful results.
They deliberately don't disclose how their ranking methods work to prevent manipulation and are constantly changing or fine tuning the weight of criteria to produce more relevant results.
However over years of careful study, the online community has managed to narrow down the most important and influential factors:
Search keywords or terms related in the pages title, heading tags, image tags etc.
Relevant, original body content including search keywords or terms related.
Not over optimised with a high proportion of keywords within the overall site (somewhere between 2 to 5% is best).
Enough content to be valuable - over 200 words is mostly classed as acceptable.
The quantity and quality of incoming links using the search keywords as anchor text.
Rich media such as images or video to improve user experience.
News
SERPLAB rebranding to SERPROBOT 4 June, 2018
In December we were notified by a company that they had registered our name "SERPLAB" as a trademark in the UK and informed us that we needed to stop using it!
After getting legal advice we decided that rather than risk the service in a long legal dispute possibly costing 1000's of $ and countless hours of stress over just a name, it would make more sense to focus on important things (like finishing the final version) and agreed to rebrand.
As of the 7th of June we will be changing to the domain https://www.serprobot.com and our name will switch to SERPROBOT - Everything else will stay the same!
We will be redirecting anyone who visits www.serplab.co.uk so even if you forget you will still be able to find us :-)
All APIs will continue to work on the old domain (serplab.co.uk) and on the new one so your existing integrations won't break and will not need updating.
If you would like more information then just email us as usual on info@serplab.co.uk (soon to be info@serprobot.com)
How Can I Improve My SERP Ranking?
SEO or Search Engine Optimisation is a vast topic and there are many theories on how to achieve the coveted #1 search engine position, but basically it boils down to two distinct areas: on page optimisation and link building
On Page Optimisation
This is the process of creating a well designed, user friendly, relevant and useful site which is targeted towards a specific niche and targeting specific terms i.e. "SERP CHECKING".
There are specific best practices to be observed and basic guidelines to be followed which are beyond the scope of this but you can find more info and a good free site test at WooRank SEO checker - N.B these are just guidelines and provide basic a benchmark to ensure no grave mistakes have been made, a site can rank #1 with many items these testing sites flag as major problems.
Link Building
Search engines treat incoming links to your site as votes for how relevant it is. The text used for these links is the strongest signal all search engines use to rate your sites relevance to search queries.
Links are rated by the relevance and authority the linking site has and the more relevance the link will pass. So good high quality links are by far the best way to get a SERP ranking position.
