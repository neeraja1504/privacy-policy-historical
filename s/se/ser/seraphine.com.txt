All third parties are required by Seraphine to confirm that they apply appropriate data protection and security controls in compliance with EU General Data Protection Regulation. They agree to only use your Personal Data for the purposes Seraphine instructs and to take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful access to it. Our third party processors include IT, Payment Service Providers, Marketing Services and Logistics providers.
Should Seraphine sell or transfer any of its business assets, this may include a sale or transfer of such databases of information to third parties as part of a business sale.

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or business partners. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support and associated services. Our suppliers and business partners may also transfer, store, use and otherwise process your information outside the EEA for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations to you and to provide you with information, goods and services. By using our sites, stores, social media and submitting your information during the purchase of items or participation in competitions and other promotions, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing inside and outside the EEA as stated above. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.
