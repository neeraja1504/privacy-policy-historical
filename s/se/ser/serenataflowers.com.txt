SerenataFlowers.com Terms & Conditions
By placing an order on this website or when calling our customer services team, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:
You must be over 18 to place an order for alcoholic products on the Serenata Flowers website. By placing an order, you confirm that you or the recipient of an alcohol gift are over the age of 18.
Order Acceptance Policy
All orders received are subject to acceptance by Serenata Flowers Limited and we reserve the right to reject any order without giving reasons. In the event of rejection, we will refund or cancel any payments received via the payment method used to place the order.
All prices shown are inclusive of VAT at the prevailing rate (currently 20%).
Changes to your order
If you wish to change your order, please do so via the My Account area of the Serenata Flowers website. We'll always do our best to make last-minute changes for you, but we can only guarantee changes (including to the delivery address and card message) requested at least 24 hours before dispatch. Please note that once orders have been 'assigned to production', no changes can be accepted.
For peak season (Valentine's Day and Mother's Day), we are unable to guarantee to accept changes to orders within 96 hours of the intended delivery date.
Cancelling your order
Orders can normally be cancelled up to 48 hours before the intended delivery date. You can cancel your order via the My Account area of the Serenata Flowers website. Please note that once orders have been 'assigned to production', orders cannot be cancelled.
For peak season (Valentine's Day and Mother's Day), we are unable to guarantee to cancel orders within 96 hours of the intended delivery date.
Payment problems
Our website has a secure checkout (we use Thawte SSL Certificates and pass the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test), so we encourage you to place your orders online. On occasion, however, bank-related payment failures occur that prevent us from accepting your order immediately.
Occasionally, card details that are entered correctly and backed by sufficient funds are not validated because the card issuer is performing a random security check. In these cases, although we'll have received your order, we'll need to take payment over the phone. We'll email or call you as soon as possible in these circumstances. If you receive a message telling you that payment has not been validated, please contact our customer service team immediately to ensure your order is delivered on time.
Owing to time differences, payments made out of office hours, or problems getting hold of you via the contact details you've provided, we're sometimes unable to process a valid payment prior to the requested delivery date. Although this delay is regrettable, it is outside our control and we cannot offer any form of refund in these circumstances.
Timed deliveries
We offer a number of timed delivery options. However, please note that other than these standard delivery options, we are unfortunately unable to make deliveries within customer-specified time periods.
Adverse weather conditions
During adverse weather conditions (such as heavy snow, ice, flooding or high winds), our delivery teams may not be able to delivery orders on time. This is outside of our control and we cannot accept responsibility for the late delivery of the order, including if the delay is due to a backlog of weather affected deliveries with our carrier. Therefore, in the event of adverse weather conditions, we aren't able to refund or offer re-delivery of affected orders.
Delivery policies
For full information related to our delivery-related policies, please see our Delivery Information page.
Flower availability and substitution
All floral products are subject to availability. In the event of any supply difficulties or if the flowers we have received from our growers that are needed to make up your order do not meet our high quality standards, we reserve the right to substitute any product with an alternate product of a similar style and equivalent (or greater) value and quality. Where this is necessary, and the substitution is significant, we will try to contact you via email. If you wish to discuss the substitution we have made, please contact our customer services team. Please note that foliage and sundries (including vases) may be substituted without notice.
If we are unable to contact you via the contact methods provided prior to the time that we make up your order, we will assume that you accept the substitution.
Damaged flowers
Although we do our best to ensure that this does not happen, on very rare occasions, flowers arrive at their destination damaged. If the recipient receives damaged flowers, please contact us immediately so that we can arrange one of the following:
a re-send on the next available delivery date, or
a full or partial refund. The amount of partial refund will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the flowers.
If for any reason you are unhappy with your Serenata order you will need to contact us as soon as possible (and within 5 days of the delivery date) using the 'Contact Us' link on our website. Due to the perishable nature of our goods we are unable to deal with issues raised after 5 days. For quality issues we will require a photo clearly showing the problem which you can attach to the contact form.
Special offers
At our discretion, from time to time, we may offer products at discounted prices. These offers are valid from the time that we introduce them to the end date of the offer and they cannot be used for purchases before the offer introduction date or after the offer end date.
In the event that a customer has made a purchase and the price of the purchased product subsequently falls or is discounted owing to a special offer, the price of the product at the time of purchase shall 'prevail'. We are unable to offer special offer discounts for purchases that have already been made.
As our special offers are contingent on the availability of products, we may change the terms of special offers, or withdraw them altogether, at any time, and without prior notice.
We also reserve the right to offer different personalised special offers and promotions and it will therefore only be possible for the customer in receipt of the special offer to redeem the discount.
Vouchers
We only allow one voucher to be used per order. The voucher discount will be applied to the product cost and not the delivery.
VIP Membership
The discount cannot be combined with any other discount codes (flash sale and similar)
The discount is valid on already discounted products online
The discount is not applicable to any delivery charges that may be due, should you wish to upgrade our free standard delivery
Serenataflowers.com has the rights to cancel the VIP if it has been purchased for corporate use. No refund will be given.

__The SerenataFlowers.com Promise
(Because it's never a good idea to bottle up your gripes)
Flowers. We love them. And not only because they look good - because they smell good, too. So you can imagine exactly how sorry we are if any experience you have of us makes you wrinkle your brow like a wilted petal or leaves a bad smell in your nose. That's why we make it our priority to get things right the first time.
Every rose has its thorn, though, and we must confess that, on rare occasions, things do go wrong. It drives us nuts, but it's one of those little things we have to live with as humans. We don't have to live with the results of these mistakes, though - and you certainly don't, either.
So, if for any reason you're not absolutely 100% happy with your Serenata Flowers experience, put up your hand. We value your feedback.
Better yet, fill in a form - just let us know! We promise that if your unhappiness is any fault of ours, we'll always offer to put things right with a sympathetic ear that really, honestly and truly does care what you think.
Our guarantees and promises
Freshness
Because our flowers are sourced directly from growers and auctions, are flowers are normally sent out in bud form meaning they will last longer with the recipient. In the few cases where the flowers are not delivered fresh, please do let us know.
Damages
Our flowers are packed carefully to ensure they arrive as fresh and beautiful as when they left our flower emporium, but sometimes flowers do get damaged in transit. Should this occur, please contact us immediately. Please note that it may be necessary to return the original product, or in most cases sending us a photo of the damaged item should suffice.

Product-specific delivery information
Flowers
* Our next-day flowers and flowers by post are delivered in a sturdy box and wrapped with cellophane for protection in transit.
Hampers
* Hampers are normally dispatched to arrive on the selected delivery date or the day before.
* Depending on the size of hamper, delivery will be either via Royal Mail or via courier.
Other important delivery information
To enable us to contact you regarding a problem with your order, please make sure that you have provided a valid email address and/or contact telephone numbers.
Please ensure that someone is available at the delivery address to receive the delivery.
In the event of a delivery problem, if we are able to, we will try and contact the customer to try to resolve the issue.
In rare circumstances, our drivers are unable to deliver an order. This may be due to problem with the delivery vehicle. We ensure that these occurrences are minimised, but in the event that we are unable to deliver the order owing to circumstances that are within our control, we will contact you immediately via email or phone to arrange a redelivery and refund the original delivery charge. We reserve the right to provide additional compensation in the form of a discount off a future purchase from www.SerenataFlowers.com. No other form of compensation is accepted.
To ensure a successful delivery, please ensure that the delivery address is accurate and complete. If possible, please provide additional delivery instructions to help the delivery driver to find the recipient's address.
We cannot be held responsible for failed deliveries that result from a problem with the address and/or postcode you provide at the time of order placement, if the delivery was refused by the recipient or the fact that the recipient no longer lives at the address provided.
We are not responsible for any other costs incurred by the customer due to failed deliveries.
Deliveries to businesses, hospitals, universities
To ensure deliveries are successful, we recommend choosing a timed delivery option especially during peak periods (Christmas, Valentines Day and Mothers Day).
In some circumstances, for example, when delivering to some business addresses, hospitals or universities, we may not be able to deliver the flowers directly to the intended recipient. Please note that these circumstances are outside our control. In this case, we will deliver to the reception area or post room and (where possible) obtain a signature from the receptionist (or equivalent). This signature will be our record of delivery.
To ensure the highest likelihood of delivery success, please ensure that you provide as much information regarding the location of the recipient as possible within the delivery instructions, including department name, floor number, etc.
Hospital-specific delivery issues
Deliveries to hospitals are often problematic as patients move from ward to ward, or are discharged. In addition, many hospitals do not accept flower deliveries due to health & safety restrictions.
It is for this reason that we no longer recommend that flowers are delivered to a hospital. If an order is placed for delivery to a hospital and the delivery is not successful, we reserve the right to not refund or resend the order.
University-related delivery issues
Due to the size of university campuses, it can often be difficult to locate recipients at universities. We are therefore not able to deliver to recipients themselves and will always deliver to the university postroom or reception. Please ensure that you include enough information for the postroom/reception staff to be able to locate the intended recipient of the flowers. We are not liable for the non-delivery of flowers to recipients at universities as we have no control of the delivery once it reaches the postroom/reception.
Other business address delivery issues
If you wish to order flowers for delivery to a business address, we recommend that you use one of our timed delivery services (where available)to ensure delivery is made within office hours.
In the event that our standard delivery option is chosen for a business address and a delivery between 8.00 a.m and 6.30 p.m. fails owing to the recipient not being available, or the business being closed, we will not accept any liability for the non-delivery and reserve the right to charge an additional production and delivery charge for any subsequent redelivery. If you decide to cancel the order instead of arranging a redelivery, we reserve the right to deduct a cancellation fee from the refund value.
We value your privacy. We will never give, lease, sell or otherwise disclose your personal information. Period.
