information we collect
Personally Identifiable Information
Serta requests your personally identifiable information when you email us at one of the addresses on our "Contact Us" page or otherwise sign up to receive communications from Serta or register with the Website. We also collect your personally identifiable information if you place an order for products via this Website. You may also provide information to Serta and/or its licensees or dealers by filling out information forms at physical store locations. We may collect name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. If you place an order, we will also collect your shipping address and financial information for payment or financing. By choosing to provide us with your personally identifiable information you are consenting to the transfer and processing of such information in other countries.
Financial Information
For security purposes, we do not keep your credit card data in its entirety. We pass all credit card data through to our payment card processor, Authorize.net, and maintain only the last 4 digits in order to help track and confirm any order you place with us.
If you apply online for financing, Serta will also collect any personally identifiable information needed for the credit application, which includes your social security number. In addition to the sharing and disclosure of information set forth below, Serta will share the information submitted with your request for financing with the third party banking institution used by Serta to process such applications. Your information will be used to determine creditworthiness and to administer any approved financing. Serta will keep a copy of such data only until your credit application is approved or declined. This information is not maintained or stored on an on-going basis. In addition, once the financial institution receives your information, your information is subject to the bank's privacy policy and the bank may use your personal information to contact you to offer additional bank services, such as credit card services. If you wish to be removed from the bank's mailing list you must contact the bank directly.

Aggregated Information
In addition, we may take personally identifiable information you provide to us and aggregate it with information of other users and customers such that the data no longer identifies you. We may use and share aggregated information that does not uniquely identify you when it enables us to improve and enrich our services and Website content.
IP Addresses
Serta logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes and to track geographic analytics to help us determine where our Website users are located. IP addresses are not used to track a user’s session. This information only helps us determine how often different areas of our site are visited. We do not link IP address to any information that is personally identifiable.
For example, as part of the Website services, we can assist you in finding a dealer. We do so by collecting your IP address and/or your zip code to provide you with the information of the dealer nearest you.
Like most other Websites, Serta’s servers automatically track certain information about your activity on our Website. This information allows us to keep our Website running efficiently. This information includes: the browser you are using (such at Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.); your operating system (such as Macintosh, Windows XP, etc.); your IP address; and the referring URL and all Serta URLs you visit.
Other Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may also use web beacons and pixel tags. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or web bugs) are Internet tools, such as transparent images on the website or in e-mails that we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or an e-mail opened. For example, when you ask us to send you information, we may use web beacons to determine how many of the e-mails we sent were actually opened. A pixel tag is a type of web beacon embedded in an image on the website. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad, may contain a pixel tag.
Data Linking
If you register with this Website, nonpersonally identifiable information about your use and movement on the Website will be linked to your registration and may be stored and maintained in connection with your account.
Digital Fingerprinting
In the event you submit an application for financing, our service providers may use certain technological measures and third party databases and services to engage in digital fingerprinting. This technology passively collects information about your device to develop a digital identifier for your device, which is then stored on your device to identify the device in various online transactions. This information is combined with other information regarding your use of the Website and third party databases in order to identify fraud risks and reduce online fraud. The device data that is collected by our service providers may be maintained to create a history and reputation of a particular device to help reduce online fraud.
data use, sharing and your choices
We may use the personally identifiable information that you provide so that we may send you the information and materials you request or otherwise contact you as you request.
You may also opt-in to receiving additional marketing communications from Serta and its authorized licensees, dealers and distributors for marketing and other purposes communicated to you. If you choose to opt-in to such communications, we will use your personally identifiable information for the purpose indicated and we will share your information with one or more Serta authorized licensees, dealers or distributors. If you choose to opt-out of any such communications, you may do so at any time and without penalty by clicking on the link provided in the email to unsubscribe or by contacting us at the number provided. We will also use your information to process any order you may place or otherwise provide you about information regarding your product, such as any recall notices. You may not unsubscribe to communications regarding your order or product. Unsubscribing to marketing communications from Serta will remove you from our marketing database, but we will still need to communicate with you about your order or other request.
In addition to sharing your information with authorized dealers, we may share your information with our affiliates, licensees, vendors, service providers and agents who assist us in providing our products and services and processing your orders and payments, such as our call center and vendors that provide warehousing and delivery, marketing and advertising, data aggregation, hosting, data verification, statistical analysis and order processing. We require our vendors, service providers and agents to keep your information confidential and they are not permitted to use your information for any purpose other than providing services to Serta.
Finally, we will share your information if required by law to do so, when required to legally protect and defend the rights or property of Serta, when Serta believes it appropriate to protect its users, employees, or the public, and when required to enforce or defend the conditions of any agreement with Serta, including without limitation the Terms of Use or Terms & Conditions of Purchase.
In the event that Serta or its business assets (or those of any authorized dealer) are bought, sold, or otherwise transferred or reorganized, the transferred business assets will likely include the information that has been collected and will be transferred to the new owner, who will continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
finance offers
At certain points during your visit to our Website, we may check whether you are pre-qualified for available finance offers. We will use your name, address and other account information we have collected to check whether you might be pre-qualified for any available finance offers. We will provide an onscreen notice of our pre-qualification check. These checks do not impact your credit score and are only preliminary checks for available offers. Your request for any available offer may be declined if your full application shows you do not qualify for such offer.
If you choose to request any finance offers that may be available to you, we will then request additional information from you for your qualification application, which will be submitted to our finance partner as part of the review, processing, and either acceptance or rejection of your application.
