How We Collect Personal Data

Collection of Other Data
“Other Data” are data that generally do not reveal your specific identity or do not relate directly

we will treat Other Data as Personal Data. Other Data include:

How We Collect Other Data
We collect Other Data in a variety of ways:

through your device through third party services like Google Analytics. We use this data
to ensure that the Online Services function properly.
• Your use of the Apps. When you download and use an App, we collect certain data
such as App usage data, the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers
and what data and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device

3
your computer to assist your use of the Online Services. We also gather statistical data
about use of the Online Services to continually improve design and functionality,
understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions. We also use
cookies to track responses to online advertisements and marketing emails. (If you do not

high-quality service wherever you are in the world. As a result, we will, subject to law, transfer
Personal Data and Other Data collected in connection with the Services to entities in countries
where data protection standards may differ from those in the country where you reside. By using
our Services, you understand that we transfer your Personal Data globally.
