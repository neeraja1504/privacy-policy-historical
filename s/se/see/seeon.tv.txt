Advertisers
Seeon.tv may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the Seeon.tv site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Seeon.tv does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Seeon.tv to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.
Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Seeon.tv reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Seeon.tv may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Notice.
Our Commitment to Data Security
Seeon.tv uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Seeon.tv, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Seeon.tv makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If Seeon.tv learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Seeon.tv may post a notice on the Seeon.tv Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
