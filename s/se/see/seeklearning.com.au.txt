Privacy Statement - SEEK Learning
1. Introduction
SEEK Learning Pty Ltd (ACN 084 202 719) (" SEEK Learning Australia ") recognises the importance of your privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information we collect about you in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
Together with SEEK Business Pty Ltd (ACN 122 162 029) (" SEEK Business "), SEEK Learning Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of SEEK Limited (ACN 080 075 314) (" SEEK "). In this Statement, references to "SEEK Learning Australia", "we", "us", "our" include references to SEEK, SEEK Learning Australia and SEEK Business. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the word "you" includes website visitors and consumers of SEEK Learning Australia products and services.
The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about:
What personal information about you is collected by SEEK Learning Australia.
How the information is used.
With whom the information may be shared.
How you can access and change any personal information SEEK Learning Australia holds about you.
What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information by SEEK Learning Australia.

This Privacy Statement applies to any personal information you provide to us:

when using SEEK Learning Australia's online services
when entering into an agreement with SEEK Learning Australia and/or another third party via SEEK Learning Australia
when you correspond, or communicate with SEEK Learning Australia over the telephone or in any other manner including by letter, facsimile or email.
In addition to collecting personal information directly from you, we may also obtain personal information about you from third party sources such as our course providers and other third party service providers.
Where you utilise our services in order to enrol in a course and your enrolment in that course is facilitated via a contract between your employer, an insurance company, or other organisation that is funding the cost of your course (the " Course Funder "), and you have consented to the course provider disclosing details of your course progress, results and other information to us for the purpose of transmission to the Course Funder, then on receipt of such information from the course provider we will disclose that information to your Course Funder.
Failure by you to provide personal information when requested by SEEK Learning Australia may mean that we are unable to provide certain services and products to you.
2. What types of information do we collect?
SEEK Learning gathers two types of information about you, namely:
aggregated information generated by our systems (or third party systems) to track our website traffic that does not identify you personally (" non-personal information "); and
personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone and facsimile number, email address and in some cases, your billing details and general financial and credit information and such information as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the provision of, or notifying you about, our products and services (" personal information ").
The type of information that SEEK Learning Australia collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website and the products you are interested in purchasing through SEEK Learning Australia.
Generally, SEEK Learning Australia does not collect 'sensitive information' about you. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) information about your race or ethnic origin, your religion, your medical history and your sexual orientation. SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information about you in the event that it is necessary for the purpose of providing you with a product or service. In such circumstances, SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information with your consent or unless we are required by law to collect such information from you.
Collection of aggregate data
SEEK Learning Australia collects non-personal information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our website, the number of visits to specific areas of our website and the domain names of our website visitors' internet service providers.
We use this information, which remains in aggregate/ non-personalised form, to understand how our website visitors use our website so that we can constantly improve and enhance our services. We may also share this information with our course providers and other third party contractors for the purpose of providing you with optimal education and/or online career management services.
In order to better understand our users, SEEK Learning Australia utilises third party measurement companies to assess website and mobile traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the website:
The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK Learning Australia;
The number of unique visitors to SEEK Learning Australia;
How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK Learning Australia when they do visit; and
Common entry and exit points into SEEK Learning Australia.
This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK Learning Australia to assist in analysing the usage of the website. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
