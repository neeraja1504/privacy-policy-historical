Privacy Policy | Sephora
What Our Privacy Policy Covers
This privacy policy discusses the “personal information” that Sephora obtains from you on Sephora.com, in store, and in connection with the Beauty Insider Program (“BI Membership”). When we use the term “personal information” we are referring to information that is connected to your name. This may include things like your e-mail address, mailing address, birthday, telephone number, or beauty profile information you provide such as hair color and eye color, or information about the products you purchase, when those pieces of data are stored with your name.
This privacy policy does not cover information that you submit on other websites, even if we communicate with you on those sites. For example, if you post something on Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, that information is governed by the privacy policies on those websites, and is not governed by this policy. Information that Sephora obtains from you via the Sephora To Go application (“Sephora Mobile”), including when you apply for BI Membership or access your existing BI Membership, is governed by the Sephora To Go Privacy Policy, located
