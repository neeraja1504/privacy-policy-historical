We constantly seek to maintain the integrity of, and make improvements to, the Site. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyse certain information about how visitors use the Site. When you visit our Site, we may collect various types of technical data, which we maintain in both aggregate and personally identifiable forms. This data includes (but is not limited to) domain and/or Web browser information. We may track which Web site you visited before arriving at the Site and the Web site you link to when you leave the Site. We may also keep a record of which pages of the Site you visit, and how long you spend on each page.
What does Setanta Sports do with information collected on the Site?
We will use personally identifiable information provided by visitors to fulfil the purpose for which such information was provided, as described in this Policy, and as disclosed at the time the visitor information is requested. Order information will be used to fulfil customer orders. We may also use postal address information provided by visitors to send them, among other things, Setanta Sports offers. Additionally, we may use information about your activities on the Site, your purchases, and your computer equipment to improve the performance of our Site, and to customise the content and layout of our Site pages for you. We may supplement personally identifiable and aggregate information collected from the Site with similar information obtained from our affiliates, companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships, and other third party sources. We may offer visitors the opportunity to receive special promotions from us and other companies. If a visitor elects to receive such offers (or does not indicate a preference not to receive such information), we will use the information provided by that visitor to send those offers. We use aggregate information collected on the Site to evaluate how the Site is being used. This information does not contain any information that may be personally identified with a specific individual. For example, we may collect and analyse information about how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Site, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to and popular with visitors and enables us to provide visitors with a better and richer experience on the Site. We also use personally identifiable information and aggregate information for a variety of marketing and promotional purposes. For instance, we may use information gleaned from your use of the Site or the purchases you make to inform you of new areas of the Site and product specials. This information may also be used to assist companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships to display advertising or product placements of ours and of those companies that may be of interest to you.
Can I opt-out of receiving email promotions from Setanta Sports ?
Yes. You may choose not to receive promotional emails or newsletters from us by not checking permission boxes when completing any online forms or by sending us an email with “remove” in the subject line. We will respond to a request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to tell you important information about us or the Site.
Does Setanta Sports share visitor information with other companies?
We will not intentionally share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated entities (i) except as described in this Policy or as disclosed at the time your personally identifiable information is provided, or (ii) without your consent.

Certain activities and services available on the Site are provided by third parties. For example, if you choose to purchase a product from us, we may use an outside vendor to process and ship the order to you. In this instance, we would need to provide your shipping address to this entity. We may also utilise an outside email service provider to send our emails, in which case we would need to provide your email address to this vendor.
