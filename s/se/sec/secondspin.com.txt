SecondSpin - Privacy Policy
We at SecondSpin have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to individual privacy. The following discloses our information - gathering and dissemination practices for this site.
Personal Info & Its Use
SecondSpin uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their e-mail address), unique identifiers (like a password), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We do not market this information to any outside companies. In some instances, we may share some of this information with certain Marketing Partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor, when necessary.
Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt Out section below.
Financial information that is collected is used to check the SecondSpin Partners' qualifications for registration and to bill customers for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers or tax ID numbers) are collected to be used only in the reporting of income tax when the SecondSpin Partner may have received in excess of $600.00 during a fiscal year. (This amount is subject to change by the Federal Government of the United States.) This information may differ for residents of other nations. Demographic and profile data may also be collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in and displaying the content according to their preferences. This is designed to enhance the shopping experience.
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information (like their e-mail address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We may also collect demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).
At times, SecondSpin may conduct user surveys. When we do, we gather that information in order to help evolve our business model. At no time do we sell any personal information, but we may share that information with Business Partners.
We may, at times, use the demographic information we gathered as a marketing or promotional tool. When we do that, we will make sure it remains entirely anonymous.
From time-to-time, SecondSpin may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our SecondSpin and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. See the Opt Out section below.
SecondSpin also allows any customer to create an account with SecondSpin. This allows the user to simplify his or her purchase process at any SecondSpin site. All the information that a customer may supply when creating an account will be held in the strictest confidence. It will be used simply to manage the payment of orders and the shipping of same by us or by third party marketing partners with whom you have elected to do business. SecondSpin does not share any private financial information about its customers with any outside company or agency unless required by law. We may share other information with marketing partners.
Opt Out Our site provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. However, please understand that even if you have previously opted out, but later consent to sharing your information by accepting a third party's marketing offer, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party.
