Below is a list of all cookies and other web tracking tools on our Websites that are either provided by us or by third parties:
Our Own Cookies (so-called “ Our Cookies “)
We use these cookies to analyze web traffic, customize services and promote confidence in and security of the Websites. In addition, we use Our Cookies to distinguish one user from another and to determine the total number of visitors to the Websites in connection with the log files of our web server. The web usage data collected in this way helps us to receive the necessary feedback to constantly improve the Websites and to better serve users.
Cookies and plugins on our Websites that transfer data to third parties (so-called “ Third-Party Cookies “)
In addition to Our Cookies, we also use the following Third-Party Cookies and plugins provided to us by the following parties and for the following purposes:
Use of Google services on our Website :
The Websites use Google Analytics provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (“Google”). Google Analytics use cookies.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (identifier, browser Type/-version, operating system used, referral URL, shortened IP-Address, time of the server request) is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, within the member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, your IP address will first be shortened by Google on our Websites. For this purpose we have implemented the code “gat._anonymizeIp() ;” to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
Only in exceptional cases is the complete IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. If personal data is exceptionally transferred to the USA, a data protection level appropriate to the data protection level in the EU is ensured there by Google’s certification according to the so-called “Privacy Shield Agreement” between the EU and the USA (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
Google will use the information about your use of the Websites on our behalf within the framework of Google Analytics in order to evaluate your use of the Website, to compile reports on the Websites activities and to provide other services connected with the use of the websites and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
You can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie about your use of the Websites (including IP address) by Google and its processing by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
