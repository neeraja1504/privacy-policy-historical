Your identity cannot be reasonably ascertained from this information.
If you communicate directly with us via e-mail, complete one of our online forms, or use one of our other interactive tools, some of the information that you submit may be personal information (that is, information from which you can be identified, such as your full name, street address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).
If you choose to provide your personal information to us, it may be used in order to:
contact you in respect of a query you made;
provide the services that you require and ensure our site is relevant to your needs;
deliver services such as email bulletins (if you have requested them);
answer your requests and queries;
research and develop our products and services;
gain an understanding of your needs in order to provide a better service;
promote and market our services;
protect our intellectual property and ownership rights, or
fulfil any legal requirements.
We may disclose your personal information to other organisations (for example our service providers) to enable us to provide the services you have requested, or as otherwise permitted by law.
