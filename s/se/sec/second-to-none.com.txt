Your computer reaches us via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from, or what Internet service provider you are using.
Your browser offers "cookies" that, if you allow their use, store bits of data on your computer about your visit to our site. This data includes which features of our site you like best. When you revisit the Second To None web site, these cookies enable us to customize our web site content according to your preferences.

## How do we protect the personal information we collect?
Second To None uses encryption technology to keep your personal information safe and to protect it against unauthorized access.
