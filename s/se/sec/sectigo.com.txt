In most instances, you provide the information directly to Sectigo, such as when you create an Account, sign up for a newsletter, subscribe to Sec’s services, use a Sectigo website, download a Sectigo product, or request further information from Sectigo.
When You Purchase Services or Download a  Product
When you purchase Sectigo services or download a product, you will provide certain personal information. This information may include personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address; billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization; or other similar information that may be necessary for us to provide you with products and services.

If Sectigo would like to process that information for any other purposes, we will first provide you with sufficient information describing such additional use.
When You Order a Certificate
When you order a certificate, you will be required to provide certain information depending on the certificate type (e.g. DV, OV, EV, SMIME, etc.). The exact informational requirements are listed in the CPS for your review. Certain of the submitted details will be displayed within the certificate, and, as a result, will be publicly available.
You have choices about your information, but if you choose not to provide necessary information when purchasing a product or service, or ordering a certificate, (for example, information necessary to validate a certificate), then you may not be able to get that product, service, or certificate.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOUR  USE
To enable a better experience on our websites and provide you with better functionality and features in our products and services, we collect information about your interactions with Sectigo, like the products and services that you use and how you use them. We may use technologies like cookies, browser analysis tools, or server logs to receive error reports or usage data from software running on your device or our website and applications. We may also obtain data from third parties to enhance our files and better understand our customers.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data that websites send to your computer or other web-based devices to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your browser based on your use. Cookies allow us to identify you when you return to the Sectigo website, providing you with a streamlined and customized experience. Sectigo may employ the use of cookies to analyze trends, administer our websites, products or services, gather demographic information or to measure the success of advertising and affiliate network memberships. Sectigo’s resellers and webhosts may also use cookies; although Sectigo does not exercise any access or control of such partners’ cookies.
You can always control the use of cookies, but if you choose to disable all cookies, it may limit your use of certain functions or features on our websites, products or services.
For more information on cookies and how we use them, see our Cookies Policy.
Analytics  Tools
Sectigo's websites use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to evaluate your use of the Sectigo website. Google Analytics place a third-party cookie on your computer that is then used to compile reports of visitor traffic and internet usage. Google Analytics does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor and only collects aggregate data.
For information on how Google Analytics uses data please visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners sites or apps”, located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Log  Files
Sectigo uses log files comprising of non-personally identifiable information to analyze trends, administer the site, track movements throughout the site, calculate the number of document and file downloads, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
This information may include your IP address or other proxy servers you use to connect to the Internet, device and application identification numbers, your browser type, your Internet service provider (or mobile carrier), the pages and files you viewed, your operating system and system settings, and the location and time zone associated with your usage. Based on certain Internet standards, we may also collect information about the website you were visiting before and the website you visit after you leave the Sectigo website.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RECEIVE FROM THIRD  PARTIES
Information We Collect and Receive from Our Resellers and  Webhosts
Sectigo has hundreds of resellers and webhosts that offer you our products and services for purchase directly from them. Sectigo enters into agreements with its resellers and webhosts containing adequate privacy safeguards and protections. When you provide information directly to these resellers or webhosts, you are providing your information subject to the privacy policies and practices of those resellers. You should make sure to review and understand those policies and practices prior to sharing your information.
For Sectigo to provide you with products and services through a reseller or webhost, that specific reseller or webhost must share your information with us. When that information is shared with us, it will be collected and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
For more information on Sectigo’s resellers and webhosts, please contact privacy@sectigo.com.
Information We Collect and Receive from Third-Party  Sources
For Sectigo to properly validate some types of certificates (such as EV Certificates) in accordance with industry standards, it is necessary for Sectigo to supplement information that Sectigo receives from you or a reseller with information that it gathers from third-party sources.
As such, Sectigo may verify the information you provide us with information from independent third-party sources. The types of certificates, allowable third-party sources, and other relevant information are detailed with specificity in the CPS, the Baseline Requirements, the EV Guidelines, and the EV Code-Signing Guidelines. Information collected from these third-party sources will be used by Sectigo to validate the ordered Certificate. This is an integral aspect of the services provided by Sectigo and is required of Sectigo to validate a certificate.
Sectigo does not have any control over these third-party sources, but once Sectigo collects supplemental information from these sources, Sectigo will protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Sectigo also collects and receives certificate information from publicly available certificate transparency (CT) logs. Generally, certificates and CT logs do not contain personal information. CT logs were created in the public’s interest to support public oversight and scrutiny of the SSL certificate system. The purpose of the CT log is to provide an open auditing and monitoring system to protect users and to prevent mistaken or malicious issuance of certificates.
CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT STATEMENT
Sectigo websites, products and services are not directed to children under the age of 16 and Sectigo does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If Sectigo becomes aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal data, Comodo will take steps to delete such information from Sectigo’s files as soon as possible.

Request access to your information
Request corrections to your information
Request that your information be erased
Request that the processing of your information be restricted
Object to the processing of your information

YOUR CHOICES AND COMMUNICATION  PREFERENCES
You always have rights to the collection, use, or disclosure of your information. Remember, however, in certain cases, if you do restrict or object to the use of your information, then certain products or services that require that information may not be provided to you.
You can also limit the communications that we send to you. Customers may occasionally receive information on products, services, and special deals from Sectigo or may receive informational newsletters. Customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to receiving these promotional communications at the time their information is collected. You may “opt-out” of receiving these promotional communications using the opt-out link provided in each promotional email or by emailing optout@sectigo.com.
Even if you opt-out of promotional communications, we will still need to contact you with important administrative and transactional information about your Account and your use of the Sectigo products and services. For example, we may contact you about new release or feature updates or with important security information about the products or services.
PROCESSING AND CUSTOMER  CONSENT
Your information will be collected, used and processed for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. If we would like to collect, use, or process your information for any unrelated purposes that are not disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will first ask for your consent. You are free to withdraw this consent at any time by using the opt-out link or by emailing optout@sectigo.com.
CERTIFICATE REVOCATION & EXPIRY
Access to all issued certificates is provided through Sectigo’s public repository. Because of the nature of the services provided, there may be circumstances under which a certificate is revoked. Furthermore, certificates have a finite lifetime and will expire.
Despite the finite nature of certificates, Sectigo still provides public access to both revoked and expired certificates for network and informational security purposes, audit purposes, and fraud prevention purposes. Such certificates are flagged as revoked or expired within the repository.
AMENDMENTS TO THIS PRIVACY  POLICY
Sectigo reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, or materially change the way we use or disclose your previously collected information, we will notify you by sending you an email to the primary point of contact we have on file or by posting the changes to the Sectigo website for at least 30 days before the change takes effect.
