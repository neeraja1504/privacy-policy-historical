Its public website URL is www.secutix.com (hereafter the ‘website’) which gives information about the company and the range of products and services it offers. When you browse and interact with the website, the Company may collect and process some items of your personal data in its capacity as a data controller. As a Company, we respect an individual’s right to privacy and we attach great importance to the protection of personal data. These guidelines seek to explain in detail the website data processing procedures and methods employed by the Company itself or its intermediaries, in whole or in part.
** ** What is the objective of this policy?
The objective of this policy is to inform customers visiting the website (known hereafter as ‘online users’ or ‘you’) of the procedures for the collection, processing and use of their personal data as well as their prevailing rights under applicable legal provisions.
What circumstances might lead us to process your data?
Your personal data is usually collected or processed in whole or in part when you browse the website or when you volunteer information in data collection questionnaires that feature on the website. Collection usually occurs as a result of your relationship and subsequent interactions with the Company.
Generally speaking, your data is collected directly from you in the above-mentioned cases.
Apart from this information, we wish to inform you that we may add value to any personal data we collect and process, in particular for sales, prospecting, communication or marketing purposes by means of other information sources (social networks, so-called ‘public’ information sources, data rentals, etc.).
Moreover, for information processed in the context of our recruitment operations in particular, we use information you share with us (e.g., the specific form on the website) and include it in our candidate file (CVthèque). However, we may also have to approach third parties (for example a recruitment agency, previous employers, training supervisors or customers with whom you have worked on previous assignments) in order to gather information about you when considering your application or your profile. In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, we may collect information about you which is held by public authorities or organisations.
** ** What categories of data do we collect?
We may collect several categories of your personal data and in particular, the following:
Your ID: in practice, this means your title, first name and surname, email address, telephone number, postal address, date of birth etc.
Historical data relating to your visits, pages you have browsed, including information about actions carried out, interaction with the website as well as location data (the location of your IP address), data relating to your device or even data tracking responses to emails that we may send you (opens, click-throughs, etc.)
Data relating to tracking your relationship with the Company: requests for meetings, contact or information, correspondence and dealings, habits, interests, business opportunities, language and preferred method of contact, involvement in events organised by us, economic or financial information, etc.
Information and documentation about you (particularly your CV and cover letters) which you sent when applying for a new job or training course as well as any information we may collect within the context of recruitment (school and university career, training courses, diplomas, your work and professional career to date, general information about your professional life, economic and financial information and, if necessary, personal information about you, etc.).
Do I have to allow my data to be collected?
Whenever you enter personal data into a form on the website, you are informed that you must supply answers to certain questions and, more generally, that information is being collected, by the presence of an asterisk next to the field(s) concerned. Where there is no asterisk, you are not obliged to supply the information requested.
If you fail to supply information where it is mandatory, the request linked to this data collection (e.g., a request for contact, information or a meeting, submission of an ITT, or a job application, etc.) maybe rejected or delayed.
For what purpose is your personal data collected?
Depending on the case, the Company processes your data collected from the website in whole or in part for the following main purposes:
In general, management, processing and follow-up of your requests and dealings with the Company initiated from the website (e.g., a request for contact, information or a meeting, submission of an ITT, or a job application etc.)
Prospecting, lead generation and communication (emails, newsletters, and post, telemarketing, targeting, segmenting and personalising of exchanges, offers of employment or training courses)
Management and implementation of sales, communication and marketing activities by the Company as a whole
Keeping track of and processing job applications and performing all the tasks leading to the recruitment of a new employee, including selecting candidates and CVs, setting up a new candidate (or CVthèque) file; also, recruitment methods and techniques in order to help fill certain roles (offers matching the profile you have set up may also be sent to you for this purpose)

Depending on the objectives, the basis for processing any such personal data may vary. Generally speaking, this processing is necessary:
In order to manage, process and follow-up any requests directed at the Company (in particular answers to questions, requests for information, a meeting or contact, reviewing ITTs or analysing job applications etc.); in certain circumstances, these actions may be considered necessary in carrying out any pre-contractual tasks requested by you (for example, within the context of a job application or a training course);
In order to pursue the legitimate interests of the Company in managing and following up relationships, in particular those of a commercial nature with website users; and more generally, with its contacts and organising marketing, prospecting and general communications;

Furthermore, your data may be shared with any legally empowered authority, particularly when requisitioned by a member of the judiciary, police or administrative authorities.
Specifically, the recipients above are not necessarily entitled to receive all items of your data but rather only that data necessary to serve the purpose behind such a communication.

What measures are in place to ensure the security of your data?
In order to guarantee the security of your data, the Company takes all constructive and appropriate precautions and measures, whether physical, logical, technical, functional, administrative or organisational regarding the state-of-the-art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context and the purpose of processing as well as the risks for which the level of tolerability and severity varies, for the rights and freedoms of the individual, to maintain the security and confidentiality of data and to guarantee a level of security commensurate with the risks and in particular, to prevent them from becoming distorted, damaged or accessed by any unauthorised third party.
Moreover, the publisher of the website guarantees compliance with and certification under ISO/IEC 27001:2013
Because of the inherent difficulties in operating a web-based business, and as you are aware,  the risks resulting from the electronic transmission of data, the Company cannot be held to an obligation of result.
In the event of difficulties, the Company will make its best efforts to contain the risks and will take all appropriate measures, in accordance with its legal and regulatory obligations (corrective action, informing the national authority responsible for the protection of personal data and, where appropriate, the individuals concerned, etc.).
In the event that some or all of the processing of personal data is subcontracted, the Company will put in place a legally binding contract with the subcontractors guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of the personal data to which they have been granted access (all appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data).

Sometimes links on this website will point to other websites not subject to these provisions regarding the protection of privacy.
In this respect, your attention is drawn to the fact that the policies relating to the protection of personal data on these websites may be different from those of the Company.
We therefore recommend that you obtain information about the personal data protection policies for each of the websites involved.
In any event, the Company cannot be held responsible where the processing of data at one of these websites might contravene applicable legal and regulatory provisions.
How to keep up-to-date with these policies?
