Privacy Statement | Spanning Cloud Apps, LLC
Last updated: September 21, 2018
This Privacy Statement applies to our service platform owned and operated by Spanning Cloud Apps, LLC (“Spanning”, “We”, “Our”, “Us”).. Spanning has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Spanning, while primarily a data processor, is also considered a data controller in limited situations.  We are a business-to-business service provider and our primary role is a data processor for our corporate customers.  From time-to-time, we also receive personal information from individual corporate employees inquiring about our services on behalf of their employer.  In this last instance, we are the data controller for that limited group. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy statement or practices, please contact us at privacy@spanning.com.
Spanning complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Spanning has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms of this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list
We are responsible for the processing of personal data received directly from individuals and indirectly through our corporate customers under the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Spanning is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Spanning commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Spanning at:  privacy@spanning.com
Spanning has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration before a Privacy Shield Panel when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
