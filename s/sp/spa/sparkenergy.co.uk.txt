6. How will we comply with data protection laws?
Data protection laws require that we meet certain conditions before we’re allowed to use your personal information in the ways described in this privacy policy.  We take our responsibilities under data protection laws very seriously, including meeting these conditions.  To use your personal information, we’ll rely on the following conditions:
Performance of a contract: we use your data primarily in order to provide you with the products and services that you’ve requested, for example energy products.
Consent: we may provide you with marketing information about our services or products where you’ve provided your consent for us to do so.
Vital interests: in very limited circumstances we may use or share information about you to protect you.
Legitimate interests: to use your personal data for any other purpose described in this privacy policy, we’ll rely on a condition known as "legitimate interests".  It’s in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with the information that we need to provide our services to you more effectively. This means that we need to carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for example, in order to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you have under data protection laws (for example, to not have your data sold to third party marketing companies without your knowledge, or store your personal data in insecure or unstable countries or regions).  The outcome of this balancing test will determine whether we can use your personal data in the ways described in this privacy policy (except in relation to marketing, where we’ll always rely on your explicit consent).  We’ll always act reasonably and give full and proper consideration to your interests in carrying out this balancing test.
7. Special categories of personal data
Data Protection Laws define certain personal data as falling into ‘special categories of personal data’ such as personal data regarding your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purposes of uniquely identifying a person, data concerning your health (including mental and physical health), or data concerning your sex life or sexual orientation.  You may want to provide some information that falls into these special categories if you’d like to be included on our Priority Services Register.  If you provide this information, this will be an indication that you explicitly consent to us processing it.
**8. What automated decisions do we make about you?  **
If you’ve not paid for your energy 40 days after payment is due, details of your account will automatically be passed to our collections team and you’ll receive debt recovery communications from us .
9. How we may contact you
We may contact you by email, phone, text or multimedia message or other forms of electronic communication (including, where applicable, a message through your smart meter) or by visiting you (e.g. to take a meter reading).
10.  International transfers
** ** We, or our suppliers, may transfer personal information that we collect from you to third party data processors located, or have servers located, in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area, including the United States, in connection with the above purposes.  We’ll take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Our customer service team is supported by a chat team outside the EEA.  If you contact us by chat your customer account including your name, contact details, additional needs, payment history, and tariff choice may be viewed by an agent outside the EEA.  Where this is the case we ensure we have a contract in place using model data protection clauses approved by the European Commission.
11.  Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or when you open an email or SMS communication. They’re used to make websites and other forms of communication work more efficiently as well as to track certain actions. You can disable cookies.
When you use our website or communicate with us via email or SMS communication, we may place a cookie on your computer or mobile device. More information about the cookies that we use on our website and why we use them is set out in our Cookies policy, which can be found here.
12.  How long your data is kept by us
We will not keep personal information longer than is necessary for the purpose or purposes for which they were collected.
We’ll typically keep your personal data for one year from the closure of your account with us in order to enable us to deal with any issues or concerns you may have about how we handled your account, and also to allow us to bring or defend legal proceedings.  In some cases, where you’ve made a complaint or owe us money, we’ll need to keep your data for up to six years.
For marketing purposes, where you’ve opted in to hear from us after your contract with us ends, we’ll keep your data for two years after your contract end date or earlier if you, at any time, instruct us.
13. Third Party Websites
Our website(s) contain links to other websites operated by third parties. Please note, this privacy policy applies only to the personal information that we collect through our website(s) and we aren’t responsible for personal information that third parties may collect, store and use through their websites. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully.
14.  Security
We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures and have in place physical and electronic procedures necessary to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission to or from us by post, email, phone, SMS or over the Internet can ever be guaranteed as entirely secure. Communications over the web are not secure and as such, we cannot accept any liability or responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We’ll notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we’re legally required to do so.
Where we’ve given you (or where you’ve chosen) login details which enables you to access certain services of ours, you’re responsible for keeping these details confidential.  You agree that you won’t share your login details with anyone else.
