Advertising
Spare Backup advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not affiliated with Spare Backup. We contract with advertising service providers who serve advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or on an HTML email that tell our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Site.
Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing
We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on the Site. These advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how you navigate the site, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on Spare Backup websites. These advertising service providers do not have access to, or collect, personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account number or telephone number.
If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site, as described above.
Advertising on Other Websites
Spare Backup contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and Offerings on websites not affiliated with Spare Backup.

These ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements. These cookies do not identify you personally. Spare Backup's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo! or MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt out of targeted advertising based on the use of their cookies.
In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know which Spare Backup website pages you have viewed, visit the Network Advertising Initiative site: http://www.networkadvertising.org to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.

If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the Site from a different computer, log in under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
