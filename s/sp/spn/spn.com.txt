With whom the information may be shared
How you can correct inaccuracies in the information
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

2. If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction - such as your name address and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing.
You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.
How We Use the Information We Gather and Track
We use personally identifiable information in the following ways:

If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods described in this policy.
In addition, Symantec retains the services of outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to ship products, provide technical support, or handle order processing. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of Symantec.
Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Symantec to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations.
Choice/Opt-out
Symantec provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.
If you are on a Symantec web page that requires personal information but does not offer communication choices, or would like to change your preferences for information that you have previously provided, please complete the customer profile form at https://www-secure.symantec.com/custserv/cgi-bin/cs_privacy_dyn.cgi or use one of the other communication channels at the bottom of this statement.
If you are registering a version of a product that does not provide you the capability to indicate your communication preferences, please complete the customer profile form at https://www-secure.symantec.com/custserv/cs_register.html or use one of the other communication channels at the bottom of this statement.
If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.
Refer-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Symantec does not store your friend’s name and email address after sending the one-time email.
1.2 Security and Quality of Personal Information
We have taken security measures, consistent with international information practices, to protect your personal information. These measures include technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction. Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.
Since Symantec is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other Symantec offices around the world. For example, when European customers register Symantec products their personal information may be transferred to servers in the United States then transferred to servers in one or more of Symantec's European offices. Also, in certain countries our outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information.
We make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information. If you believe that Symantec does not have your current personal information, you can update it at www-secure.symantec.com/custserv/cgi-bin/cs_privacy_dyn.cgi, or use one of the other communication channels at the bottom of this statement.

1.4 Web Beacons
Symantec may use Web Beacons - also known as single pixel or clear GIFs - on our Web site to analyze traffic patterns such as the frequency of use of particular parts of the site. The data collected helps us learn what information is of most interest to our customers and what offers our customers would most like to see.
