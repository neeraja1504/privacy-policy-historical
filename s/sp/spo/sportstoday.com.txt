PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.
A. Information Collected
This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Site

collect information automatically from the devices that interact with
our Site, as explained below.
(1) Information You Actively Provide
We collect account details and personal information, such as your name,

Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
Internet; your login credentials; and computer and connection
information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting,
browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform. We
use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to measure and collect
session information, including page response times, and to measure and
understand visitor behaviors on the site. We may also collect technical
information to help us identify your device for reasons of security and
site integrity.
B. Use of Information Collected Via the Site
We use the information that you actively provide:
To deliver services, such as educational programs, information,
newsletters or software you request or purchase;
To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new
services from us, or other third parties, or to forward promotional
materials;

To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or the
Visitor Agreement, if necessary;
To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Site; and
To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or Order
Inquiry.
C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We may share or disclose the information you provide, including name
and contact details in the following instances:
(i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you email us a
question, we may use your email address to process your request and
respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or
contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order
to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share
the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We
also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.
(ii) To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers
or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services
that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your
personally identifiable information for research, administrative and/or
internal business purposes. These parties may use your personally
identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement
related to a product or service, or they may use such information for
their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not
want us to share your personally identifiable information in this
manner, please do not provide us with this information.
(iii) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or
independent contractors who help us maintain our Site and provide other
administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order
processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and
analyzing data, sending customer communications on our behalf, and
entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests,
sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these
unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable
information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative
services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated
third-party service providers that help us administer our Site will
have access to users’ personally identifiable information, if you do
not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have
access to your information, please do not register or submit any
personally identifiable information to us.
(iv) To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the
Site, we may collect from you your billing address and other
information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected
information in order to fulfill your purchase.
(v) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action
is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply
with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or
property or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
of our end users.
(vi) To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process
including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all
or substantially all of our assets.
(vii) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and
volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and
provide such information to third parties.
(viii) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third
parties the information collected from the Site. In the course of such
verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about
you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or
debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization
and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and
address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the
card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request
the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose
your name and contact or payment details to any third parties.
If you wish to access, move, or delete your data contact us at
myprivacy@musictoday.com and the team at Musictoday will assist you.
D. Online Tracking / Third Party Advertising
We use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies for
analytics and advertising purposes. Visit www.allaboutcookies.org for
more information about cookies and web beacons. When you interact with
our Site, interest-based advertisements may be displayed to you based
upon information such as purchasing or browsing behaviors on our Site.
These tracking technologies enable us to identify the ads you see,
whether you click on them, and other actions you take on our Site, so
that we can tailor advertising, including for example avoiding
repetition of ad content. We do not use personal information, such as
name or contact details, to tailor advertising.  For example,
if you visit this website, your visit may be recorded in a cookie which
may result in your seeing a targeted ad when you visit a different
website. For more information about interest based advertising and the
ability to opt-out from this practice across multiple companies, please
visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Some media buying platforms
such as Facebook enable us to use personal information such as email
addresses, and we take steps to honor the privacy restrictions imposed
by those platforms.
We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising
companies, to serve advertisements on the Site. Please be advised that
such advertising companies may gather information about your visit to
the Site or other sites (such as through cookies, web beacons and other
technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products
or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your
browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were
delivered. These advertisers may read and place cookies on our Site,
but they do not have access to personal information such as name or
contact details.
Our Site, whether accessed on a computer or a mobile device, is not at
this time configured to read or respond to ‘Do Not Track’ settings or
signals in your browser headings, which vary by browser provider. In
lieu of a browser-based opt-out solution, users can utilize the Digital
Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of
opt-out cookies. Our site and those of our third party advertisers or
other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies,
so long as they are present on your computer. Please note, if you
delete all cookies, you will need to reset your opt-out cookies.
Specific instructions on how to do so follow. However, please be aware
that we do not control these opt-out processes.
Cookie Policy
We use cookies when you visit our site. There are four main types of
cookies – here’s how and why we use them.
(1) Site functionality cookies – these cookies allow you to navigate
the site and use our features, such as “Add to Cart”.
(2) Site analytics cookies – these cookies allow us to measure and
analyse how our customers use the site, to improve both its
functionality and your shopping experience.
(3) Customer preference cookies – when you are browsing or shopping on
a Musictoday hosted store, these cookies will remember your preferences
(like your language or location), so we can make your shopping
experience as seamless as possible, and more personal to you.
(4) Targeting or advertising cookies – these cookies are used to
deliver ads relevant to you. They also limit the number of times that
you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing
campaigns.
By using our site, you agree to us placing these sorts of cookies on
your device and accessing them when you visit the site in the future.
If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer,
the “help” section in your browser should provide instructions on how

requiring personally identifiable information are not intended for

of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request
deletion of such child’s personally identifiable information as well as

F. International Transfer of Information
If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information,
we may transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or
to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or
jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If
you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please

States as indicated above.
G. Email Opt-Out
We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular
basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm
your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information
about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and
other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out
of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in
nature rather than promotional. However, we provide you the opportunity
to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types
of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding
new services and products offered on this Site or if you do not want us
to share your personally identifiable information with third parties.
The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the
appropriate box if such checkbox is available at the points where
personally identifiable information is collected or by contacting us.
We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be
aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages
until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may opt-out of receiving
such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link within the text of
the email.
H. Product Reviews, Forums, Chat Rooms, and Other Public
Posting Areas
Please note that any information you include in a message you post to
any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to
anyone with Internet access. If you don’t want people to know your
email address, for example, don’t include it in any message you post
publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION
IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time.
When we do, we will also revise the “last update” date of this privacy
policy. For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially less

implementing the change by sending a notice to the primary email
address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on
