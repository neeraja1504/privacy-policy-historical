SportsLocate.com allows facilities to create and promote offers for athletes using SportsLocate.com.  To use SportsLocate.com, facilities and athletes alike must create individual SportsLocate.com accounts.
We may allow you to create an account using your Facebook® or other third party service account (your Social Login).  We will not keep, share or use your Social Login except to provide our Services.
If you are a facility, we may require you to verify and/or provide personal and business information when you claim a SportsLocate.com facility profile or create your SportsLocate.com account.  This information may include your name, email address, business name and location.  Any personal information about you will be used by us only in connection with your facility profile and to provide our Services.
If you use SportsLocate.com to purchase services or membership offered by a facility, you may be prompted to enter an email address and/or other personal information.   We may provide all such information you enter in connection with redeeming an offer at SportsLocate.com to the facility that posted the offer.  We are not responsible for any subsequent use of such information by the facility or any third party.
