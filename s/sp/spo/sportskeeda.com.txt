A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the site), and allow us to track your usage of sportskeeda.com over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.

However, some features of sportskeeda.com may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Sportskeeda may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site’s service but are not necessary to its operation (an "Extended Service"). If Sportskeeda intends to use personally identifiable information for an Extended Service, the sportskeeda.com site will provide you with the ability and requisite instructions to decline this service. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from sportskeeda.com by following the instructions on the mail.
