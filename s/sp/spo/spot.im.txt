5. Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Advertising Uses
Our Services, our Partners and some of our Service Providers utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other tracking technologies which help us provide, secure and improve our Services, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns.
Our Services also utilize advertising for third party services and products. We and our advertising Partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying contextual, interest-based and other types of advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems.

If you reside in California and wish to opt-out of the “sale” of your personal information, as these are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), please follow the instructions in Section 8 below. While we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser and recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
Spot.IM supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive: If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by Spot.IM, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at www.youronlinechoices.eu.You may also use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.
Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Services or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see. These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads). Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.
Service Communications : We may contact you with important information regarding our Services. For example, we may notify you (through any of the means available to us, e.g. phone, mobile, web notifications or e-mail) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, service changes, password-retrieval notices, etc. Typically, you will not be able to opt-out of receiving such service communications while using our Services, as they are integral to such use.

Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “Data Controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “Data Processor”(or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
Spot.IM is typically the “Data Controller” of its Visitors, its Users and its Partners’ Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Under the CCPA, we be either the “business” with respect to Users’ Personal Data (if the User are directly engaged with us), or a “third party”” (if such Users are not directly engaged with us, whilst we process their personal information on our own behalf).
In the relationship between a publishing Partnerand Spot.IM, such Partner shall act as “Data Controller” (or “business” under the CCPA) with respect to its own end-users and Users of their Partner Site(s).In certain instances Spot.IM will only be deemed as the Data Processor (or service provider) regarding such end-users’ Personal Data, if we process such end-users’ data on behalf of our Partner and in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Use and other commercial agreements.
If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on our Partner’s behalf, please contact such Partner directly.  For example, if you are an end-user of our Partner who wishes to access, correct, or delete data processed by Spot.IM on behalf of such Partner, please direct your request to the relevant Partner.

The amended version will be effective as of the date it is so published. We will provide a 10-day prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via the Services. After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.
