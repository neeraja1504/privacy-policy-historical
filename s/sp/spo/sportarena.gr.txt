Does Sport Arena Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
Agents
We employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders,
delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Sport Arena, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Sport Arena and Others
We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sport Arena, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
