Privacy Policy - SpotX
The SpotX Privacy Page is designed to share information with you about how SpotX processes data on behalf of our clients. We believe it is important to be as transparent as possible to remain a trusted partner in the ad tech ecosystem.
You may ask yourself, “Why are there so many ads on the internet?” Well, although it feels like it sometimes, the internet isn’t expressly ‘free’ – much of it is ad-supported. There are two primary business models that fund the majority of content on the internet: a subscription model and an ad-supported model. In a subscription model, you pay for everything you watch (e.g. Netflix). This works well in some environments, but would add up very quickly if the entire internet was funded this way. Instead, a majority of internet users prefer an ad-supported model, where audience members are served ads, and revenues from those advertisers are used to support the content.
For an example, click here to expand
Publishers create content to attract readers/viewers and then sell advertising on the basis of that readership/viewership to make money. When you are browsing an outdoor website, you may be identified as being “outdoorsy”. Later, when you are watching a video on the best 14er hikes in Colorado, you may see an ad from a leading retail brand touting its latest rugged jeans. The publisher uses a chunk of this advertising money to make more great content for you to read and watch. If they didn’t have a way to monetize their content, it would not exist or you would be charged for it.
To create a positive user experience on ad-supported sites, online content, and apps that you use, publishers collect and SpotX processes some of your browser or device data.
Applicability
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to SpotX’s services and products. SpotX is the leading video ad serving platform providing media owners with monetization tools for desktop, mobile and connected devices. The platform features modern ad serving and programmatic infrastructure, and other monetization tools, like solutions for OTT and outstream video ad units. This policy explains what personal data we collect through our interactions, how we use the personal data, the reasons we share personal data and how you can access and control your personal data.
What’s in it for you, the user?
GDPR and other privacy regulations empower users like you to control your data. There are a number of user experience and advertising quality benefits that come from data processing in the ad tech supply chain that benefit you directly. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible about what data we use and why.
Get advertising that’s relevant to you
How many times have you gotten a diaper ad and thought “I don’t have kids! Stop trying to sell me this stuff!” – or an ad for steaks if you’re vegan, an ad for retirement living when you’re fresh out of college, or even an ad for a product that you already purchased? The list goes on, but everyone has a story of an ad that just felt irrelevant.
Accurate data allows ad tech companies and ultimately advertisers to provide relevant advertising to you at the time that you need it. Imagine you’re a new mom, with little time on your hands, and you get a coupon for diapers right when you need more. Awesome! Or you hear about a great new product that can help you make your life easier, more affordable, or more satisfying. Terrific!
In a 2015 Nielsen survey2 about new product discovery, 78% of respondents said they had discovered a new product from a TV or internet ad, compared to just 56% that found out from friends or family. On top of that, the number of people finding new products from news/lifestyle websites and social media increased by 15% between 2012 and 2015. Moreover, a recent study suggested 71% of consumers prefer ads tailored to their shopping habits3, so you’re not alone if you believe that advertising should be more relevant.
Don’t suffer through the same ad 50 times
Have you seen the same ad multiple times in a day or week? You often end up quoting the commercial and feel a negative association with the advertised product. These duplicated ads are annoying and ineffective. Some of the data we collect helps us reduce the likelihood of this happening.
Categories of information we collect about you
To accomplish the goals outlined above, SpotX needs to collect some information. However, rest assured that we will never know who you are. Rather, we collect information on the behavior that takes place on your device. There are different ways to capture user and device information, and they vary by device and environment. The information we collect or share also varies depending on the partner we are working with and why they might want to process the information. There are plenty of great resources available on the internet that describe these ID types, and we have outlined and defined a few below.
**Cookies 4 – Device: Desktop browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari, and mobile and tablet browsers to a lesser degree. **
You’ve probably heard the term cookie before in relation to internet browsing. Cookies are small pieces of information downloaded to your browser as you browse the internet. They act as a unique identifier for that browser (you will have a different cookie if you use Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox for example) and allow for many different types of activities. Because they are unique to the browser instance, if you change computers, clear your cookies5, or change browsers, the cookie will be different. This is in contrast to the device identifiers we outline later which are unique to each device, not each browser.
Cookies can help the browser or site owner:
Remember your site preferences such as your preferred language, currency, or content category
Maintain your shopping cart, and report activities within it (such as buying or abandonment)
Remember your password
Understand how you use the site (so that they can improve it)
For advertising, cookies help ad tech companies:
Know if you’ve watched or interacted with an ad
Understand your behavior as you move from site to site to help show you more relevant ads or to attribute a purchase to an ad that you saw
Sync audience data between buyers and sellers. In an ideal scenario, both buyers and sellers know that they’ve seen your device before and are able to apply the data they know about that ID to the ad opportunity. For example, a beverage company builds a profile based on your device’s behavior and believes that you are a “beverage intender”. As the Ad Server, SpotX needs to surface the information (such as the cookie) to the buyer to say “This ID is browsing on X site and is available to see an ad.” This enables the buyer to know that it is an opportunity they want to purchase and to do so. This process is called syncing. Cookies help facilitate this throughout the ad ecosystem. Syncing also helps achieve the benefits outlined in “What’s in it for you, the user”.
Identify for Advertisers (IDFA) – Device: all iOS Devices
IDFA is Apple iOS’s specific device ID for advertising. The IDFA is a random identifier assigned to an individual device, and is used to deliver customized ads. This ID is generated for mobile apps, whereas if you are browsing on a web browser via mobile device, a browser cookie will be used (see “Cookies”). The IDFA can be viewed or reset by the user.
Google Play ID/GAID/AAID – Device: All Android Devices
The AAID is Android’s version of the unique advertiser identifier with similar functionality and capabilities.
SpotX Audience ID – Device: All connected devices
The SpotX Audience ID is a unique ID that enables us to track audiences internally—it is derived from each ad call source, such as a cookie or IDFA. This ID is especially important for Do Not Track6 and Limit Ad Tracking7 requests. We use this ID to ensure we do not serve any targeted ads to you. It also can be used to help us limit the number of repetitive ads you might see.
Publisher Provided ID (PPID) – Device: Depends, most connected devices
A unique ID provided by the publisher / media owner to help track usage on their properties, usually through a login. Similar to the SpotX Audience ID, this ID enables the publishers to get a better picture of what types of users are visiting their sites and mobile or CTV apps. For example, a sports news site may create an PPID to help track interests, and activities across its properties to help create a better user experience and to help deliver more relevant advertising.
IP Address – Device: All internet connected devices
IP Addresses are a unique set of numbers such as 191.122.50.155 that identify the location of a device on a network. Similar to how a home address is used to send you mail, the IP address is a specific location that allows data to pass through the internet to another specific location. It is the basis by which a web page loads on your machine and not on someone else’s, for example. There are many different types of IP addresses that have varied uses in the modern web, though SpotX primarily uses IP address to identify general location (such as postal code, for localized advertising) and for cookieless environments (such as connected televisions). In many cases, we hash or obfuscate the IP address so that the usable information like general location is still passed but the exact IP is not.
How we collate it together
After collecting some of the aforementioned data points, we collate the anonymous or pseudonymous information and pass it along to our partners. While you may view your experience online as a single, unified experience, the reality is that there are many companies doing work behind the scenes to create that experience for you. There is a whole ecosystem of publishers, advertisers, and tech companies, like SpotX, which help connect publishers with advertisers to create the free, ad-supported internet. By passing data between partners, we can help create a more unified experience online.
Cross-Device advertising
Cross-Device advertising is a method in which a company attempts to group or map the devices that are owned by an individual or household. Cross-device advertising provides similar benefits as data collection (including relevant ads and frequency capping), but across your various devices. While SpotX can advertise to any IP connected device, we do not coordinate cross-device advertising.
For an example, click here to expand
You probably have a desktop, a mobile phone, a tablet, and maybe even a connected TV.  Cross-device techniques enable advertisers to deliver an ad campaign that is coordinated and designed for those specific devices.  For example, you might see an ad on a connected TV for diapers at night to generate brand awareness (when you are unlikely to go to a retail store and buy them).  You may then see a follow up ad for diapers on your phone when you are out and about during the day, this time with a discount attached. This technique enables an advertiser to tell a more complete and engaging story to the consumer in a way appropriate for the device, without being overwhelming or repetitive.  It also enables brands to understand the customer journey in a deeper way, which will help them generate a better customer experience for you.
What we don’t know about you
Ok, so we’ve gone into a lot of detail about what types of information we collect and why. Here are some of the key data points that we don’t collect, but that you may be concerned about. Keep in mind that this is far from an exhaustive list. We make a conscious effort to never collect this information except from our own customers because, frankly, we don’t need it and we don’t want it.
Name
Phone
Address
E-mail address
Exact location
Friends and family
Our philosophy on data protection and what differentiates us
SpotX is run by people just like you. We browse the internet too, and want to be a part of a system that we all can trust. We read the same news articles, e.g. Facebook/Cambridge Analytica8, Equifax, Dun & Bradstreet, America’s JobLink9, and are genuinely concerned with some of the safety and transparency practices employed by other companies. This is why we believe in user privacy and rigorous data protection. One of the reasons we are so sensitive to this topic is because we have grown up in the ad tech industry and have seen the evolution of industry practices. This perspective allows us to be thoughtful in what we do; we believe we need to lead from the front and help push the industry toward better practices. As a leader in Brand Safety and with features like Audience Lock, we strive to remove bad actors from the system and to protect data from getting into the wrong hands.
From a technical perspective, we take precautions to minimize the risk of valuable personal data through techniques such as encryption, hashing, obfuscation, pseudonymization, and minimizing the duration that we hold onto data. We have also incorporated Privacy by Design and Default into our product development process so that privacy is considered from the very beginning of a new product idea.
Our data philosophy aligns well with the GDPR. We’ve written a series of blog posts on the topic and are looking forward to the positive changes it brings to the industry.
CUSTOMER-PROVIDED INFORMATION
This section describes SpotX’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you or your representative use our Services. By visiting the SpotX website, located at http://www.SpotX.tv (the “Website”), and/or using our service (the Website and services we offer are collectively referred to as the “Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This privacy policy contains all the information you need to exercise your rights under CCPA including the Right to know data collected about you and the Right to say no to the sale of personal information.
SpotX Sale of Data under CCPA
SpotX’s use of the personal information specified in the Categories of Personal Information, Data Retention, and General Workflow sections of this privacy policy may qualify as a “Sale” under CCPA, since the data we provide to partners helps us generate valuable consideration. It is likely that each of these categories was “sold” in the past twelve months.
General Workflow – Sources of Personal Information
The following describes the general workflow of data in our systems.
The key workflow is triggered by a user (Data Subject), who is visiting the publisher’s (Controller’s/Business’s) Website and/or Application by requesting the website URL through the browser or by opening the Application on the applicable device.
Within the Website and/or Application an ad tag is integrated, which triggers a request to the SpotX ad serving Platform, requesting an advertisement.
In the event that the publisher has a 1st party data connection through the SpotX platform, SpotX will cross reference the request with the Data Management Platform (Sub-processor/Service Provider) used by the Publisher.
SpotX cooperates with different 3rd Parties (Sub-processors/Service Provider), including but not limited to DSP’s – to enable and allow monetization of the publisher’s Website and/or Application.
With every creative delivered by SpotX, it will trigger requests to 3rd party brand safety measurement vendors (Sub-processors/Service Provider), which are measuring the compliance of the website and the creative displayed with the expectations of the advertisers.
Furthermore, SpotX synchronizes user ID’s with the 3rd Party Data Management platforms and DSP’s for the purpose laid out in Data Retention Policies
After the ad delivery process, SpotX aggregates the number of delivered creatives and standard KPIs including but not limited to: Clicks and Completed views. This information is used to invoice the 3rd Parties used for monetization, be it by the publisher or SpotX. Additionally this information is used to execute the business agreement between the publisher and SpotX.
Technical and operational measures
The following describes the technical and operational measures that SpotX uses to ensure we follow applicable Data Protection Laws.
Physical Access Control
The aim of physical access control is to prevent access by unauthorized persons to data processing facilities which are used for the processing or use of personal data.
SpotX maintains its own cages within data centers, which are located in Virginia, Denver, Amsterdam and Singapore. All entrants to the data center are required to to identify themselves, typically biometrically, as well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorized employees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centers. Visitors must register in advance to visit the data center, and must specify the areas they wish to visit within. When visitors arrive, their identity and approval to visit the site is verified by on-site operations. Specific cages are secured by badge and key access and have 24/7 CCTV monitoring. Access to the SpotX cage can only be given by employees and maintenance, when the visit has been requested and authorized by data center and SpotX systems management.
System Access Control
The objective of system access control is to prevent unauthorized persons from using data processing facilities used for the processing or use of personal data.
SpotX has multiple measures in place to ensure no unauthorized individuals can access the SpotX systems. These measures include but are not limited to:
SpotX offices have secured entry using badges and keys
Access to systems is provided based on a personal log in that has to meet strict requirements and is exposed to either 2-step verification and/or placed behind a secured VPN.
Every employee is assigned a role which places the employee in particular user groups, these groups determine to which systems and to which level the employee has access with a personal log in.
Provided workstations and mobile computers are equipped with software that allows instant close off and wiping of the the device in question should such equipment be compromised.
Data Access Control
The following measures are used to ensure that those authorized to use a data processing system can only access data in accordance with their access permission, and that personal data cannot be read, copied, changed or deleted during processing and use and after storage without authorization:
As stated in the systems control section of this appendix, access levels are assigned to groups of employees, or individuals, at SpotX based on role and responsibility.
Only authorized system operators have access to production data.
SpotX has a strict policy in place to make sure all access is revoked upon termination of employment.
Data made available outside the authorized system operator’s access level is hashed and salted.
Separation Control
The goal of separation control is to ensure that data collected for different purposes is processed separately.
Within SpotX all the personal data that is being processed is kept in a separate database cluster. Only authorized system operators have the ability to access the production data, all developers only have the ability to develop on staging data.
Every developer has personalized and logged access to the code repositories. All development goes through extensive code review. After review it is tested in our test environment.
Deployments to production are strictly managed by our Project Management team and can only be made by authorized system operators that are organizationally separate from the development team. Every deployment on production must be approved and documented via a central ticketing system with role separation.
Transfer Control
The aim of transfer control is to ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed by unauthorized parties during the electronic transmission of these data or during their transport or storage on a data carrier. It must be possible to verify and identify where a transmission of personal data by entities for data transmission purposes takes place.
In the process of transferring information – SpotX only stores Personal Data of EU citizens in its Amsterdam data center. All Personal Data that gets transferred from our Amsterdam data center to our data centers located in the United States is hashed and salted before transfer. Transfer takes place on an isolated connection specific to SpotX. For these transfers our required model clauses are in place.
SpotX logs all received and transferred bodies for both internal and external transport of data. SpotX aims to have the transport take place on secured endpoints.
Input Control
By using the following measures, SpotX ensures the exact circumstances for data input, which can be checked and identified afterwards:
The SpotX platform historicizes any changes to the system settings made on an individual user basis.
Input processes are exposed to a strict integration and input process.
All input is logged and can be traced.
Availability Control
SpotX has multiple measures in place to ensure availability and resilience of data.
All data centers containing SpotX’s data cages are equipped with alarms on server rooms, temperature and humidity monitors, are connected to emergency generators, are connected to overvoltage protection devices and smoke and fire alarms.
SpotX has 24/7 monitoring in place that checks the operational parameters of the hardware and is connected to a pager system that warns our dedicated system engineers in case of alarms.
Additionally, all SpotX data is part of a clear stated backup plan and part of a disaster recovery plan.
Job Control
All third parties that process Personal Data are subject to a Data Processing Agreement. Every new partner relationship that is established will be part of a diligence process and will be subject to the Data Processing Agreement. SpotX has safeguards in place that will prevent EU traffic from being processed by any party without a Data Processing Agreement in place.
All Data Processing Agreements have language ensuring alignment with the requirements set by GDPR including but not limited to rights of audit, destruction of data upon termination of contract and documentation of security measures in place set by the 3rd Party.

Notice about controllers under GDPR
To become GDPR compliant, SpotX signed a data processing agreement (DPA) with our Publishers to define our rights and responsibilities regarding Personal Data protection in the EU. This agreement listed a number of Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) as sub-processors of SpotX. In our discussions to secure DPAs between SpotX and the DSPs, some DSPs indicated that due to the nature of their processing activities, they consider themselves as data Controllers. As a result, we’ve agreed to implement data transfer agreements with these particular DSPs to properly protect and process the Data in a manner that meets the requirements of applicable Data Protection Laws. Please note that many of these DSPs have committed to adopt the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. With this market-wide standard, there will be a common code of conduct throughout the industry with regards to data transfer and protection.
As independent Controllers, these DSPs will not be bound by processing instructions from other parties. If you do not wish for us to share Personal Data with these DSPs on your behalf, including Data to enable monetization and audience syncing, please contact your account team and they can help you block the DSP globally or regionally.
Below you will find a list of all parties previously referenced as sub-Processors under our DPA. These DSPs have now defined themselves as Controllers. For more information on their data practices, please refer to their privacy policies. This list will be kept up to date here:
