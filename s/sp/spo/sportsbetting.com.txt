A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, you may not be able to participate in our sweepstakes or contests. Cookies also enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example certain contest promoters). However, we do not have access to nor do we control these cookies.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We use an outside shipping company to ship our CD ROM's, an outside hosting company to host our mailing lists and a third party financial processing company to process deposits and withdrawals into and out of your account. These companies do not use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
We may, from time to time, partner with another party to provide specific services. If you sign up for these services, we may share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services to you.
These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Refer a Friend
If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site, we ask for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit this site. We do not store this information permanently.
Security
This website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via this website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration and financial processing forms ask you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or birth date), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 128 bit SSL. While on a secure page such as our credit card form, the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.ssl.com.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line. Your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
Site and Service Updates
We also may send you site and service announcement updates. You are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We may communicate with you via e-mail or phone to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If your personally identifiable information (such as your e-mail address) changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by contacting our customer service department via Live Chat. Changes to your e-mail address and physical address should also be sent to us using this form, if you wish to continue to receive our newsletter and our free CD ROM software.
Not Accessible by Minors
We provide services to adults only. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use our services.
Choice/Opt-out
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes such as newsletters and special offers by following the simple instructions at the bottom of any one of these documents that are sent to you.
We will strive to inform you when your information is being collected by outside parties. We do this so you can make an informed decision as to whether you should proceed with services that we offer through an outside party.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on our site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated in this statement, we will notify you by way of an e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your information in this different manner.
