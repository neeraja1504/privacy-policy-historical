Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to the Action Network, Inc. and its affiliates (the “Action Network Group,” “we,” “us,” and “our”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information, data collection, and other privacy practices for the sites owned or operated by us, including, but not limited to, the Action Network, Inc. website currently located at www.actionnetwork.com, the Fantasy Labs, Inc. website currently located at www.fantasylabs.com, the SportsAction, Inc. website currently located at sportsaction.io, and the Sports Insights, Inc. website currently located at www.sportsinsights.com (collectively, the “Site”), including, without limitation, what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. As described below, this Privacy Policy also applies to your other interactions with the Action Network Group, such as when you purchase products or services, sign up for a newsletter or provide information to the Action Network Group at a trade show or other event.
By visiting our Site or submitting your Personal Information (as defined below) to us by any means, you are giving your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please exit our Site and do not provide Personal Information to us.
What Information We Collect:
This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to the Action Network Group and its affiliates (or carefully selected third parties acting on the Action Network Group’s and its affiliates’ behalf), including Personal Information (as defined below). “Personal Information” is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual, such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number(s), and credit card information. You do not need to provide us Personal Information to simply browse our Site. In addition, we use web analytics tools to gather anonymous, aggregated demographic information by tracking IP addresses and other types of Traffic Data (as defined below). We may use this anonymous, aggregated demographic information and share it with third parties to better understand users’ activity on our Site and provide services to our visitors. To learn more about our collection and use of Traffic Data, see the “Traffic Data” section below.
The Action Network Group may collect Personal Information and Traffic Data when:
you make purchases of products or services;
you request support for the Action Network Group’s products or services;
you create a user account (e.g., login user name and password) on the Site;
you register for webcasts, seminars or roundtables;
you request information or materials (e.g., whitepapers or newsletters);
you participate in surveys and evaluations;
you participate in promotions, contests or giveaways, which we may offer from time to time;
you apply for a job, or submit your resume to the Action Network Group; or
you submit questions or comments to us.
The Action Network Group may also collect Personal Information from individuals (with their consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions.
The types of Personal Information and Traffic Data collected may include (but are not limited to), as applicable:
your first and last name;
your title and your company’s name;
your home, billing, or other physical address (including street name, name of a city or town, state/province, postal code);
your e-mail address;
your telephone number;
(for job applicants submitting electronic information) your educational background, employment experience, and job interest;
any other identifier that permits the Action Network Group to make physical or online contact with you;
any information that the Action Network Group collects online from you and maintains in association with your account, such as: (a) your username, (b) your password, and/or (c) your credit card account information.
Use of Your Information:
Generally
The Action Network Group collects and uses your Personal Information and Traffic Data to operate and improve its Site and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the Site or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.
We also use your Personal Information and Traffic Data to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some of the Action Network Group’s services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from the Action Network Group and its affiliates.
Personal Information collected on the Site and services may be stored and processed in the United States both on-premises and in the cloud, and by using the Site, product or service, you consent to any such transfer of information.
Sale or Acquisition of Assets
If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, your Personal Information will be one of the transferred assets. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal Information in the same manner required by our Privacy Policy in effect at that time. The provisions of this paragraph will apply also if we are sold as a part of bankruptcy proceedings.
If we purchase a business, the Personal Information received with that business will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy in effect at that time, so long as it is practicable and permissible to do so.
Use by Third Parties
From time to time, we may use your Personal Information and Traffic Data: (a) if we need to respond to valid legal process, including, but not limited to, a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required to do so by law; or (b) if we deem it necessary to disclose Personal Information or Traffic Data, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to protect our rights or interests. We may also exchange Personal Information with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.
The Action Network Group may share Personal Information and Traffic Data with companies working on our behalf and to our affiliated companies. In addition, some services of the Action Network Group may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both the Action Network Group and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services.
In some cases the Action Network Group uses contractors to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. The Action Network Group may also allow carefully selected partners to participate in limited marketing campaigns solely to promote the Action Network Group’s products and services to you.
If you request something from the Site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, such as the Action Network Group’s business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes, which may require us to engage third-party service providers.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the Personal Information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
We do not endorse specific third parties or their goods or services, regardless of whether such third parties offer goods or services on the Site from time to time. Any relationship between you and such third parties will be governed exclusively by the terms offered by the third party and agreed to by you. If you provide these third parties with any Personal Information or other information, their use of such information will be subject to their privacy policies, if any, and will not be governed by this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you accept third-party goods or services advertised on the Site, a third party may be able to determine that you have a relationship with us (e.g., if the offer is made only through the Site).
Except as set forth herein, unless you have provided consent, the Action Network Group will not (a) sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to third parties, and (b) disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Your Username and URL
Please note that when you select a username, you are assigned a unique public URL based on your username. This URL is open to the public and locatable by the public. Therefore, any sports picks you post on your page will be available to the public, unless you select the option to make your picks "private". If you select "private", the information you post about your sports picks will not be made publicly available.

If you choose to link your third party accounts to your Action Network Group account, Action Network Group may collect data associated with that account, including your wager data (i.e. wagers place, wager amount, position, wager type, vigorish and odds). Once linked, this data is integrated into the Site and cannot be removed unless individually and manually deleted by you.
Your Choices:
The Action Network Group provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your Personal Information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.
If you do not wish to continue receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., email messages), you can opt-out of receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the materials.
