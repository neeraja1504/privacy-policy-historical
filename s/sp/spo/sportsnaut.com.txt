SHARING INFORMATION
We may share customer information with Sportsnaut Affiliates, and as described below.
Third Party Marketplaces and Service Providers:
We may disclose your personal information as well as aggregate, anonymous information to third party business partners, marketplaces, and third parties who perform services for us, such as credit card processing, prize fulfillment, delivering packages, sending postal mail, collecting and analyzing data, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing advertising and marketing assistance, including serving ads on our behalf on third party websites and mobile applications and serving ads on behalf of third parties within certain Sportsnaut Offerings.

As Sportsnaut continues to grow, we might sell or buy certain subsidiaries and/or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred assets. Also, in the unlikely event that sportsnaut or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information would in most cases be one of the transferred assets.

We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the Terms of Use or other agreements; if we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose it in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of Sportsnaut, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with entities for fraud detection and protection, and credit risk reduction.

Promotional email communications:
When you subscribe your email address via a Sportsnaut Offering, you may be automatically registered to receive one or more of our promotional e- newsletters. Note that when you provide an email address through a Sportsnaut Offering, we treat that as a request to be enrolled in one of our promotional e-newsletter lists, even if you previously opted out of receiving newsletters from us, but if you change your mind and wish to opt out again, you may do so at any time by clicking the “ unsubscribe ” link at the bottom of any newsletter and then following the instructions provided. If you express interest in a Sportsnaut Offering by clicking on a banner within a newsletter, you may be automatically registered to receive newsletters relating to the Sportsnaut Offering that appeared in the banner.
At any time, you may opt-out of receiving a newsletter by selecting the “ unsubscribe ” link at the bottom of any newsletter. We treat each Sportsnaut Offering individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one Sportsnaut Offering, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so with respect to each individually. You may also contact us at privacy@oointah.com. Please note that we reserve the right to send you non-promotional, account or administrative emails even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-newsletters.
