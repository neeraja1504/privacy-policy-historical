1.4.              Cookies
What are Cookies?
Cookies are essential in order to allow you to login to the Website or Application and for the Website experience.
Most websites you visit will use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling that website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a 'session cookie') or for future visits (using a 'persistent cookie').
A cookie is a simple text file that is issued to your computer when you visit a website and which stores and sometimes tracks information about your use of a website. Each cookie is unique to your browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, the website name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what's in your shopping basket.
All cookies used by SportPursuit are 'first party' cookies. This means that any cookie set on the Website or Application can only be read back from the Website or Application. No other website or application is able to read or access information from any cookie set by the Website or Application. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users, and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies.
Cookies are not programs and therefore cannot contain viruses or other malicious software.
How We Use Cookies
You can find a summary of the various types of cookies we use below. Our cookies are used for 3 types of purpose:
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the Website or Application and use their respective features. Without these cookies you cannot for example log into the Website or Application to access our sales. These cookies are passed under HTTPS in an encrypted format. This provides the most security when identifying you as a user.
Performance Cookies
These cookies let us monitor how the Website and Application are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users. We use this information to maintain, operate and continually improve the user experience for our users on the Website or Application.
For example, these cookies allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages and understand how well these pages work for our users.
We also use Google Analytics and Piwik Pro. Analytics systems are used by many websites to record information about who visits a website. Both Google and Piwik Pro set predominantly first party cookies with expiry dates ranging from 30 minutes to 2 years which do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find out more about how Google and Piwik Pro use their cookies at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html and https://helpcenter-piwik-pro.intercom.help/analytics/manage-and-configure-analytics/piwik-pro-cookies, also see further information in the table below.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow us to:
- record information about choices you've made and allow us to tailor the Website or Application to you, such as by customising elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Website or Application;
- remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
- collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Website or Application (including how long you spend on the Website or Application) and where you have come to the Website or Application from, so that we can improve the Website or Application and learn which parts and which functions of the Website and Application are most popular with users;

1.6.              Legal grounds for our processing of your personal data ****
The basis on which we process your personal data is as follows:
Where it is necessary to obtain your prior consent to the processing concerned in order for us to be allowed to do it, we will obtain and rely on your consent in relation to the processing concerned.
Otherwise, we will process your personal data only where the processing is necessary:
for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract;
for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are a subject; or
for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or another person, provided that this will only be in circumstances in which those legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data (most circumstances in which we process your personal data in relation to a relationship that we have with the person that you work for will fall into this category).
1.7.              Information sharing
We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Website, users of the Applications, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.
We may share your email address, in encrypted form, with Facebook in order to engage in look-a-like targeting. This enables us to reach new people who are likely to be interested in us because they are similar to other customers of ours.
In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party. We may also share any personal information we hold about you amongst our group companies.

Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.
You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. Where sensitive financial information is provided to us, we use encryption software to attempt to prevent unauthorised access to this information being obtained. Other than as set out in Sections 5 and 10 above, we do not have access to or store any confidential information about the means of payment; only PayPal or Amazon, our payment services providers, have access to this information, and it cannot be accessed by any other third party.
We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Website or any Application and any such submission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
