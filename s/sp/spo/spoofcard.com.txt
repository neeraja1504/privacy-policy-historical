What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This policy covers how SpoofCard treats personal information that SpoofCard collects and receives, including via all related websites, networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, and mobile applications (including tablet applications), and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, our “Service”). This includes information related to your past use of SpoofCard products and services, and information about you that is personally identifiable-such as your name, address, email address, IP address and phone number.
This Privacy Policy, however, does not apply to the practices of companies that are not affiliated with SpoofCard.com.
What Information Do We Collect?
We generally act as the data controller of your information, We collect the following types of information.
Information You Provide. When you register for or use the Service, SpoofCard.com collects what is generally called “personally identifiable information," “personal information,” or “personal data.” All these terms refer to information that specifically relates to or identifies a particular individual. Personal information also includes information that when linked to other information identifies a specific individual. When you register, we ask for a limited amount of personal information, including but not limited to, your phone number and payment information. When you sign into our Service, you are not anonymous to us. SpoofCard also collects information about your transactions with us, including information about your use of our Service.
“Cookies" Information. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Consult your device's web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
“Automatically Collected" Information. If you consent, when you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or APIs. This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service.

This information is gathered from all users.
Location Information. If you use our Service, we may receive your generic location (such as city or neighborhood) or, with your consent, precise geographic location data from your mobile device when the app is running and when it is not running. We may, for example, receive this information when you are in proximity to certain beacons, choose to publish your location, or in your comments or communications with us.

By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your personal information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, including your name and email address, and to use and disclose such information in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service.

We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:
We work with third party service providers that provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, data transmission, data processing, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your information as part of providing those services for us. However, we limit the personal information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions. In addition, they agree by contract to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

In the event SpoofCard is acquired by or merged with another company, the terms of this Privacy Policy shall continue to apply. In this event, SpoofCard will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Third-Party Services
The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties that are not affiliated with SpoofCard or the Service.

Confidentiality And Security
SpoofCard limits internal access to your personal information to employees who we reasonably believe require this information in order to do their jobs or to provide products and services to you. We use industry standard measures to help protect the integrity and security of personal information that we collect and maintain. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
