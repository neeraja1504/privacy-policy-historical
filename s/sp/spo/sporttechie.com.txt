We do not store credit/debit card information. This information is shared with our payment processing services to complete a transaction you requested.
We may also collect information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. This is intended to better provide to you our Services. As with all information that we collect from you, we will keep it private and for our own internal purposes only.

How do we share information?
The following provides information about entities with which we may share information. Our practices vary depending on the type of information.
Business Partners. We may share your information with business partners to provide you with services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your information may be shared with that sponsor. You will always be notified that we intend to share your information with a business partner before you elect to sign up for a promotion that so requires. SportTechie is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.
Service Providers. We may share information with vendors providing contractual services to us, such as hosting vendors.
Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services. **  **We may share your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.
Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction. ** ** We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.
