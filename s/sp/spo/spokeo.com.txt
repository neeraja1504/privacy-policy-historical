How Your Spokeo Listing is Made
Spokeo aggregates publicly available information from phone books, social networks, marketing surveys, real estate listings, and other public sources. This third-party data is then indexed through methods similar to those used by Google or Bing to create a listing. Because Spokeo only collects this data and does not create it, we cannot fully guarantee its accuracy. For further information please read our full privacy policy.
Protecting Your Online Identity
All of the information that appears on Spokeo is publicly available and therefore may appear on other sites. To protect your online identity you can use a service like Reputation.com to manage your publicly available information.
Removing Your Listing from Spokeo
Spokeo aggregates publicly available information from third party sources. Therefore, removing a listing from our directory will not remove your information from its original source and therefore your information might still appear on other directory sites.
