Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
Under the 'safe harbor' of the DMCA, SportsViews.com is not liable or responsible for any alleged copyright infringements since all content on SportsViews.com is submitted by its members, and/or other third parties. Regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under local country law or Canadian law, our response to these notices may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or disabling or terminating infringing member accounts. If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the administrator of the affected content so that they may make a counter notification if they choose to exercise that right.
We may also choose to document notices of alleged infringement on which we act. In addition to being forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content, a copy of this legal notice may be sent to a third-party which may publish and/or annotate it. As such, your letter (with your personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling Effects (http://www.chillingeffects.org) for publication. You can see an example of such a publication at http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/notice.cgi?NoticeID=861.
It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. This page describes the information that should be included in these notices. Procedures of submitting notices of alleged infringement to SportsViews.com is very straightforward and aims to reduce the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The notice form below is consistent with the form suggested by the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov) but we will also respond to notices from other jurisdictions as long as they are in English.
Infringement Notification
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written communication setting forth the items specified below, by regular mail and not by email. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights. Indeed, in a recent case (please see http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/ for more information), a company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees. The company agreed to pay over $100,000. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
To expedite our ability to process your request, we will only accept notices in the following format (including section numbers):
Adequately identify in detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon. For example: "The copyrighted material in question can be found at http://www.legal.com/legal_page.html or other adequate information to point out the copyrighted work being infringed upon. For example: "The copyrighted work in question is the "To be or not to see" by Joe Smith, published by Joe Publishing, ISBN #012685678912".
Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above. You must specifically identify each all of the user-submitted content that allegedly contains infringing material. This requires you to provide 2 more descriptions:

The url for all allegedly infringing content.
For example:
* How you found it: Searched "Nova Scotia Dodge Ball League" within SportsViews.com

If you are sending a large number of URLs (over 10) in one removal request, please ALSO send an electronic copy of the notice to support at sportsviews dot com with Subject: DMCA Complaints.
