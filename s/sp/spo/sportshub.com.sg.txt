effectiveness and to let us know which emails and links have been opened and what action
has been taken in relation to those.
(6)         Disclosing and transferring your personal data, in Singapore and overseas
a) We engage external partners to perform various functions for and on our behalf, such as
marketing services, events promotion and sponsoring, ticketing and sales services, as well as
information and communication technology services. Accordingly, we will share your data with
our partners to the extent necessary to administer any products or services you have chosen to
receive from us, as well as for market research and survey purposes.
b) Where we collect your personal data in connection with events organized by our external
partners (e.g. when you purchase tickets through our website for an event organized our external
partner), we may disclose such data to our partners to enable them to administer said events
and, to the extent that you have consented to them doing so, for them to send you information
and updates on their other events or promotions (which may take place in the Singapore
Sportshub or other venues in Singapore, whether or not operated by Sportshub) via your
preferred mode of communication.
c) We will not share or disclose your personal data to any other third parties (whether for
marketing purposes or otherwise) without your consent, save as otherwise required or permitted
by law.
d) Please note that the partners (and, with your consent, any other third parties) to whom we
disclose your information may transfer it to countries outside Singapore. Where this is the case,
we will comply with our obligations under the PDPA and either seek your consent or take
appropriate steps (unless we are deemed to have taken such appropriate steps under the PDPA)
to ensure that the recipients of your personal data outside Singapore are bound by legally
enforceable obligations to provide a standard of protection to your personal data comparable to
the protection provided by the PDPA and other applicable legislation.
(7)         Protecting your data
a) SportsHub uses industry standards efforts to protect the confidentiality of your personal data,
storing data on secure servers and taking other security measures to prevent unauthorised
access, collection, use, disclosure, copying modification, disposal or similar risks in relation to
your data. We regularly review developments in relation to security and encryption
technologies.

b) However, you will realise that no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as
totally secure and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot ensure or warrant the total security of
any information transmitted from our online products or services.
(8)         Accuracy of personal data
(a) We will take reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal data is accurate and complete when we
disclose it to our partners and if we disclose it to other third parties
in accordance with this Policy or if it is likely to be used by us to make a decision affecting you.
(b) Please note that, in most circumstances, we will presume that personal data directly provided from
you will be accurate and complete. However, depending on the circumstances, we may decide to contact
you to ensure that this is the case or to ask that you verify that the data we hold in relation to you is up
to date.
(9)         Retention of personal data
a) We will only hold your personal data for as long as required for the purposes for which it was
collected or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
b) We will regularly review and assess whether personal data can legitimately be retained, having
regard to the purpose for which it was collected and any other legal or business purposes for
which retention may be necessary.
c) Where we are satisfied that we no longer need to retain your personal data, we will take prompt
action to ensure that we will no longer hold on to it, either by destroying or removing your data
from our systems, files and other records completely and permanently or by removing any
identifying information so that it has become anonymised.
(10)        Request to access and correct your personal data
a)          Access to personal data
i.      You may request access to what personal data we hold in relation to you, as well as information
about how we may have used or disclosed your personal data to third parties in the past twelve
months, save where we are not required to do so by law (for example, where doing so would
necessarily reveal personal data about other individuals, where investigations or proceedings
are ongoing or where this would threaten other individuals’ health or safety).
ii.      We will carefully review any data access request we receive from you. Please note that we may
decide to reject your request if we have determined that the burden or expense of providing it
would be unreasonable to us or disproportionate to your interests, if your request concerns
information that is trivial, does not exist or cannot be found or it otherwise frivolous or
vexatious. Accordingly, when making any data access request from us, we recommend that you
set out the circumstances and reasons for your request in as much detail as possible to enable
us to properly assess the matter.
iii.      Please note that we expressly reserves the right to charge an administrative fee in relation to
any request you make to access personal data we hold and/or have disclosed to third parties in
relation to you in the past twelve (12) months. If we decide to do so, we will inform you of the
fee we will charge in relation to your request beforehand and we will only proceed once we
have received confirmation from you to that effect.
(b)      Correction of personal data

K:\2. Compliance\8. PDPA (see Workshops and QMS)\1. Privacy Policy\1. Word and PDF final
You may also request that we correct any errors or omissions with regards to your personal data
and if so, we will normally ensure that this is made as soon as practicable, save where we are
satisfied on reasonable grounds that such correction should not be made or where we are not
required to do so by law.
(c)         Timing of response to data access and correction requests
i.      We will endeavour to respond to your data access and/or correction requests, where applicable,
within thirty (30) days of your request.
ii.      Where we are unable to do so, we will, within that timeframe, inform you of this and of the
reason(s) for our delay and we will give you an estimated timeframe for our response.
iii.      In the event where a request is received via e-mail, the identity of the person making the request
shall be verified by SportsHub before proceeding to make the correction.
(11)        Withdrawing consent
(a) Withdrawing consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data
i.      You may withdraw your consent to us and/or our partners collecting, using and/or disclosing
your personal data at any time by contacting our Data Protection Officer (see below).
ii.      We will inform you of the likely consequences of us doing so. We will also inform our partners
of your request and will ensure that we and our partners comply with your request, save where
otherwise permitted or required by law. Please note that we will then delete and personal data
we hold about you in accordance with the retention principles set out in this Policy.
(b) Withdrawing consent to receive marketing updates
i.      If you had previously subscribed to receive information on shows, events, activities and
promotions taking place at the SportsHub from us or our partners and no longer wish to be on
our or our partners’ mailing lists, you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the
“unsubscribe link” or by contacting our Data Protection Officer (see below).
ii.      If you had previously indicated that you wished to receive information on shows, events,
activities, and promotions taking place at other Singapore venues from our partners and you
no longer wish to receive such information from them, you will need to get in touch with our
partners directly to let them know, either by visiting the privacy policy of their website(s) or
by responding to any unsubscribe links to marketing materials which they will be sending
you.
(12)        Individual Rights for Users in the European Economic Area
a) If you are located in the European Economic Area, you may seek confirmation regarding
whether SportsHub is processing your personal data, request access to your personal data and
ask that we correct, amend, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. In addition, you
may object to SportsHub’s processing of your personal data at any time. However, please note
that doing so may impact your ability to access and use SportsHub’s facilities, sites, and/or
services.
b) While SportsHub will make reasonable efforts to provide you with access to your personal data,
there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide such access, including but not
limited to: where the information in question is legally privileged, would compromise the
