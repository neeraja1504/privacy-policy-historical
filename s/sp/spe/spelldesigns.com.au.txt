Depending on the applicable state of the art, the implementation costs, the nature, context and purposes of the processing as well as the possible corresponding risks, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of your personal data adapted to the risks, in order to avoid any loss, misuse, alteration or deletion of your personal data. We have implemented information security measures that contain administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard your personal data. Even though we have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to protect this information in the conditions set out in this Section, no company, including us, can fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal data. Please understand that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. If we learn of a data security systems breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we shall communicate the security data breach to you without undue delay. By using the Site or providing personal data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site. We may post a notice via the Site if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.

Opt-Out of Marketing Emails and Texts: For email marketing, you will have an opportunity to change your subscription preferences by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in all promotional emails sent by us or on our behalf. Please note that while we honour all subscription requests as timely as possible, it may take a short time to become effective.

Thus, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by phone, email or regular mail if we have questions about your order. Additionally, an opt-out will not remove you from messages that we are required to send under relevant laws or regulations. You may ask us not to contact you by text message at any time by responding to a text message after it is received. For automated text messages, you will have the opportunity to opt-out by replying “STOP” to any message received. Please note that you hereby consent to receiving a confirmatory message in response to any opt-out request.

Is Information Collected From Minors Under The Age of 13?
Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us. The Site is directed toward a general audience and is not directed at nor intended for use by children. We do have our Little Gypsies range of children’s clothing, but our expectation and experience is that parents or guardians shop for this for their children. We do not knowingly collect or intend to collect personal data from anyone who is under the age of 13 unless consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the minor. In the absence of such a consent or authorization, if you are under the age of 13, you should not provide any personal data to us and you should use the Site only with the knowledge, permission and involvement of a parent or the holder of parental responsibility. We encourage parents and holder of the parental responsibility to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data through the Site. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that information from our databases.
Services to Minors under 13
Our services are not intended to be used by minors under the age of 13 years old and are exclusively provided to persons over the age of 13 and enjoying legal capacity. We will not knowingly collect or process personal data from minors under the age of 13. Should we be made aware of data collection from minors through our Services, we will take all appropriate steps to delete these personal data from our servers.
Transfers of Personal Data Outside the European Union?
If you are visiting our Site, please be aware that you may send information (including personal data) outside the European Union and especially to Australia, Canada, the USA or elsewhere where some of our servers may be located. We will hold and process your personal data in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations regarding these transfers. To this end, we will accomplish any appropriate formalities to authorize this transfer. By using our Site, you thereby consent to this Data Transfer.
How Will I Be Informed About Changes Regarding This Privacy Policy?
The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result (and for other business and/or technological reasons), it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update, change, amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any personal data.
If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy (as determined by us), we will post a notice on the Site notifying users of the changes and providing an opportunity for you to take action relative to those changes prior to their implementation. In some cases, we also may send an email notifying registered user of any upcoming changes.

If we are unable to address your issue immediately, we will respond as soon as possible.
By virtue of the European General Data Protection Regulation n°2016/679 (“GDPR”), any user residing within a Member State of the European Union has the right to access, rectify and oppose, to the processing of his/her personal data and a right to erasure, in the conditions set out in the GDPR.

If there is a dispute regarding the processing of your personal data, you may send your claim to us by contacting us using the information set out in the section “Who is the data controller?” of this Policy. We will try to find a satisfactory solution for you to ensure compliance to the applicable regulations and to this Policy. In the absence of a response from us, or should the dispute remain in spite of our remediation proposal, you may submit your claim to the competent data protection authority. For example, in the UK, this data protection authority is the “Information Commissioner’s Office”.
How long do we keep your information?
We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations.
