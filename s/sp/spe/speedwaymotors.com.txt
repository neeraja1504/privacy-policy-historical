Privacy
What personally identifiable information is being collected?
You may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information when you visit the Speedway Motors website in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested. For example, when you order a product we may ask you to become a registered user of our site. You will be asked for your shipping and billing addresses, your email address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives we will store a record of your request along with your email address. Additionally, our web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as your computer's IP address and which pages you visited. That information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you. We also collect demographic and interest information (such as age, gender and interests) about you using Google Analytics. This allows us to present specific products and services to you based on who you are and what you like.
How is the information being used?
The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested or in which we think that you might have an interest. It is also used to improve the content of our website, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our website.
With whom do we share your information?
We occasionally need to share information with third parties in order to operate this website and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested. We may transmit your personal information to service providers who assist us in processing orders, shipping products, processing payment information, sending catalogs, conducting surveys, processing job applications, and sending emails and newsletters. We have agreements with these service providers that they will protect your privacy in accordance with our standard Privacy Statement. Some of those organizations may have their own privacy statements which may give you additional protections. You are encouraged to read those statements when presented.
How do I access, update, or delete my personally identifiable information?
If you are a registered user of the website, you can manage many aspects of your registration information. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before changes can be made. The online registration area will also permit you to exercise control over the use of your email address, allowing you to opt-out of future email messages from this website. Due to various legal and recordkeeping requirements, however, we may be required to maintain records of your purchases or other activities on this website. However, you will always be permitted to opt-out of any marketing uses of your personal information. If you prefer to manage your personal information via other means, you may contact us by postal mail at:
Speedway Motors, Inc. 340 Victory Lane Lincoln, NE 68528 sales@speedwaymotors.com
What information will be disclosed if required by law?
If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.

Security
What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?
Speedway Motors values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Speedway Motors.
Secure Ordering Process Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Speedway Motors website uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Firefox, Netscape, and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is not secure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.
Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse.
If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 800.979.0122. Our fax number for orders is 800.768.3733. Or send your order to:
Speedway Motors, Inc. Attn: Order Processing 340 Victory Lane Lincoln, NE 68528
If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 800.979.0122 or email Customer Service.
Children
In accordance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without the verifiable permission of a parent or guardian. If you are under age 13, you are welcome to browse our website. However, you are not permitted to use any of the features of our site that require the collection of any personally identifiable information. If we determine that we have erroneously collected a child's information, we will immediately undertake to delete that data from our records.
