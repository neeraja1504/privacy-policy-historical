Privacy - Splashtop Inc.
Introduction
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) details Splashtop Inc.’s (“Splashtop”) commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our Websites and who register to use the products and Service(s) (as defined below) which we market for subscription (“Subscriber”). For the purposes of this Policy, the term, “Websites”, shall refer collectively to www.splashtop.com as well as the other websites that the Splashtop operates and that link to this Policy.
At Splashtop, we know that you care how information about you is collected, used, or shared. This Policy explains what information of yours may be collected by Splashtop through its family of products and/or related services (each a “Service” or the “Services”) and through the Websites, and how the information will be used. We will not use your information in any way except as described in this Policy.
Scope of This Policy
In this Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, or location data. The use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which the Subscribers has engaged.
Our Websites may contain links to other websites and the information practices and the content of such other websites are governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any such other websites to understand their information practices.
We have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with our Subscriber’s use of our Services. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber while using our Services (such as a customer of one of our Subscribers who are, for example, a Managed Service Provider or an IT support technician) and would either like to amend your contact information or no longer wish to be contacted by one of our Subscribers that use our Services, please contact the Subscriber that you interact with directly.
Acceptance of the Privacy Policy
This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Splashtop Terms of Service for use of our Services, which are available at https://www.splashtop.com/terms/splashtop, and Splashtop Terms of Use for use of our Websites, which are available at https://www.splashtop.com/terms. By visiting and using the Websites or Services, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this Policy, and you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and other non-personally identifying information by Splashtop in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Websites or the Services.
Privacy Policy Updates
Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, we may need to update this Policy from time to time. If so, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our Websites located at https://www.splashtop.com/privacy. We may also send registered users of the Websites email notifications notifying such users of any changes to the Policy. If any change is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using the Websites and the Services. If you do not cease using the Websites and the Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes.
Information We Collect From You on our Websites
You can generally visit our Websites without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain instances, you may be given the option to fill out a service registration, complete a survey or other form which could contain personally identifiable information, such as user identification name, an email address, and/or any other information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us.
Whenever you visit a Splashtop web page, your browser may send certain information to our server, which we record. This information may include the URL of the referring web page, your browser, OS type, as well as the information set forth below:
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
We and our authorized partners may use cookies and other information gathering technologies to provide us with personal information, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. For detailed information about the use of cookies in the Websites, please read and review our Cookie Policy which can be found at https://www.splashtop.com/cookie-policy.
We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may also use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking https://preferences-mgr.truste.com (or if located in the European Union you may opt-in the use of cookies, by clicking https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).
We may use web beacons, tags and scripts on our Websites or in email we send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
We may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. For further information on how to manage Flash LSOs please visit https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve our Websites and Services. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Policy.

We collect analytics information when you use the Websites to help us improve them. We may also share anonymous data about your actions on our Websites with third-party service providers of analytics services.
We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile application on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the mobile application, the events that occur within the mobile application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the mobile application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

If you sign-up for a free trial Account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services.

Social Media Widgets:
The Websites may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the companies that provide them.
Information From Third Party Services:
We may also obtain other information, including personal information, from third parties. For example, we may have access to device information from a third party RMM (remote monitoring and management) service who integrates with our Services.

You should check your privacy settings on these third party services to understand and change the information sent to us through these services.
