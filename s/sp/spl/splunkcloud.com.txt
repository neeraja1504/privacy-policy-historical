IP Addresses. Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The Splunk online services automatically identify, capture, and log IP addresses in our server log files whenever you use them, along with the time of your visit and the page(s) that you visited.  Splunk uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the services, track user movement, ensure the security of your interaction and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Links to Other Parties
The Services may link to other companies. This Privacy Policy does not address, and Splunk is not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any sites and/or services to which the Services contain a link or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer. The inclusion of a link within the Splunk Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or our affiliates. Splunk encourages you to review the privacy policies and learn about the privacy practices of those companies whose websites you choose to visit.
Apps and other Third Party Content.   The Splunk product is extendible through the use of software called apps and add-ons.  These extensions are versatile, and have access to a broad set of web technologies, including some that could be used to track your usage or collect Personal Information. Additionally, the Splunk product ships with a fully functional web and application server that can be extended by you or by third party software. This Privacy Policy does not extend to third party software, even if packaged by Splunk or offered through a Splunk web property. While Splunk makes reasonable efforts to encourage app developers to follow privacy guidelines that meet or exceed what is described in this policy, we cannot and do not compel them to do so.  When choosing to use apps, add-ons or other third party extensions, you are entering into a license agreement with those parties.  You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy of the organization or individual providing you with software that runs in or with your Splunk product.
