Data protection
Splendia, a subsidiary of the Voyage Privé Group, implements all technical and organizational measures necessary to protect the personal data we hold against any access, modification, destruction or disclosure. To achieve this, we have implemented the following security measures in particular:
- Our internal computer network, our servers and the Site are subject to technical measures that enable us to guarantee the highest degree of security for your personal data.
- We regularly have our security measures audited to ensure their effectiveness.
- Access to your personal data is strictly reserved to VPG Group employees and subcontractors, only for the necessary processing and for which you have given your consent.
- Any illegal intrusion into our database gives rise to an immediate alert and to the implementation of the necessary actions.
Is your data shared?
Given the nature of our activity and the use of this website, if you book a hotel room and in order to be able to access your request, Splendia will have to communicate your personal data to the chosen hotel as well as to the suppliers concerned by your booking in order to ensure the smooth processing of your order. In this context, your personal data may be transferred to a third country (outside the European Economic Area). If you book a stay in a country outside the EEA, the data required to process your booking will be transmitted to our suppliers.
Some third countries may provide a lower level of protection for your personal data than that guaranteed by European Union law. In this case, Splendia undertakes to take all appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is protected and processed in accordance with European Union law, in particular by implementing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or contractual clauses previously authorised by the competent authority.
In addition, and in order to implement the personalization of your experience, we collaborate with service providers to whom we delegate the sending of communications or the collection and processing of data so that they can be analyzed and enable us to improve our service offering or personalize our communications. Within this framework, we only transmit to them the data necessary and sufficient for the execution of their mission. Our service providers are also contractually obliged to ensure that the personal data received are processed only within the defined framework and in compliance with regulations.
For the purpose of retargeting advertising by Splendia, we may also transmit some of your data to advertising partners or platforms, including the products you have viewed on our site, the details of your quotes or reservations (including destination, period of stay, number of people), the unique identifier of your mobile device and operating system, and in some cases your encrypted email address in a highly secure format.
With the exception of the cases mentioned above, we will not communicate any data concerning you without your agreement, except in the case of a legal constraint (in the case for example of a judicial order or for purposes of prevention of fraud and other crimes).
How long is your data kept?
The personal data that you communicate to us relating to your member account, your reservations, as well as your navigation data are kept for a period of 5 years from your last activity on the Site from the date of the end of your last stay. For accounting and tax purposes, some personal data may be retained for up to 10 years after your reservation.
At the end of this period, your Splendia member account will be automatically deactivated and you will have to create a new one if you wish to benefit from our services.
Security of your personal data
At Splendia, we follow strict security procedures regarding the retention and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect them from accidental loss, destruction or alteration. The data you provide to us is protected by SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol. SSL is the method used to encrypt credit card information and data so that it can be transferred securely over the Internet.
All payment data is transmitted via a secure connection (Secure Socket Layer-SSL) through an infrastructure secured by Thawte and stored in accordance with Payment Card Industry Data Security (PCI DSS) Service Provider Level 1 standards.
We may share your information with trusted third parties for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We require all third parties to put in place appropriate technical and operational security measures to protect your personal data, in accordance with the data protection laws enshrined in French law and European Community law.
