Privacy Statement | SplashData
Salexo Software Inc. (d/b/a SplashData) recognizes the critical importance of privacy. After all, security and privacy are central to who we are as a company. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use SplashData’s online services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document).
SplashData never rents or exchanges our electronic mailing lists with any third parties. SplashData will not disclose any of your electronic contact information except when we have your explicit permission.
We may occasionally send you email about product updates or offers and services that we feel might be of interest to you. Only SplashData will send you these email messages and only if you do not object to these messages. We use best efforts to request your permissions explicitly when you sign up for Services.
If you do not want to receive such messages, please use the Unsubscribe link included at the bottom of all of our mailings. Once you are unsubscribed, you will no longer receive such offers or mailings.
By using the Services, you consent to the information practices described in this policy. Keep in mind that your use of the Services is also subject to, and controlled by, the Terms and Conditions of the particular Services you are using.
SplashData collects personal information when you register for an account for any Service or otherwise voluntarily provide such information.
Free or Trial Account - When you sign up for an account, we ask you to select a user name and a password. This information is stored on our servers.
Registered Account – Upon payment of applicable fees for some Services, you can upgrade to a Registered Account and we may request some other information, including your name, credit card details and a billing address. Your name, address and payment information will be used for administrative purposes only.
Note that any information you encrypt using a secure service like SplashID or TeamsID will remain private – such records cannot be unencrypted by SplashData using your user name or any other information we store.
Log Information - When you use SplashData services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
User communications - When you send email or other communication to SplashData, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
Links - SplashData may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of the service.
Uses of collected information - We use personal information such as your name and email address solely to provide the services you’ve requested. We may also use personal information for internal auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve SplashData technologies and services. We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of SplashData. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we use our best efforts to require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Minimum level of collected information - We ask only for personal information that is strictly necessary to provide the Services and perform administrative tasks.
Information sharing - SplashData shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of SplashData only when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to:
satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; or
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
SplashData may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you individually.
If SplashData becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Accessing and updating personal information - When you use SplashData services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process certain requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any validated request to correct or remove personal information will be honored to the best of our abilities.
Security - We employ commercially reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. Your personal data will be stored within a database that is located behind a firewall for added security. The server housing the database is physically protected at a secure data center. Any transmission to the SplashData web site or Services of sensitive and credit card information uses encryption.
Enforcement - SplashData regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or SplashData’s treatment of personal information by contacting us here. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is SplashData’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
Changes to this policy - Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page: www.splashdata.com/privacy
