However there may be circumstances when you may be asked or choose to provide personal information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally including, but not limited to, your name, home address, e-mail address, gender, and date of birth. Some areas of this Site may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions or tips/pointers) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed what personal information is required and what information is optional when asked to submit personal information to us. By submitting personal information to Heartland at this Site, you hereby consent to Heartland’s collection, use and disclosure of such personal information.
We may combine the personal information you submit directly through this Site with other personal information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline. We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, such as other companies, divisions, parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies of Heartland, publicly available information sources (including information from your publicly available social media profiles), and other third parties.
You should be aware that when personal information is voluntarily disclosed (e.g., your name, e-mail address, etc.) in any public areas on this Site (such as a message board or blog), that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Any submissions to public areas on this Site are accepted with the understanding that they are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any public submissions.
