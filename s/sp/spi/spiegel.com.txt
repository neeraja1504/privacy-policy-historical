Third party merchants "Presented by Spiegel"
If you make a purchase from a Merchant Site with a link originating from the Spiegel site or a Merchant catalog or website "presented by" Spiegel, the information you provide to that Merchant, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the Merchant and not to Spiegel. Providing this information to the Merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the Merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Spiegel. You should also know that these Merchants have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Spiegel privacy statement.
Merchants on the Spiegel site and those Merchants, who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Spiegel, have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Merchants appearing on Spiegel or other Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Spiegel and their privacy policies, please see the Merchant's home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant.
Merchants that have links on the Spiegel site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these Merchants are not covered by the Spiegel privacy statement.

How do you know your information is secure?
When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon in your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information on our site. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen on our site.
We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure.
Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.

From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Statement.

Conflict in terms
It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
