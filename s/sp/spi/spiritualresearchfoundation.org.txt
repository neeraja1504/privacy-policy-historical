If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.
2.2 Non-Confidential Information
We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our services, such as our comments functionality (where you authorise the publication of the comment) and blogs herein after referred to as Non-Confidential Information.
The third-party services that SSRF uses are GDPR compliant, and the information shared with these services is on a double opt-in basis which also has your consent through the medium of email and/or a web-form. These services have an easy opt-out method, e.g. newsletter subscription. All these services maintain the non-confidential information such as IP address only for certain duration, after which it gets deleted from their systems. Examples include statistical data on the systems.
2.3 Non-personally-identifiable information
Through third party software, we also collect aggregate, non-personally-identifiable information on users by recording the IP address from the computers of visitors to our site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. Web servers, or the computers that provide the web pages to your computer for you to view, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you use your computer to request to view a page from a server, that server logs your IP address. SSRF does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. Your visit to the Site will be logged; however, you will remain anonymous to us unless you choose to share information with us. We track the number of people that view each page of our website to better understand which features are most popular and best meet the needs of our visitors.
To the extent this information does not constitute personal information, the National Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.

5 Cookies and Tracking
What is a cookie?: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive.
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the Site to your interests.
What do we store in a cookie?: We do not store any confidential information in a cookie, whatever information is stored is just to facilitate your interaction with us, to be able to identify you and correspond with you. Some data that we store in a cookie is your encrypted name, encrypted password, and language preference. The cookie gets deleted when you choose to logout from our website or the cookie itself gets expired. If you have chosen to remember your credentials while loggin in, then that data gets stored in your browser preferences. In any case, we do not store such data in our systems.
Control over a cookie: Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last option means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Site’s features. Each Internet browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. During the course of any visit to SSRF, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
How does the SSRF use your cookies: Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. In our effort to provide you with services customised to your interests, we use “cookies” to assist in the collection of information.
