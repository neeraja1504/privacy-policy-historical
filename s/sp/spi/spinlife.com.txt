SpinLife® Privacy Policy
At SpinLife®, we are committed to protecting your privacy both before and after the purchase process. We use the information we collect to process your medical equipment orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
When you register, we need only a name and email address, plus information that helps us to customize your on-line experience toward your specific needs and interests.
Product Reviews can only be submitted by customers who have actually purchased the product at SpinLife. Customers will be invited to submit a review on most products about 30 days after their purchase.
We may personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about the products that might be of interest to you.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new SpinLife.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit the registration page to change your preferences. Make sure to change your preferences for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.
How does SpinLife ® protect customer information?
When you place orders we offer the use of a secure server. The information you provide to us is sent via a secure socket layer (SSL) transmission. Furthermore, all of this data is protected against unauthorized access, and is stored with 128 bit encryption on our servers, the strongest industry standard encryption.
