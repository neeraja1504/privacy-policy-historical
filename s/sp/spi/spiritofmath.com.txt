The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what personal information we collect about students and their parents or guardians, how we use it, whether we disclose it to anybody else, how long we keep it, and how you can request access to your personal information or obtain more information about the Company’s privacy policies and procedures.
What Personal Information Does the Company Collect and Why?
The Company, through its network of company-owned and franchised local Spirit of Math campuses, collects personal information of its students in the normal course of doing business. “Personal information” is any information that could be used to identify a student and, depending on the nature of your interaction with us, may include the following (“Personal Information”):

E-mail address;
Payment information, including credit card numbers where used as a form of payment;
Educational background, records and related information;
Medical information that you may provide.
Providing your Personal Information, either in person, by telephone, or online, constitutes your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such Personal Information by the Company for the purpose of providing the relevant services. Personal Information is collected only with the consent of a parent or guardian, and completion of the Registration Form indicates your consent to collection of a student’s Personal Information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
The Company may use your Personal Information to provide you with program services, enrichment tools and information. For example, the Company may:

Provide you with information and updates regarding programs or materials that the local Spirit of Math Schools have to offer and which the Company and the local Spirit of Math campus think will interest you;
Respond to your requests for information, services and products;
Improve the Company’s and the local Spirit of Math campus services to better understand and meet educational enrichments needs.
The Registration form requests permission to use students photographs for promotional and for training Purposes, which requires your initials for each purpose, along with your signature and the date. In limited circumstances, the Company may contact you and ask for your permission to use a name of a student in its marketing. This will only be done with your express consent and signature, and normally would be used only when listing awards and achievements, and for the use of a partial name in testimonials.
Does the Company Disclose Personal Information?
The Company does not sell your Personal Information to third parties. However, the Company may, on occasion, share some or all of your Personal Information with third parties for the purposes set out above. For example, Personal information may be shared:

Please note that your Personal Information will, upon any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, be transferred to a purchaser agreeing to use your Personal Information for the same purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Similarly, in the event of the termination, dissolution, sale or reorganization of a local Spirit of Math campus/franchise, Personal Information will revert to the Company for potential transfer to a new Spirit of Math Campus.
