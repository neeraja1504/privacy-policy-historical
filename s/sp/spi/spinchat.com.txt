2.2 Advertising placements
spinchat.com may use age, gender and city/state specified by the user to decide which advertisement should be displayed. The user has the possibility to deactivate this personalized advertising via the [prefs:]] on spinchat.com. In no case, however, will this data be passed on directly to other companies.

We use third parties to serve ads. These third party providers also learn the current IP address of the user without assignment to their personal data, and can store cookies in the userâs browser.

Google LLC
Our site uses Google AdSense to market space for third-party ads and advertising networks. These ads are displayed in various places on this website.
This enables the display of interest-based advertising by automatically assigning a pseudonymous user ID, with the help of which the interests are determined on the basis of visits to this and other websites.
After our use of Google AdSense has ended, the data collected in this context will be deleted.
Google AdSense is a service of Google LLC. (www.google.com)
Google LLC is headquartered in the USA. There is a decree of appropriateness by the European Commission for this country. This goes back to the EU US Privacy Shield, under which Google LLC is certified. A current certificate can be viewed here: https://www.privacyshield.gov/list

2.3 Videos and graphics of external providers
Users have the possibility to embed videos and graphics of external providers on this website. By embedding such contents, the provider's servers are called due to technical reasons. For the use of data of your browser or deviceby using such a web page, we refer to the privacy policy of the respective providers. e.g. YouTube resp. Google or Vimeo.
3. Access data
You can visit our websites without providing any personal information.
Whenever users call individual pages, or log in or out, spinchat.com stores the current IP address, the name of the application used for access, as well as name and status of the requested file assigned to the pseudonym chosen by the user. Text publications in public chat rooms (not dialogs) are recorded.
These access data are evaluated in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR for the protection of our legitimate interests, which predominate within the scope of a weighing of interests, exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free operation of the site, optimizing our software and identifying and tracking inadmissible access attempts, for maintaining the terms of use and improving our offer. Under no circumstances will this data be used commercially or to create personality profiles.
The log files concerning website visits will, if no preliminary proceedings are pending, be deleted after 7 days; other log files such as the log-in/log-out or the public chat rooms log files will, if no preliminary proceedings are pending, be deleted no later than 3 months after their collection.
If dialog partners do not report abuse using the function provided in the dialog window, private dialogs are not saved permanently and cannot be viewed by spinchat.com employees. If one of the dialog participants reports an abuse via the function provided for this purpose in the dialog window, the last 30 minutes of this dialog are stored forgery-proof from the chat serverâs volatile main memory into the database as an abuse report.
Users also have the possibility to report abuse in other services in spinchat.com (e.g. dialogs/messages/profiles). Abuse reports are viewed by spinchat.com employees, checked and - if appropriate - forwarded to investigative authorities.
If the user buys optional offers (e.g. VIP or spin points), the corresponding payment data will be stored as long as necessary for processing the payment process; in the case of standing orders, until the user stops the standing order or deletes his registered account.
4. Correction and deletion of data
The user has the possibility to change their entered data at any time, with the exception of the telephone number they might have entered for the registration process, their gender and date of birth. If you want to change the gender or date of birth in your profile, please contact our customer service.
Consent to this privacy policy can be revoked by the user using the function provided by spinchat.com for complete Deletion of their registration and their data.
Profile details and photos will be completely removed upon deletion. Content posted by the user in public areas, e.g. forum posts, will remain - without the personal data from the profile. Messages sent to other users, such as dialogs, e-mails, guestbook entries or gifts, are retained by these users. Public contributions in which the user has inadvertently disclosed sensitive/personal data can, however, be subsequently removed by contacting our customer service stating the URL to be removed exactly.
The data of users who are banned and blocked by SPiN AG will be retained within a 30-day period during which such a block can still be reversed if it is based on an error. After expiry of this period, the user's profile details and photos will be automatically deleted as after a self-initiated deletion; however, we reserve the right, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR, to protect our legitimate interests, which predominate in the context of a weighing of interests, to store data which are necessary to maintain the block itself, such as the pseudonym, email address and telephone number used for registration beyond this period, whereby this data will under no circumstances be used in any other way than to maintain the ban.
5. Transmission of data
Depending on which payment service provider you select in the order process, we pass on the payment data collected for the processing of payments to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there. In this case, you must log in to the payment service provider with your access data during the ordering process. The data protection declaration of the respective payment service provider applies in this respect.
