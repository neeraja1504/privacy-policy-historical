Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties
Preston Media does not permit contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers to disclose Personally-Identifying Information received from Preston Media, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves.

Cookies, Shared Objects and Web Beacons
Preston Media may set and access "cookies", Web Beacons or Shared Objects on your computer.
"Cookies" are strings of information that a website stores on a userâ€™s computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the website. This unique number identifies your web browser to our computer system. A cookie will not allow a website to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your web browser when you visit the Preston Media Network. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major Web sites. It is possible to adjust your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that the Preston Media Network may not function Properly without the aid of cookies. Therefore, users who refuse or limit cookies assume all responsibility for any loss of functionality.
"Shared Objects" are used to store data on your computer in much the same way that data is stored in a cookie created through a web browser. Various uses of Shared Objects include remembering a user's favorite color, or the last frame of a movie watched. The data can only be read by movies originating from the same domain that created the Shared Object. Shared Objects cannot remember a user's e-mail address or other personal information unless they willingly provide such information.
"Web Beacons" are small image files that we may place on Web pages and within certain email. Working in conjunction with cookies, Web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use Web Beacons to let us know how many people opened certain types of email. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable information. Keep in mind that any image file on a Web page can act as a Web Beacon. Third-party advertisers may use Web Beacons in their advertisements.
Without cookies, Shared Objects and Web Beacons, it would be difficult for us to know what areas of Preston Media have a larger audience than others and give us the needed information to increase the functionality of what we do. Tracking audience size helps us to better understand when to enhance areas of the Preston Media Network and/or create and launch new services.
Preston Media lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages or offer you products and services in connection with the Preston Media Network set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Preston Media 's cookies.
We may use a third-party ad serving technology to help us deliver ads with some of the content you view. This technology may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visit to the website where you selected the video in order to identify and display advertisements that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving these advertisements, a unique cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.
Editing and Deleting Your Account Information and Preferences
Preston Media allows you to edit your account Information, marketing and email preferences at any time. New categories of marketing communications may be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. We reserve the right to send you certain communications directly to your account relating to the Preston Media Network, such as service announcements or important administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
You can terminate and delete your Preston Media account at any time.
Security and Confidentiality With and Within Preston Media
Preston Media takes the security and confidentiality of information seriously and uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to both preserve the security and integrity of any information you transmit to Preston Media and to prevent access to personal information about you to other users and unauthorized third parties. However, this is not a guarantee, and if you chose to transmit or provide information to Preston Media you do so at your own and you are solely responsible for any losses or damages you incur as a result of any security breach.
Further, these same commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are utilized to ensure only those employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with your information (to provide products or services to you in order to do their jobs) are able to access your personal information, and then only to the extent necessary.
In the event of a security breach, Preston Media will attempt to notify you electronically, including but not limited to via email or a general Preston Media Network posting, so that you may take appropriate protective measures. Depending on the laws of your state or location, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of any security breach, or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at:
