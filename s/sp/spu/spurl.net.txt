Spurl.net 1.0 - Free online bookmarks with so much more...
Spurl.net takes great care to NOT collect or store ANY personal information about its individual users. Spurl.net does not store users real names or street addresses. Providing us with an email address is optional but not obligatory.
Users should not enter their name or other personal details into their database if they want to remain anonymous, since this data is shared with other Spurl.net users. The pages and links stored by Spurl.net users are made accessible to all other Spurl.net users through tools like hot-list, just-in, recommendations and other tools. Spurl.net users can, however, not see which user entered any particular page or link into the database.
Users can use the Tell-A-Friend button to tell their friends about Spurl.net. The button invokes the users default e-mail program with a standard invitation letter. Spurl.net does not ask for the receivers e-mail address and will NOT know where that e-mail is sent.
Spurl.net uses cookies to allow the user quick access to his data. There is no personal information in the cookie. It simply allows Spurl.net to recognise the user and save him the trouble of logging in each time he accesses his data.
Spurl.net has no plans to start collecting or storing personal information. Spurl.net may analyze trends in the aggregated database to understand the usage of its users as a whole but Spurl.net will not study the data collection trends of individual users.
If there is a change in this privacy policy, Spurl.net users will be notified in advance.
