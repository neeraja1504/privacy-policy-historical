After expiry of the applicable tax and commercial retention periods your data will be deleted.
In order to process your order, we need your name, address and payment data. We also need your email address so that we can confirm having dispatched your order with Spreadshirt. Your email address will be used as a means of identifying you with your user account.
If you do not already have a user account with Spreadshirt, you can decide on registering such a password-protected account once the order is completed. Transmitting this data makes future orders possible without having to re-enter your personal information. You can also review your previous orders as well as pending orders, and you can administer your contact data and bank data.
Shop operators / providers of ideas
We also collect, process and use your data in order to accomplish existing contract agreements with regard to operating Spreadshirt shops (including contracts with Premium Shop features) and / or your provision of ideas. Registering a Spreadshirt account is necessary to fulfil these contractual agreements. Spreadshirt sends you information in irregular intervals, particularly on changes with regard to its product range or service, advice on how to use Spreadshirt’s service as well as service reports.
Advertising and market research
Data that has been submitted to us, in particular in the process of ordering or registering customer information(signing up to newsletters via email or mail etc.) will be collected, processed and used as long as you have given your consent or statutory regulations allow for it.
You can object to the usage of your data for the purpose of advertising and market research at the address above.
Establishment of contact
Establishing contact (e.g. by filing in a contact form or via email) results in the collection, processing and usage of your data for the purpose of dealing with your request as well as future inquiries.

We also store the user’s IP address with every blog and forum contribution.
The data collected in the course of using the blog or forum is used for operating the blog and forum alone. Collecting this data is also necessary to ensure that we can take action in the case of users posting unlawful content (e.g. of insulting, politically inappropriate, propagandistic nature etc.). This is necessary so that we cannot be held liable for comments and submissions, and we need to make sure that we investigate such instances ourselves.

Our blog messages are automatically reloaded when starting the browser or the software used for this purpose, and they can be accessed through the browser bookmarks or the applicable software. Here, we only store access data and not personal data such as your operating ssytem type, Internet service provider, date and time of retrieval, name of access file and IP address.
