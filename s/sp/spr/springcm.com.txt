How Do We Protect Your Information?
SpringCM places a high value on the corporate and personal data you entrust to us.  For this reason, we secure your company data and Personal Information at three levels: physical, application, and network layers.  The physical layer is protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate operations individuals. Additionally, the servers are caged within a room only accessible through biometric scanning. The application layer is entirely secured with VeriSign’s Site Trust 128 bit SSL encryption technology so all communication with the website is locked. The network layer is protected by industry-leading firewall technology and administered real-time to ensure timely security patching. This layer is also monitored by intrusion-detection systems to ward off unauthorized access.  These safeguards are intended to protect your data and Personal Information and to ensure the proper and legal use of the Site. However, no security system is impenetrable and no one can guarantee that any information will be totally secure.
