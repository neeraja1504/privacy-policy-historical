Privacy Policy
Effective Date : 07/06/18
Springbot, Inc. (“Springbot”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We streamline the process of automating, analyzing, and personalizing an eCommerce store’s marketing campaigns through an all-in-one platform and data-driven marketing recommendations (collectively, the “Services”). In this Privacy Policy, we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about visitors (“Visitors”) to our website www.springbot.com and any related subdomains (collectively, the “Site”); users who have registered accounts with us to use our Services (“Customers”); and the end users of our Customers’ eCommerce stores or individuals that Customers may wish to market to using our Services (“End Users”). Our use of “you” refers collectively to Visitors, Customers, and End Users.
By using any of our Services, Visitors and Customers agree that their information, including personal information, will be collected, used, and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. Their use of our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. We have no direct relationship with End Users, however, so our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring that they have the appropriate permission for us to collect, use, and disclose information about End Users.
Springbot Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission.

Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We or our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about how you use our Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other information, including personal information, we collect about you.
** Cookies.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a computer’s hard drive through a web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities while using our Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers provides information about how to prevent a computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify upon receiving a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Services, but some features may not function.
** Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also referred to as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with our Services to, among other things, track user activities, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to you, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Third-Party Analytics
We may use third-party analytics companies, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us understand use of, and to improve, our Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (“LSOs”), to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please see the Google Privacy Policy; to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics, you can download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Do Not Track Disclosure
Our Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please click here. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in the Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms section above ( e.g. , by disabling cookies).
Interest-Based Advertising
We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Services, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third-party services, and to evaluate the success of advertising campaigns. You may opt out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).
Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Services or other services. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing ( i.e. , contextual advertising). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit an opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt out may no longer be effective.
Third-Party Collection
Our Services may contain links to third-party websites and applications or integrate with services provided by third parties. Any access to and use of such linked websites, applications, or third-party services is not governed by this Privacy Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.
Transfers to Third Parties. As described above, we transfer personal information from the EU to third parties. We contractually require third parties to whom we transfer personal information to provide the same level of protections as the Principles. If we transfer personal information to a third party for its own use, individuals may opt-out of this type of transfer by contacting support@springbot.com. Springbot Inc. remains responsible for the personal information we receive and transfer under Privacy Shield.
Security
We have taken steps to help protect the personal information we collect. However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your devices by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private.
Your Choices
** Updating or Deleting Personal Information.** Visitors and Customers may correct or delete the personal information that they provide to us by emailing us at support@springbot.com and describing their request to update or delete their personal information. Please note that we may retain certain information about them as required by law or as permitted by law for legitimate business purposes ( e.g. , in accordance with our record retention policies or to enforce our Terms of Use). End Users who wish to correct or delete the personal data that we use on behalf of Customers should contact the Customer with which they interact to make such a request.
** Opting out of Email Communications.** We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to Visitors and Customers. Visitors and Customers may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email or contacting us at the Contact Us information below. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If Visitors or Customers opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may still send them non-promotional emails ( e.g. , about their account with us). If you are an End User that receives emails from one of our Customers and you no longer want to be contacted by that Customer, please unsubscribe directly from that Customer’s communication or contact the Customer directly to update your email preferences.
