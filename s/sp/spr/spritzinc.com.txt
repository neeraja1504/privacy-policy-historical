We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.
• Using cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how the Services are used and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services and on third party sites or services. We may also use cookies in online advertising to track responses to our advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites. Because of the nature of our implementation of the Services, we do not honor browser “do not track” signals. You may opt out of targeted advertising as set forth below under Choices and Access.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.

We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.
