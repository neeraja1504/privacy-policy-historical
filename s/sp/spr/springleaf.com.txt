"Site" means and includes any and all websites maintained by any of the Springleaf Financial Services family of companies, which includes Springleaf Finance, Inc. and all its subsidiaries and affiliates. The terms "we," "us," "our," or "Site Sponsor," as used on this Site, mean and include any all of the Springleaf Financial Services family of companies.

E-mail address and content
Domain name and IP address (e.g., aol.com) used to access the Internet
Internet address from which the visitor linked to the Site (e.g., www.yahoo.com)
Type of web browsing software used to view the Site
Date, time, and length of visit to the Site
What about Cookies and Web Beacons? Cookies are small files containing alphanumeric characters that are used to identify your computer’s browser. Site Sponsor may send one or more Cookies to your computer to monitor your experience on the Site, and to allow us to improve the Site to better serve our customers and other users. Cookies may also be used to improve the security of the Site. No personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or social security number, is embedded in these Cookies.
A Web Beacon is an electronic image (1x1 .gif) located within a certain web page. In some cases, Site Sponsor may use a Web Beacon to analyze traffic and transactions on this Site. No personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or social security number, is collected by any Site Sponsor Web Beacon.
In cases where you may enter the Site from a third party site, such as a search engine or referral site, those sites may use Cookies and/or Web Beacons to monitor their own performance, traffic, etc. You must consult the privacy policy of each site, particularly at any sites provided by third parties, in order to determine what information about you is collected and how that information is used.
Third party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on the internet. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads on a user’s prior visits to our Site. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
Your browser should allow you to manage Cookies, and it may allow you to manage Web Beacons, used by various websites. However, if your browser’s settings are too restrictive you may not be able to use all of the features of a website, including this Site.
Can I confirm that the information Site Sponsor collects is correct?
Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If you ever have questions or issues with the accuracy of your nonpublic personal information, please contact us at the following phone number or write us at the following address:
1-800-453-2017, Springleaf Finance, P.O. Box 3662, Evansville, IN 47735-3662. We will promptly investigate your concerns and update our records as needed.
We request that you keep your information as up to date as possible so that you may get the maximum benefit from Site Sponsor. In particular, please make sure that you inform us of e-mail address changes since this is the most rapid way to communicate.
How is information collected on this Site protected?
Site Sponsor uses multiple levels of security regardless of the delivery channel you choose. We maintain personally identifying information in secure computer systems and we limit employee access to those with a business reason to see it. More specifically, employees may access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs. We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures. Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.
Site Sponsor is protected by a system of filtering routers and firewalls, which form a barrier between the outside Internet and the internal network. The filtering router verifies the source and destination of each network packet, and determines whether or not to let the packet through. Access is denied if the packet is not directed at a specific, available service.
The firewall is used to shield Site Sponsor’s client service network from the Internet. All incoming IP traffic is actually addressed to the firewall, which is designed to allow only e-mail into the client service environment. Traffic through the firewall is subjected to a special proxy process which operates in much the same way as a filtering router, verifying the source and destination of each information packet.
The proxy then changes the IP address of the packet to deliver it to the appropriate site within the client service network. In this way, all inside addresses are protected from outside access, and the structure of Site Sponsor’s internal networks is invisible to outside observers.
Am I protected when linking to other sites?
This Site may, from time to time, contain links to other Internet websites, banner ads or advertisements for the convenience of users in locating information and services that may be of interest. If you use those linked Internet websites or advertisements, you may leave this Site and go to websites that we do not control. If you decide to visit those Internet sites or advertisers, you do so at your own risk and it is your responsibility to read and comply with the privacy statement on those websites. Your right to privacy on linked sites is limited to whatever rights are provided to you by the owner of the linked site.
This Website Privacy Policy is for customers and visitors, and only applies to this Site. This Site only includes its home page and pages hereunder operated by Site Sponsor. This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to any linked site or any site provided by a third party. You must consult the privacy policy of such sites, in order to determine what information about you is collected and how that information is used.
Online Tracking
Site Sponsor does not track its customers over time and across third party websites in order to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve your content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, most popular browsers (Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.) allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. You should consult each site’s privacy policy to determine how that site’s operator responds to DNT signals
Third parties that have content embedded on Site Sponsor's websites may set cookies on a user's browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Site Sponsor website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Site Sponsor's websites unless you provide it to them directly.
Do We Collect Information about Children?
We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from our Site about children under the age 13. We request that persons under the age of 18 not use our Site without supervision from a responsible adult. If a child whom we know to be under the age of 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents, or seek parental consent.
What About Transfer of Information to the United States?
Our Site is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including personal information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Site or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including personal information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
What About Changes to the Privacy Policy?
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of our Site indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not use your previously collected personal information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.

We may collect this information through various forms and in various places in the Program, including if you sign-up for our Program’s online account management function as required in order to enter the Program or when you otherwise interact with the Program. If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you in connection with the Program, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

Interactions with Third-Party Services The Program may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Program and a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, after you sign-up for our online account management function as required in order to enter the Program, you may have an option to link your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Foursquare or other account provided by a third-party site, platform or application to your Program account so that you may participate in certain types of Program point earning activities that we may offer from time to time.

We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.

You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Program.

If so, the information you provide (names, email addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Program, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).
