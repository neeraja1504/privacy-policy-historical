Cookie Use Notice:
The Spreety Website employs "cookies" to provide better service to its customers. Spreety does not use cookies to collect any personally identifying information from users or to track user activities beyond our web site. Spreety does not maintain copies of cookies on our servers after you leave our web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are exchanged between a web site and a user's computer which enable a "session", or "dialog", to be established between the two machines. With the session established, Spreety is able to tailor its responses (i.e., identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The session is often broken when Spreety does not receive further requests from your computer or you simply exit your browser. Spreety does not use "session cookies", which are types of cookies that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Session cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the computer or the user exits the browser. Spreety does issue "persistent cookies", types of cookies that could be stored permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Spreety web site. Those cookies may be stored on some user's computers and, in some cases, may be updated by the user's browser when revisiting the Spreety web site. In the event a cookie is found on your workstation, which was issued from a Spreety web site, you may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our web site.
