to provide law enforcement agencies with the information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber attack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore statistically evaluated by Spryker Systems GmbH and with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our company with the end goal of ensuring an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.

Such cookies are not only set by Spryker itself, but also on its behalf by third parties such as Google (see below) or Facebook. In order to do this, these third-party companies place cookies which record usage data on the user’s computer on behalf of Spryker.

More information on deleting or disabling cookies can be found in the help texts of the browsers used or on the Internet, for example, under the search words “Deactivate cookies” or “Delete cookies” (deletion instructions in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Deletion instructions in Mozilla Firefox. Deletion instructions in Safari). If the user decides to disable cookies, this can reduce the scope of the service and have a negative impact on the use of Spryker services.

Cookies, which are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process, are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.

V. Data Protection for Applications and in Application Procedures
Spryker Systems GmbH collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. Processing may also be carried out electronically.

If Spryker Systems GmbH does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted six months after communication of the rejection decision, provided that there are no other legitimate interests of Spryker Systems GmbH to the contrary. Other legitimate interests in this sense are, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).

XIII. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google Analytics (with Anonymization Function)
Spryker Systems GmbH has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on its website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the surveying, collation and evaluation of data regarding the behavior of visitors to internet sites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website a user came from (a “referrer”), which subpages of the website were accessed, or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
Spryker Systems GmbH uses the suffix “_gat._anonymizeIp” for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, Google shortens and anonymizes the IP address of the user’s internet connection if our internet pages are accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Among other things, Google uses the data and information obtained to evaluate the use of our internet sites, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our internet sites, and to provide other services in connection with the use of our internet sites.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the user’s information technology system. What cookies are has already been explained above. By placing the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Every time one of the individual pages of this website–which is operated by Spryker Systems GmbH and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated–is visited, the internet browser on the user’s information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the user, which Google uses, among other things, to trace the origin and clicks of the user and subsequently enable commission statements.
Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access originated, and the frequency of visits to our internet sites by the user. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the user, is transmitted to Google in the U.S.A.. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.
The user can prevent the storing of cookies through our internet sites as already described above, at any time through a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and thus permanently object to the storing of cookies. The use of such an internet browser setting would also prevent Google from placing a cookie on the user’s information technology system. In addition, a cookie already placed by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, the user has the option to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent this from happening. To do this, the user must download and install a browser add-on from the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information on visits to internet sites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered an objection by Google. If the user’s information technology system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later time, the user must reinstall the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the user or another person within their control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.
We have concluded a data processing contract with Google based on the so-called EU standard contract clauses. More information and Google’s current data protection conditions can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/and at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in more detail at this linkhttps://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/.
XIV. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google Maps
This website uses the map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
To use the functions of Google Maps it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this website has no influence on this data transmission.
The use of Google Maps is in the interest of creating an appealing representation of our online offers and to ensure that the places indicated by us on the website are easy to find. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.
You can find more information on the handling of user data in Google’s data protection policy: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/
XV. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google AdWords
Spryker Systems GmbH has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads in both Google’s search engine results and the Google Advertising Network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define certain keywords to display an ad in Google’s search engine results only when the user uses the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, ads are distributed on topical websites using an automated algorithm and according to pre-defined keywords.
The operating company for the Google AdWords service is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
The purpose of Google AdWords is to promote our website by displaying interest-based advertising on third-party websites and in the search engine results of Google’s search engine and by displaying advertisements on our website.
If a user reaches our website via a Google ad, a so-called conversion cookie will be stored on the user’s information technology system by Google. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the user. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been called up on our website. The conversion cookie enables both us and Google to track whether a user who has accessed our website via an AdWords ad has generated revenue, that is, completed or canceled a purchase of goods.
The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to generate visit statistics for our website. We use these visit statistics to determine the total number of users who have been referred to us via AdWords ads, that is, to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the person concerned.
The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the person concerned. Personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is therefore transferred to Google in the United States of America each time she visits our Internet pages. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.
The person concerned can prevent the storing of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, through an appropriate setting on the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the storing of cookies. Use of such an internet browser setting would also prevent Google from storing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, the person concerned has the option to object to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must access the link http://www.google.de/settings/ads from each of the Internet browsers they use and adjust the required settings there.
We have concluded a data processing contract with Google based on the so-called EU standard contract clauses. More information and the applicable data protection regulations from Google can be obtained at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.

If you click the LinkedIn button (plugin), you will be redirected to our LinkedIn offer in a separate browser window, and if you are logged into your LinkedIn user account you can follow us at LinkedIn. The plug-in establishes a direct connection between your browser and the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn receives the information that you have visited our website with your IP address. In addition, LinkedIn will then be able to associate your visit to our website with you and your user account, provided you are logged into your LinkedIn user account. We point out that we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted (personal) data and its use by LinkedIn. For more information, please see LinkedIn’s data protection policy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.
XXI. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of YouTube
Our website uses plugins from Google’s YouTube site. The website is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
If you visit one of our websites equipped with a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our websites you have visited.
If you’re logged into your YouTube account, YouTube will allow you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
The use of YouTube is in the interest of creating an attractive presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.
For more information on how user data is handled, please see YouTube’s privacy policy: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
XXII. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of WhatsApp Broadcast
To provide the WhatsApp broadcast service, we use the services of WhatsBroadcast GmbH, Schwanthalerstrasse 32, 80336 Munich. If you visit one of our pages that is equipped with a WhatsApp plugin, a connection to the servers of WhatsBroadcast GmbH is established. This tells the WhatsBroadcast GmbH server which of our websites you have visited.  If you subscribe to a newsletter service via your Messenger, your phone number will be stored on the WhatsBroadcast GmbH servers. The data can be deleted at any time by sending the text “DELETE ALL DATA” via your Messenger.
More information on the handling of user data can be found in WhatsBroadcast GmbH’s data protection policy: https://www.whatsbroadcast.com/de/datenschutz/
