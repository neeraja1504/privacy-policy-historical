ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS
We allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and online services, including your IP address, device identifiers, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Sumo Logic and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. If you are in the EU, please visit www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
Various browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Sumo Logic should interpret DNT signals. Therefore, Sumo Logic does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.

Privacy Shield Notice
References to “we” or “us” in the following paragraph refer only to Sumo Logic Inc. We adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “ Principles ”) in connection with our transfer of personal data to the United States that relates to individuals in the EEA, UK and Switzerland (“ Covered Data ”). For more information about the Principles and to view our certification, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at www.privacyshield.gov. You may contact us about any question or complaint regarding our adherence to the Principles as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section above.

Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share Covered Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that party’s processing of Covered Data in violation of the Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
