To protect our members' privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentialityprotections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell the information we provide to other third parties.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT FORMER MEMBERS
If you terminate your membership with Summit Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.
OPT OUT REQUEST
You may request that we not share personal information with certain non-affiliated third parties. However, your request does not apply to anything that is sent directly from Summit Credit Union, disclosures that are legally required or that are required to perform a service you've requested, or to relationships with affiliated third parties. Please note that while at this time, we have not established any relationship that this opt-out will apply toward, there may be an opportunity in the future that we feel is beneficial for you. An example would be specific benefits for Summit Credit Union members with travel clubs or retail stores.
JOINT/MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS
If you have a joint account, your opt out applies to every person on the account.
If you have multiple accounts with us, you must opt out separately for each account. If you still choose to exercise an opt-out request, call (800) 236-5560, or visit our Website at SummitCreditUnion.com and click on "About Summit" then "Privacy Policy." Once we receive your request, we have a reasonable amount of time to stop the disclosures. You can contact the credit union any time to revoke your opt-out election. If you would like clarification of these conditions, please call or visit our website at SummitCreditUnion.com for a list of "Frequently Asked Questions."
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, or procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.
WHAT MEMBERS CAN DO TO HELP
Summit Credit Union is committed to protecting the privacy of its members. Members can help by following these simple guidelines:
Protect your account numbers, plastic card numbers, personal identification numbers (PINs) or passwords. Never keep your PIN with your card. The PIN can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.
Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you explaining the call is on behalf of the credit union and asks for your account number, you should beware. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
Keep your information with us current. If your address or phone number changes, please let us know. It is important that we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately.
Let us know if you have questions. Please do not hesitate to call us -- we are here to serve you!
