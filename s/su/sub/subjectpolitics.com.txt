DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, because of the uncertainty of DNT in the internet industry, and the various factors and players conforming compliance, we may not recognize nor respond to DNT signals.
VIII. Accessing and Correcting Your Information.
If you choose to close your account or terminate your relationship with the Services, including by unsubscribing from the newsletter, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy above, retention of that information will be subject to those companies’ policies, typically found on their websites.
IX. Deactivation; Termination of Your Account.
(A) When your account is deactivated or terminated, for any or no reason as may be determined by the Terms of Use, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the Website. We are not responsible for any information, pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your account.
(B) To prevent abuse of the Website by a user following termination or deletion of an account, we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that the user does not open a new account or profile in violation of our Terms of Use or other restrictions, and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.
(C) After you remove information from your profile, if you created one, or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted subject to their respective terms of service or privacy policies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies owned by the Company for up to 30 days to enable restoration or reactivation subject to successful appeal to Company, but will not be available to other users in the meantime.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
