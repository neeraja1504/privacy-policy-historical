Use of traffic data
Each time a visitor comes to a SubmitEdge Web site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. At SubmitEdge content sites, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or yale.edu), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a SubmitEdge Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). The SubmitEdge site collects visitor information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement and targeted advertising. We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the SubmitEdge properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but SubmitEdge will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When SubmitEdge does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
Use of cookies
SubmitEdge Web sites may use cookies for internal reporting. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system. Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that SubmitEdge does not control.

After a subscriber signs up on one of our sign up forms a confirmation email will be sent to the subscriber. The subscriber will only be added to our database when they confirm their subscription by replying to this email.
On SubmitEdge Web sites that offer newsletters, we collect subscribers' email addresses in order to distribute those newsletters and product-related announcements. In addition, SubmitEdge has entered into agreements with a number of other companies to distribute SubmitEdge newsletters and mailing lists to users on their systems.
