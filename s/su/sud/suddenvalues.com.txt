Personal information is collected to allow subscribers and merchant customers ("Users") to create accounts, buy vouchers, receive updates and participate in services. Additionally, we use this information to better understand Users needs. Of this Personal information, demographic information is only in aggregate form. Non-Personal information is collected to measure our success and better understand the desires of our Users. SuddenValues is the sole owner of information collected on this site, including those that participate in our services that may have joined at merchant's physical location or website. Our merchant customers are the sole owners of information collected on their sites and at their physical locations.

Visitors to our network of websites and participating merchant locations are offered the opportunity to register for promotional and informational email campaigns that are sent directly from SuddenValues.com and/or its participating merchant customers. In registration, users are required to provide contact information such as name and email address to receive these email campaigns, but may opt-out of future email campaigns at any time.

Your Personal information will never be sold, shared, rented or otherwise distributed to third parties for promotional use, beyond those Users that elect to become one of our merchant's customers, affiliates that need data to perform the services and/or as required by law. Personal information is only disclosed in a limited set of circumstances: (1) to allow our Dealers and merchant customers to perform their duties in providing the services in their community, (2) to enable contracted third parties to assist in their support of services and (3) as required by law or regulating authorities. To the extent legally possible, we require each to maintain this information in confidence.
