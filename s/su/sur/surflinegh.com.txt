**INFORMATION COLLECTED  **
In the course of operating the SURFLINE Services, we may collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, birth date and gender and/or your company contact information. Personal Information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a SURFLINE Service you choose to subscribe to, when you enter a SURFLINE promotion or choose to receive a SURFLINE newsletter. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information. We will use this information to reply to your inquiries, to provide you with requested products and services, to set up your member's account, and to contact you regarding new products and services.
Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, email address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.
"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain you may have used to access a SURFLINE Service, the type and version of browser or operating system you may be using, and the website you may have come from and visit next. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a SURFLINE Service, is also considered Non-Personal Information.
SURFLINE derives or collects and uses Non-Personal Information in the course of operating the SURFLINE Services. For example, our Web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie or through a Web Beacon when you choose to visit a SURFLINE Service.
