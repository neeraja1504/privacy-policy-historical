_ Disclosure
Survivalistboards.com contains advertising and some contextual affiliate marketing links, meaning we may get commission on sales of those products or services mentioned...The content of posts on this forum are never influenced by advertisers or an affiliate partnership, nor are posts written for the sole purpose of promoting a product. _ FTC Required Disclosure
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) now requires bloggers to disclose their relationship with companies, and individuals selling products. Whether the blogger received a payment for the product, whether the results are going to be typical,,,, just all kinds of stuff.
Since I’am not a lawyer, this is my attempt at such a disclosure.
I (Kevin) do not receive payments of any kind to review a product, if I did receive a payment it would be disclosed on a per-review basis.
Sometimes people will send me products to review. This does not influence my opinion of the product in anyway.
When I review a product – it needs to be noted that my results and opinion might differ from other peoples. Difference in manufacturing standards, quality control, and other factors out of my control might have an impact on the final product. Just because I have a product of a certain quality, does not mean that yours will be “exactly” the same.
