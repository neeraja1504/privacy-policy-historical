Why this Privacy Policy?
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) aims to inform you about how we use personal data collected via the Site. Please read this Privacy Policy before using the Site or submitting any personal data. This Privacy Policy supplements the SURVEY ANYPLACE Terms (and uses terms defined therein), and is a part of the agreement between SURVEY ANYPLACE and its Users.
Every person who visits the Site and/or registers (hereafter the “User” or “you”) discloses a certain amount of personal data. The personal data is information which allows SURVEY ANYPLACE to identify you as a natural person, regardless of whether we actually do this. You are identifiable as soon as it is possible to create a direct or indirect link between one or more data and you as a natural person.
SURVEY ANYPLACE is committed to the protection of the privacy of its Users, regardless of whether they are situated inside or outside the European Economic Area. We only use and process your personal data in accordance with the GDPR. The GDPR is short for the Regulation (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation). This European regulation provides the highest level of privacy protection in the world. That is why we apply this high standard to all Users.
Through this Privacy Policy, every User of the Site is informed of the processing activities SURVEY ANYPLACE may carry out with his or her personal data. SURVEY ANYPLACE reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at all times. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the new version of the Privacy Policy on the Site or may send each User a courtesy email. It is your responsibility to check the Site for updates to this Privacy Policy.
Links to other websites
Our Site may contain or provide hyperlinks or pointed to other websites and/or electronic communication portals maintained by third parties or may provide third party content on our Site by framing or other methods. Such a reference being made on our Site does not mean that there is any connection between our Site and these third-party websites nor that we (implicitly) agree with the content on those sites.
We do not guarantee or assume any liability for the accuracy, legality, completeness or quality of the content of third-party websites linked to on our Site or of other electronic communications portals that are not under our actual control. These references are therefore to click at your own risk and responsibility. We are not liable for any damage resulting therefrom.
These external websites may not offer the same guarantees as we do. If you click on a link on this Site that leads to a foreign website and leaves your personal data on such a website, the processing of that personal data is not subject to this privacy policy, but to the privacy policy, if any, of the operator of that third-party website. We therefore recommend you to carefully read the terms and conditions and privacy statement of these other websites.
Who is responsible for the processing of personal data?
Controller
SURVEY ANYPLACE is responsible for the processing of the personal data of the Users. SURVEY ANYPLACE decides alone or in cooperation with others which personal data are being collected as well as the purposes and the technical and organisational means with regard to the processing of those personal data.
SURVEY ANYPLACE has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data of its Users. SURVEY ANYPLACE uses a variety of adequate security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. SURVEY ANYPLACE secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When financial information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to the payment gateway, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
However, the User acknowledges that he acts in the capacity of data controller with regard to any personal data he uses or submits in or through a survey or other application or functionality of the Site, since the User decides alone which personal data of respondents are being collected, without interference from or control by SURVEY ANYPLACE. In this context, the User understands that SURVEY ANYPLACE acts as a mere processor. In that regard, User commits to communicate to its respondents that it relies on the services of an external processor who applies the same level of privacy standards as the User. In addition, we advise all Users to act in accordance with the GDPR by sufficiently informing all respondents of the purposes for which their personal data are collected and by obtaining the necessary consents.
Processor(s)
SURVEY ANYPLACE is free to rely on data processors. A processor is the natural or legal person who processes the personal data of the Users upon request and on behalf of the data controller. The processor is required to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data. The processor shall always act on the instructions of the data controller.
SURVEY ANYPLACE relies on the following categories of “processors”:
Companies we have engaged for hosting purposes (e.g. Amazon AWS);
Companies we have engaged for communication purposes (e.g. Intercom, MailChimp);
Companies we have engaged for administrative and billing purposes (e.g. Recurly, Freshbooks);
With a view to the optimal protection of the personal data of the Users, SURVEY ANYPLACE has made the necessary contractual arrangements with the aforementioned data processors to ensure that they apply the same standards as SURVEY ANYPLACE.
