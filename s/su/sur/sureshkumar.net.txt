Information Collection
Log files

The server stores your host, your operating system, your browser, and referring page in the servers log file when you access Sureshkumar.net. This information is stored, by default, by most websites. We do not use this information to track individual users; these log files are analyzed by statistical packages to determine trends in visitor patterns, such as which pages are most popular and which referrers send the most visitors. Your host name is used only to determine statistics about the siteâ€™s percentages of traffic from various countries.
**
DISCUSSIONS BOARD
**
You are asked but not required to register when you use the Discussions board. You are not required to give your personal information when signing up and creating a profile. We do not use the information in visitor profiles for any purpose. The Discussion board also tracks IP addresses of visitors. We do not use this information to track individuals, except in cases of visitors spamming the Discussions board. If you register to use the Discussion board, you will be asked for an email address; we do not, and do not intend to, sell your email address to spam houses.

Information Usage
**
We do not track individual users on the site, except in extreme cases to respond to persistent attacks on the system, such as when a user spams the Discussions board or hacks the site. We use the information obtained from the server logs to improve the layout of the site and to make educated guesses as to what could be improved.
