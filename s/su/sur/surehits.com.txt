SureHits Privacy Policy
Internet consumer privacy is of paramount importance to SureHits and our advertisers. The following statement outlines our policies and principles regarding online privacy. SureHits is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers and to do our part to maintain the integrity and security of the Internet. Because of the changing nature of consumer needs and our business itself, SureHits reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time without notice. As such, and since we want to always make certain that our privacy policy is clearly understood, we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically to note any changes that may have occurred. Please forward any comments you may have regarding this policy to us at  service@SureHits.com.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of Cyberspace Communication Corp.'s placed advertisements, Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding the consumer who clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address).
In the course of providing the user a shopping experience, personally identifiable information may be provided to Cyberspace Communications Corp. This information will be temporarily stored for a reasonable length of time for the purposes of fulfilling the shopping experience. The personally identifiable information supplied by the user will not be permanently stored or archived.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of Cyberspace Communication Corp.'s placed advertisements, Cyberspace Communication Corp. collects what the industry terms as "ad delivery and reporting data" (Type of Browser, Operating System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement). This type of information is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network Advertising Initiative section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) "ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes.
Cyberspace Communication Corp. retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for accounting and auditing purposes.
In addition Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not collect any specific non-personally identifiable information (e.g. age, gender, interests, income-range) that could potentially be linked with other data to identify individual Internet consumers for the purpose of profiling.
Cookies
When an Internet consumer views a Cyberspace Communication Corp. served advertisement for the first time, a cookie is placed within their computer. A cookie is a unique tag that is issued to the Internet customer and is used to identify individual computers. The purpose of the cookie is to allow the ad placement company to deliver advertisements that have a greater degree of relevance to the consumer, even though that consumer is, in essence, anonymous to the ad placement company. Consumers who wish to remove this cookie and disable their web browser from receiving further cookies can do so by following the instructions provided by their browser's manufacturer.
Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies
When a consumer clicks on an ad placed by Cyberspace Communication Corp., they are assigned a unique number, known as a cookie, which is recorded and stored on their computer in their web browser's cookie file. Cookies do not harm Internet consumer's computers.
Cookies help us to reach several of our key goals, such as providing Internet users with a more fulfilling, results oriented experience on the web, and increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by Internet consumers.
Non-Personally Identifiable Client Data
Cyberspace Communication Corp. sometimes collects non-personally identifiable information from our clients. Non-personally identifiable information is also known as "demographic" data and includes information such as age, gender, geographic location. We use this information to refer consumers to appropriate partners.

Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not use any personally identifiable data about a client for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable information that Cyberspace Communication Corp. collects from clients is principally intended for administrative needs (e.g., accounting), for which purpose such data are required.
