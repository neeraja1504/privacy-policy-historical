1. Demographic Data
Through the use of certain technologies we are able to track and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site. The Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including IP addresses, cookie information, browsing history and the Site pages requested. The Company only uses this data in aggregate form, for statistical purposes, and not in a manner that would give the Company sufficient information to identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users access parts of the Site, what types of Content they are interested in, where they are generally located and what are their general online behavior patterns. We utilize this information so that we can improve the Site and the Content. This information may be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregated basis, but it does not include the Personal Data of individual users. Our use of cookies, pixel tags and IP Addresses are set forth accordingly:
(a) Cookies are small bits of information that that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered users, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences. The Company uses cookies for improving the Site usability and aggregating non-identifiable behavioral information for both internal purposes and for sharing with our advertisers. Our cookies do not collect or contain Personal Data, but may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to the registration data you have submitted to us, e.g. your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices. While you may also turn off your computer’s acceptance of cookies through your browser, your full use of the Site may be restricted.
(b) Pixel Tags , also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of the Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. The Company uses pixel tags for Site analytics, site crawling across the Company’s network of sites and to serve you more relevant Content and ads based upon your historical behavioral patterns. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous Site visit.
(c) We collect your computer’s IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, to conduct Site analysis, block computers who have violated our Terms of Service, and identify computers which may be engaged in illegal or illicit activity on our Site . While we do not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Data, we will use IP addresses to identify any user who refuses to comply with these Terms and Conditions or otherwise violates any applicable laws. Additionally, we may be required to disclose IP addresses pursuant to a court order or subpoena.
(d) The Company shares Demographic Data and non-identifiable (e.g. hashed) Personal Data to third party advertisers and data brokers so that they can determine user preferences based upon online behavioral patterns and can serve contextual advertising while users are visiting the Site to enhance the user experience with more relevant advertisements. Users may opt out of these services as prescribed in Section 6 below.
2. Personal Data
If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of the Company and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

(ii) Forums, Blogs and Thread Discussions. Users may participate in forums, blogs and thread discussions with other users on the Site. While the Company does not actively mine for its users’ Personal Data disseminated in such blogs, threads and forums, the Company will be storing the content as User Generated Content and therefore collect such information indirectly. Although the Company does not monitor the exchange of Personal Data that users disclose to such other users in forums, blogs and group discussions, such data may be mined by third parties including other users and the Company’s advertisers as such data is considered publically accessible. Further, while the Company does not give advertisers direct access to Personal Data except as otherwise may be provided under Section 5 of this Privacy Policy, the Company’s advertisers may be able to derive a user’s identity from such public postings and link it to their Personal Data.
THE COMPANY STRONGLY ADVISES AGAINST USERS USING THEIR REAL NAMES AS THEIR “USER NAME” ON THE SITE, PARTICULARLY IF ENGAGED IN FORUMS, GROUP OR BLOG DISCUSSIONS WITH ANYONE THE USER DOES NOT KNOW. WHILE THE COMPANY ENCOURAGES THE FORUMS TO BE SELF-POLICING, SUCH POSTINGS WILL BE SEARCHABLE BY MAJOR SEARCH ENGINES AND THUS THE COMPANY CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR POTENTIALLY DAMAGING INFORMATION OR POSTINGS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR TRUE IDENTITY. FURTHER, AS THE COMPANY DOES NOT SCREEN THE BACKGROUNDS OF OUR USERS, IT CANNOT GUARANTEE A USER’S PERSONAL SAFETY OR PREDATORY CONDUCT BY OTHER USERS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY STRONGLY URGES ITS USERS NOT TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL DATA WITH ANY OTHER USER UNLESS A USER KNOWS THEM PERSONALLY, AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY RELATED THERETO.
(iii) Method of Contacting Users. The Company may use Personal Data collected from its users to contact them or share the Personal Data with its advertisers who may also contact them. Typically, the user would be contacted by Company (or any other party authorized under Section 5 below) through email or pop-up windows on their browser. In some cases, such as to verify the identity of a registration, a user may be required to authenticate their registration through SMS. The user may only opt out of certain categories of contact as set forth in Section 5 and 6 of this Privacy Policy.
(iv) Modifying Personal Data. Users may modify or update their Personal Data after registration to ensure it is accurate by logging into their accounts and editing their user profile. Users may also modify their Personal Data sharing preferences under Section 5 below.
(v) Use of Personal Data. The Company uses Personal Data that its users provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Specifically, the Company will use Personal Data to the extent necessary to provide the products and services offered on this Site, to register user profiles (including authentication), to maintain user account, to administer the Site, to facilitate user’s online transactions on the Site, including e-commerce transactions, to monitor violations of the Terms and Conditions (and take appropriate actions as prescribed in the Terms and Conditions) and as may be otherwise permissible under applicable law. The Company may also use user Personal Data to offer them certain products and services users may find of interest and share such information with third parties as prescribed in Section 5 below. Users may, however, opt out of receiving future solicitations by following the instructions in such email or by communicating the user’s opt out preferences in its profile as explained in Section 5 below.
If the Company intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, users will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected and will be given an opportunity to opt out of such use. In a case where such proposed usage is necessary to provide enhanced services on the Site, a user’s opt out to such usage may restrict the user’s use of all or a portion of the Site.
3. Storage and Data Retention
“Active Data” means Personal Data and Demographic Data associated with the Site where the Site (a) admin has accessed such Site within the prior 30 day period and (b) has at least one (1) post within the previous 90-day period. Crowdgather collects and retains “Active Data” indefinitely. “Old Data” is any data which is not Active Data. Old Data may also include data collected from the Site prior to the Site being permanently disabled by the Company. The Company generally archives Old Data for a period of up to 30 days or sooner before deleting it from its servers.
4. Security
The Company employs reasonable security measures in place to protect against the theft, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under its control. All Personal Data is housed in a secured internal infrastructure. The Company utilizes the current standard industry practices to maintain security of Personal Data. However, no Internet, mobile or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail or SMS message sent or uploaded User Generated Content sent to or from this Site may not be secure. Therefore, users should therefore take special care in deciding what information they send to the Company through an Internet connection or mobile network.
Personal Data contained in a user profile may only be accessible through a valid username and password. Users are responsible to maintain their user name and password and to not share these with anyone else. The Company is not responsible for any breaches of a user’s profile and access to their Personal Data which is attributed to lost or stolen user names and passwords. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure of a user’s user name and password, users are advised to change their password as soon as they become aware of such disclosure.

The Company considers its users’ Personal Data to be a vital part of their relationship. In most cases, the Company will not share your Personal Data without your prior informed consent, and you may opt out of the Company’s sharing of certain Personal Data to certain third parties as described in this Section 5. There are however, certain circumstances in which the Company may share a user’s Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice or required consent of users.
