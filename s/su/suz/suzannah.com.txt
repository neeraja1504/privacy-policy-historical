Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

Both Suzannah.com and our marketing partners may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities.
When we offer contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive e-mail messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions when you register for the above. In this case, however, we may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations.
In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Suzannah.com / Dress-Boutique.com Ltd will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

What are cookies? How does Suzannah.com / Dress-Boutique.com use cookies on its site?
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computers hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you’ve visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.
We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site.
Through our use of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.
Is my information secure?
Protecting your credit card and order information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.
SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which means it is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our websites servers.
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at Suzannah.com / Dress-Boutique.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.”
If your browser or firewall does not support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you wont be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.
