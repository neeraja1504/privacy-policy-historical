We use the personal information collected from you for a number of purposes, where we have a lawful reason, including:

We will never sell your personal information to any third parties.
We will share your personal information with partner organisations, such as local authorities or funders, where mentioned when you provide us with your personal information.
In order to deliver the services we offer, we may share your personal information with carefully selected third parties working with us or on our behalf, for example delivery companies for our online shop.
We will share your personal information when legally required to do so.
How do we keep your personal information secure?
We adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to make sure your personal information is secure, and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and accidental loss, destruction or damage, from the point of collection to the point of destruction.
Access to your personal information is restricted to those people who are required and authorised to process it. Appropriate background checks and training take place for our staff, contractors and volunteers processing personal information.
Your personal information will only be shared with another organisation if they agree to ensure sufficient safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.
We will not transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area unless appropriate safeguards are in place, your individual rights are enforceable with effective legal remedies and you are informed.
How long do we keep your personal information?
While you are actively engaged with our work we will retain your personal information. Beyond that, we will generally keep your personal information for up to six years, or as legally required. We will remove your personal information earlier if it is no longer required, we no longer have a lawful basis for processing it, or you ask us to remove it.
