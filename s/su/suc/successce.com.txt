We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website offerings in order to service you better.
Sharing of Information
In order for us to service your requests, process your applications and conduct business from day-to-day, we must occasionally share your Personal Information with other companies.  These companies may include, but are not limited to, state departments of Insurance, regulatory and designation granting authorities, as well as affiliated Continuing Education providers.  We reserve the right to share this Personal Information in accordance with the terms of HIPAA, the GLB Act, for California State residents only, the CFPA and, for Vermont State residents only, the VFCRA.  For purposes of compliance with the GLB Act, CFPA and VFCRA, Success Continuing Education (SCE) will not share “non-public personal information” with its affiliates or non-affiliates without providing customers with an annual “Privacy Notice” explaining that Success Continuing Education (SCE) will be sharing this non-public personal information with affiliates or non-affiliates of Success Continuing Education (SCE) and, for purposes of the GLB Act, providing customers with the opportunity to opt-out from such disclosures.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the non-public personal information of California State residents shall not be shared by Success Continuing Education (SCE) with third-parties unless: (1) Success Continuing Education (SCE) has obtained a fully executed consent acknowledgement from the applicable California resident; or (2) the California resident already has a relationship with a non-affiliated financial institution pursuant to, and as defined under, the CFPA.  To fully execute a CFPA consent acknowledgement, please send an email to info@successce.com.  For purposes of compliance with the VFCRA, Success Continuing Education (SCE) will not share “non-public personal financial information” (as defined in the VFCRA) with third-parties without providing Vermont State residents with an annual notice explaining that Success Continuing Education (SCE) will be sharing this non-public personal information with non-affiliated third-parties.

We use the Personal Information that you supply to personalize your experience with the Website, to evaluate whether you are qualified for the Service and for verification purposes.  The Personal Information that you submit to Success Continuing Education (SCE) remains your property, but by submitting that Personal Information to Success Continuing Education (SCE), you grant Success Continuing Education (SCE) the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use that Personal Information for marketing purposes.  By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you authorize Success Continuing Education (SCE) to use your Personal Information to obtain other information about you from third-parties where such information was either not requested on the applicable registration form, or where such registration form was incompletely or improperly filled out.  Such third-parties include, but are not limited to, state departments of insurance (DOIS), regulatory and designation authorities, FINRA, and other outside parties as permitted or required by applicable laws.  Any and all Sensitive Information that we collect as part of your Service application, and from third-parties, will be used to determine your eligibility for the Service only and will not be shared with third-parties other than who are involved in the processing of certificates, posting CE hours, courses, and credits earned, broker/dealers, general agencies and product distribution companies, as applicable, for purposes of evaluating your qualifications.  If you choose to provide information such as your Social Security Number, or authorize us to obtain your Social Security Number on your behalf, we may use that information for any other lawful purposes.  If you do not provide such information, we may also use other information that you provided for the purpose of verifying your eligibility for continuing education credits or for any other programs, offers or services applied for by and through the Website.
Subject to restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law, we may sell Personal Information (other than: (i) Sensitive Information; (ii) where you have opted-out from the use of such information; (iii) where we have not received your authorization or met the requirements of an exception under the VFCRA, if you are a Vermont State resident; and (iv) where we have not received your acknowledgement and consent or met the requirements of an exception under the CFPA, if you are a California State resident;) and/or join together with other businesses to bring selected opportunities to our customers. Success Continuing Education (SCE) is able to offer its Service to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers.  This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.  We also use contact information from your registration data to send you information about Success Continuing Education (SCE) and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you. Please keep in mind, though, that Success Continuing Education (SCE) does not control, and is not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers.  Your contact information is also used to reach you, when necessary, regarding issues concerning your use of the Website.  If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us and/or third-party advertisers, or if you wish to prevent the transfer and/or sale of your Personal Information to third-parties (subject to restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law), please see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below.

Additionally, some third party departments of insurance, regulatory and designation authorities and others that are involved in the processing, funding and reporting of your CE information, as well as broker/dealers, general agencies, professional organizations, and marketing partners may require the transfer of some or all of the Personal Information that you supplied to Success Continuing Education (SCE).  When necessary, Success Continuing Education (SCE) provides this information to those third parties that are involved and our marketing partners (subject to restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law).  Success Continuing Education (SCE) is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party underwriters and lenders.
Third-Party Offers
Success Continuing Education (SCE) provides you with the opportunity to receive special offers, products and/or services from other third-party companies.  To receive such offers, products and/or services, certain of your Personal Information (other than the Sensitive Information) will be shared with such third-party companies (subject to restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law), so that they may provide their offer, product or service to you without requiring that you first complete another registration form.
Security
All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. When our registration/application process asks users to enter Sensitive Information (such as license numbers, Social Security Number, etc), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.  While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user Personal Information (including Sensitive Information) off-line.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information (including Sensitive Information), we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.  Access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.  All of our users’ Personal Information, not just the Sensitive Information, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Success Continuing Education (SCE) user information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.  In compliance with applicable federal and state law, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
