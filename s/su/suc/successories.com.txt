Successories - Privacy Policy
Our Policy
We recognize that many online customers are concerned about the information they must provide, and how that information will be used. We have done our best to ensure the privacy and security of your transactions with us. Your credit card number and other personal data will be treated with the highest standards of security features, safety, and confidentiality.
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please submit those questions or concerns via the Contact Us portion of this web site.
Secure Shopping
Orders placed on our site are encrypted with SSL (secure socket layers) technology. The information you send via the Internet can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered. In order for SSL security to work, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. Supported browsers include Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
Note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. Please keep in mind this is NOT the means by which your credit card information is sent via the online ordering process of this web site. If you are still concerned about ordering electronically, you can place your order by phone, fax or mail.
Online Privacy
Successories uses Omniture and Google Analytics to analyze traffic to this web site. Unlike some tracking services, Omniture and Google Analytics do not create individual profiles for each visitor. Omniture and Google Analytics only collects aggregate data. For more information about Omniture, please click here.
Successories is committed to ensuring your privacy. While the web site can automatically recognize your internet service provider, we cannot specifically identify any customer. For customers who make a purchase on www.Successories.com, we do collect information on which pages you viewed within our site. This information is used to improve your overall shopping experience. We keep track of information volunteered during the order and registration processes - and we occasionally share your name and address with reputable third parties whose products we think you may enjoy.
Cookie Technology
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. The cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor and doesn't extract any information from your computer. Cookies are simply the best way for us to be able to offer you the most enjoyable and hassle-free online shopping environment.
Email Addresses
We require that all online customers provide an email address at checkout for purposes of order and shipment confirmation. If a customer gives permission, we will send promotions and information to them via email. At any time, permission status can be changed by customers to no longer receive these messages. The email addresses we collect are used exclusively by Successories.
