The online forms provide site visitors with an opportunity to request free product downloads and demos, view SuccessFactors white papers, register for free SuccessFactors online seminars, and enroll for various services. These forms require your name, company name, e-mail address, company address, phone number as well as other information to help us determine and respond to your needs related to the products and/or services requested.

This will make your information unusable in the event of unauthorized third-party interception. We store this information in a secure environment at one or more of our service providers.
SuccessFactors personnel with access to this information have been trained and advised of the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of such information and of using it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Statement, we will not share personally identifiable information with anyone outside of SuccessFactors without your prior permission unless we believe in good faith that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable law, (ii) enforce the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of SuccessFactors, our visitors, or others.
