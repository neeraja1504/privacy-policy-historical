Children's Privacy
Suggested Jobs' site is not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. Suggested Jobs is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities. Suggested Jobs does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor does Suggested Jobs target its services or site to children under the age of 13. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and receive permission from their parent or guardian prior to using Suggested Jobs or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
Protect Yourself
Suggested Jobs uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site. We strongly encourage you to exercise caution when providing information about yourself to others online, including when you apply for jobs found on Suggested Jobs.
Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer. Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.
