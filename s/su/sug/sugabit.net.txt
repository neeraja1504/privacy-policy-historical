Cookies.
incosic.com may set and access incosic.com or third party cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on the incosic.com products our visitors view and which browsers or devices our visitors use. We may also use cookies to help us provide personalized features and preferences to you within various products in a way that may be linked to individual user information you elect to share with us. We also use "action tags" to assist in delivering the cookie. These action tags allow us to compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis, by embedding a random identifying number on each user's browser. Then we track where that number shows up on our site.
We also engage third party ad networks that may place cookies on your device when accessing and using our products that collect anonymous, non-personal information regarding your access and use. This information may be used by incosic.com and its third party ad network partners to identify and target related advertising to the user of such computer, when on our sites within the third partyâ€™s advertising network of sites. For information about opting-out of third party ad network cookies, please see the opt-out section below.
Sharing.
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on us. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of incosic.com's or such product's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
Products may use third party service providers to serve ads, search listings, and other information. These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness and use information so we can provide a better search experience to you. For this purpose, we may also provide these third party service providers anonymous information about your site navigation.
Mergers; Business Transitions.
In the event incosic.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
Notification of Changes.
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement in places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If, however, we are going to use Individually Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our site for 30 days.
