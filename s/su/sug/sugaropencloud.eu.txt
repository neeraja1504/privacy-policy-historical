Why you are required to provide personal data
In general, your provision of any personal data or granting of consent to a processing activity is entirely voluntary. However, there are certain circumstances in which SugarCRM cannot take action without processing certain personal data, for example to process your orders, or to assist you with use of our Services, or to provide access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will not be possible for SugarCRM to provide what you request without the relevant personal information. In some circumstances, SugarCRM may need to terminate your ability to use the Services without access to your personal data. SugarCRM intends to notify you of whether such communication or data sharing is deemed mandatory and the impact of not sharing.
Sharing of your personal data
SugarCRM is a global organisation with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share data about you with other SugarCRM entities and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified in this Privacy Policy. Our procedures are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information by all SugarCRM entities.
In some cases we use suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyse, and otherwise process information on our behalf. We may also use subcontractors which provide services to us in connection with providing our Services to you. We put in place contractual safeguards for the protection of your personal data with such suppliers, including obligations for processing in line with applicable legal requirements.
We may also disclose your personal information to other business partners. Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, we will only do so with your consent. We do not in any event sell or lease any of your personal information.
Where you post information to our wikis, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms, websites or other social networking environments, your information will be shared with audiences within those platforms.
We may share your personal data based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. We may use your personal data as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity, to respond to a judicial process or valid government inquiry or as otherwise required by law.
Where we process personal data
If you choose to provide us with information, including personal data, you understand that we are storing this and/or transferring it to SugarCRM's locations and systems in the United States or to the locations and systems of SugarCRM's affiliates or service providers around the world. SugarCRM complies with applicable law when transferring your personal information outside of the country there the information is collected. For data originating from a European Union member state, SugarCRM uses a variety of data transfer mechanisms (including standard contractual clauses) for this purpose.
SugarCRM has also certified under the EU- U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield address the collection, protection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of data transferred from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States. To learn more about SugarCRM's certification, please visit the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNjnAAG and refer to our Privacy Shield Notice.
How long we retain your personal data
The duration of processing of your personal data depends on the legal basis for the processing.
SugarCRM's policy is to retain personal data no longer than (a) is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the personal data is processed, (b) if processing is based on consent, until you withdraw your consent, or (c) if processing is based on a legitimate interest of SugarCRM, until you object to such processing.
However, we will store personal data for a longer period where (a) we are required by law to retain your personal data or (b) your personal data is required for SugarCRM to assert or defend against legal claims. In this event, we will retain your personal data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled. If you require more details with respect to the retention periods, please contact us at dataprivacy@sugarcrm.com.
