Marketing
We want to personalize your experience with Superherostuff.com so that you get the most relevant information about our products and services at the right time. Superherostuff.com does this by creating a profile of you for marketing purposes allowing us to only recommend products we think you're going to like. We will build your profile based on information you give us and we may supplement this information with marketing insight from third party companies and information in the public domain. You don’t have to give Superherostuff.com any of the following information, but without it, we cannot tailor our marketing to suit you and we may not be able to fulfill your order if you buy online.
When you sign up to receive our emails,  Superherostuff.com will remember your email address. If you tell us exactly what you’re interested in when you sign up, Superherostuff.com can make sure we only send you information about the products we know you want to hear about.
When you go on our Site,  Superherostuff.com may analyze how you use our Site by recording your mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling, and any text keyed into website forms (not including bank details or any sensitive personal data). Superherostuff.com uses this information to improve our Site usability and may use your activity on our Site to personalize marketing to you when you visit other websites.
When you make a purchase from us online,  Superherostuff.com will remember your name and email address along with purchase history so we can make sure you’re the first to find out about products people like you are buying, and products that will complement the ones you already bought from us. If you don’t complete your purchase, Superherostuff.com will keep track of what you put in your shopping cart for when you return to our Site, and may remind you of what is in your shopping cart via email or banners on other websites.
When you link with us on social media, Superherostuff.com may use the information you have publicly shared on social media to make sure you only get product recommendations from us that are suited to you. If you give us information about your friends (which you should only do with their permission), Superherostuff.com may recommend suitable products to them. If you submit user-generated content through our social media channels, we may use your username or email address to communicate with you in addition to using your photo. We may also use your IP address and geolocation to filter content by region, country, or other local area. Such data is only used with your consent. You can unsubscribe from Superherostuff.com’s marketing communications at any time by clicking on the link found at the bottom of every marketing email.
Safe Shopping Guarantee
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account. If your credit card provider does hold you liable for any part of this $50, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at our website while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
