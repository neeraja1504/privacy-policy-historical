Types and Uses of Collected Information
SupportBee collects two types of information about you:
a. Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities on this Website or through your participation in the SupportBee Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the SupportBee Service (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, and date of birth. When you enroll in the SupportBee Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information, such as credit card information. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity. Depending on the Identification Activity, SupportBee may not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us under the SupportBee Service.
If you choose to refer someone through the SupportBee Service, we will ask you for your referral’s contact information, such as his or her name and email address. We may then send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Website and/or join the SupportBee Service. SupportBee stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and maintaining the SupportBee Service. Your friend may contact us at support@supportbee.com request that we remove his or her contact information from our records.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website and the SupportBee Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website and SupportBee Service use, improve the Website and the SupportBee Service, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy. If you use our Website or the SupportBee Service to send information to another person, we may store your personal information.

b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website or otherwise participating in the SupportBee Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website or the SupportBee Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website or use the SupportBee Service through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy.
We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website and the SupportBee Service, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.
