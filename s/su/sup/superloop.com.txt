Part 1: Customers
Collection Data collected from our customers
In order to provide our customers with Services, or to perform a function related to providing our customers with Services, Superloop may need to collect and process certain data from our customers, which may include personal information relating to their staff or private individuals ( Collection Data ). This includes, in particular, the following types of data:
customer contact details (such as the customer's name, address and contact phone number, in addition to the name, position and email address of members of staff who contact Superloop on behalf of the customer);
customer credit card details;
credit information about the customer;
each customer's password and username for accessing Superloop's Services; and
records of each customer's use of Services and that customer's communications with Superloop.
As Superloop may also collect personal information such as names and contact details from our customers' employees or authorised representatives, each customer must make sure that they have obtained the consent of such employees or authorised representatives to Superloop collecting and using such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
The Data Controller with regards to the Collection Data and the related Services is Superloop Limited or, if you are located in one of the countries with a local Superloop subsidiary, this local subsidiary is the data controller.
Providing the Collection Data is voluntary and based on the free will of the individual or entity providing the Collection Data. However, if a customer does not provide Superloop with the information Superloop needs, Superloop may not be able to provide that customer with the Services that customer wants or Superloop may be restricted in the way that Services can be supplied.
How Collection Data is collected
Superloop usually collects Collection Data when our customers interact directly with Superloop. For example, Superloop collects information when our customers and members of staff provide information to Superloop in person, by phone or email, or when customer details are entered on our websites. Superloop may also collect Collection Data, including from:
anyone authorised to act on a customer's behalf;
Superloop's employees, agents, contractors and suppliers;
credit reporting bodies and credit providers;
other telecommunication and information service providers; and
public sources.
How Superloop uses Collection Data

investigating complaints and carrying out dispute resolution;
administering Superloop's agreement with each customer;
product research and development, business planning and staff training;
communicating with our customers about the Services; and
