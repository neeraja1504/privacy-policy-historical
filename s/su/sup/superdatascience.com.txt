Privacy Protection for Children Using the Internet
Protecting children's privacy is important to us.

We request that all users of the Web site and the Learning Platform who are under the age of thirteen (13) not disclose or provide any Personal Information. If we discover that a child under thirteen (13) has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete that child's Personal Information from our records.
Notice to Minors
In addition to protecting the privacy of children under age (13) we are committed to protect the privacy of minors.
