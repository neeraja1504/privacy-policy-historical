I. Collection and processing of your personal data
You can usually visit our site without needing to provide personal data. We collect personal data only if you furnish it of your own accord, e.g. if you contact us by e-mail or when you log in or enroll for a training course. It goes without saying that we treat this personal information confidentially. It is processed solely for the intended purpose. If you decide to become a contractual partner of ours, we collect, process and use your personal data as part of the contractual relationship. We inform you of the purposes for and extent to which we collect, process and use your data when the contract is concluded.

This information is vital to enable technical transfer of the Internet site and secure server operation. This data is only evaluated for operational and statistical purposes. Such analyses allow us to operate our websites securely and adapt them optimally to your needs. A personalized analysis of the data is not conducted, nor is the data disclosed to third parties, either for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
We erase the data on usage as soon as processing or use of it is no longer necessary for utilization of the Internet site.

VI. Share-Function in the SupplyOn Corporate Blog

B. Information on data protection
SupplyOn processes personal data of SupplyOn customers and interested parties in two different scenarios:
A) For SupplyOn’s own purposes in order to advertise or sell SupplyOn products.
B) On behalf of the purchasing companies that use SupplyOn services to carry out processes with their suppliers.
After logging into the SupplyOn Portal, you can see which purchasing company is responsible in your case as follows:
If your company is registered with SupplyOn as a supplier, your responsible user administrator can use the menu item Administration > Connect > Connect Overview Customers see with which purchasing company your company cooperates via SupplyOn. You can determine your responsible user administrators via the menu item Administration > My-User-Administrators.
As a non-registered supplier, you can view the responsible purchasing company via the corresponding link to your business transaction, which you received from SupplyOn by e-mail.
If you are a user of SupplyOn services and are working for a purchasing company, this company is also responsible.
Alternatively, please send your request for the determination of the responsible purchasing company to datenschutz@supplyon.com. Please note that we will have to verify your identity and ask for further information in order to process the legitimacy of your request. However, we will never ask you for your user password.

The legal basis for this is express consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) and Art. 7 GDPR in conjunction with. Section 7 para. 2 German Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG).

The use of SupplyOn Services itself finds its legal basis for you as a contact or employee of a purchasing company in Art. 88 Para. 1 GDPR in conjunction with. 26 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG-neu) and serves in relation to your employer the fulfilment of the obligations from your respective employment relationship.
4. Recipients of data and integration of service providers outside the EU/EEA
A) For SupplyOn’s own purposes
Your personal data may be passed on to supporting service providers in connection with subscribing to certain SupplyOn services. These supporting service providers are either subject to strict instructions within the framework of commissioned processing and are obliged under data protection law via a corresponding contract for commissioned processing pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR or we transmit your personal data on the basis of a legal basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR. As far as the supporting service providers are based outside the EU/EEA, we have ensured the legality of data transmission by means of suitable guarantees (e.g. by means of a corresponding EU standard contract according to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR).
B) For processing on behalf of the purchasing companies
In connection with the provision of SupplyOn services on behalf of a purchasing company (as a commissioned SaaS service), SupplyOn is the primary recipient of your personal data.
SupplyOn will not pass on your personal data to third parties without documented instructions from the purchasing company, unless there is a statutory obligation to do so in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.
Your personal data is passed on to external partners (operating partners and other subcontractors) depending on the scope of the SupplyOn SaaS service. These external partners support us in data processing within the framework of commissioned processing in accordance with strict instructions and are bound by data protection law by means of a corresponding contract for commissioned processing in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. Where the external partners are based outside the EU/EEA, SupplyOn has ensured the legality of data transmission by means of suitable guarantees (e.g. by means of a corresponding EU standard contract in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR). On request, we will be pleased to provide you with an overview of the external partners relevant to your case.
5. Criteria for the deletion of data
A) For SupplyOn’s own purposes
SupplyOn restricts the use of your personal data for the purpose of providing information about SupplyOn services as soon as you restrict or completely revoke your consent to the content of this information.
In addition, SupplyOn will delete your personal data for the purpose of providing information about SupplyOn services as soon as you are no longer registered as a user (e.g. termination of contract between SupplyOn and the company for which you work). This shall only apply if SupplyOn has no legal obligations to retain data in order to prevent such data from being deleted. In this case, the deletion is replaced by a restriction on the processing of your personal data.
B) For processing on behalf of the purchasing companies
SupplyOn deletes your personal data on the instructions of the purchasing company and upon termination of the contract between SupplyOn and the purchasing company or the corresponding supplying company, provided that SupplyOn has no legal obligation to retain the data. In this case, the deletion is replaced by a restriction on the processing of your personal data.
6. Existing rights: information, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, data portability, complaint to supervisory authority
Regardless of which company is responsible for data processing in detail (see section B, paragraph 1) you are entitled to various rights relating to data subjects, which we would like to explain to you below.
Data subjects have the right to obtain information from the data controller about personal data concerning them and to have inaccurate data corrected or deleted if one of the reasons stated in Art. 17 GDPR applies, e.g. if the data are no longer required for the purposes pursued. Furthermore, there is a right to limitation of processing if one of the conditions specified in Art. 18 GDPR applies and in the cases of Art. 20 GDPR the right to data transferability. If data is collected based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e (data processing for the fulfilment of official tasks or for the protection of the public interest) or lit. f (data processing for the protection of legitimate interests), the data subject is entitled to object to the processing at any time for reasons arising from his particular situation. We will then no longer process the personal data unless there are demonstrably compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
In addition, any data subject has the right of appeal to a supervisory authority if he or she considers that the processing of data concerning him or her is in breach of data protection legislation. The right of appeal may be exercised in particular before a supervisory authority in the Member State of residence of the person concerned or the place where the alleged infringement occurred. The supervisory authority responsible for SupplyOn in Bavaria is the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht), Promenade 27 (Schloss), 91522 Ansbach, Germany.
Please contact the person responsible to exercise your rights. We would be pleased to support you! The necessary information to contact us can be found in section B, paragraph 2.
7. Consequence of not providing personal data
Regardless of which company is responsible for data processing in detail (see section B, paragraph 1):
The provision of your personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, nor for the conclusion of a contract. As a user of SupplyOn Services, you are not obliged to provide your personal data. The consequence of not providing your personal data would be that SupplyOn Services will not be activated for you and you will not be able to use them.
