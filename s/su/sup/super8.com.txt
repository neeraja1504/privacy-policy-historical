Cookies: This Website uses “cookies.” By using this Website and agreeing to this Notice, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this Notice. Cookies are small text files that this Website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and this information is stored in a file on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to this Website.
One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website. A cookie may save a user’s login details, for example, so that the user does not need to login every time. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with your personal information.
Cookies may be either “persistent” or “temporary” (or “session”) cookies. A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular Website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user before the expiration date). A temporary cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us as well as by third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to advertiser cookies, we do permit those cookies to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and to monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in, for example, holidays or hobbies. These cookies run advertisements tailored to the user based on the user’s online buying habits.
For a current list of the advertising partners who use cookies on this Website, and to modify your cookies settings, please access our Cookie Consent tool. Additionally, your browser may be set to allow you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed on your browser, decline the cookie, or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Some functions of our Websites may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused.
Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics to help us get a better understanding of how visitors use this Website. The information generated by the Google Analytics cookie about your use of this Website is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do not want your activity on this Website to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may opt out by using this link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
Other Non-Personal Information: In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on the Websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Websites. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information. We may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Websites. In addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a " Device Identifier "). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Computer, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our Websites are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Websites, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the personally identifiable information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.
We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information.
* Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op: WHG participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our Websites across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions. Go to https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com to learn more about how Adobe does this and to manage your choices relating to this linking of devices.
* From Other Sources: We may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.
