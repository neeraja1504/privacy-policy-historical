Certain visitors to SupportSystem’s websites choose to interact with SupportSystem in ways that require SupportSystem to gather personally-identifying information.

In each case, SupportSystem collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SupportSystem.
