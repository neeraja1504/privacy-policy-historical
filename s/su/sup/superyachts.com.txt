6.0 Yacht Particulars On Superyachts.com
Superyachts.com policy is that only those brokers with central management rights awarded to them by yacht owners or operators can market a yacht on Our Site. We believe this policy is important as it helps to preserve the accuracy of the data for yachts available for sale or for charter. We cannot warrant the accuracy of the information displayed about any yacht advertised and You should always check the particulars with the agent concerned before relying on the content of this Site.
If You are the owner of a yacht being displayed for sale or for charter on Our Website, this is because the Marketing Agent You have chosen to use has a contract with us to display the details of Your yacht on Our Website and thereby placed the technical information about Your yacht fully in the public domain. Details held by us about a yacht do not comprise of personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998.
If Your yacht is listed for sale or charter on superyachts.com and You require some or all information to be removed, such a request should be submitted to us via the Marketing Agent linked to Your yacht. If a Marketing Agent proclaims to have the right to market Your yacht when in fact no such rights have been granted or no Marketing Agent is directly linked to Your yacht, please inform us in writing and We shall suspend Your yacht from being advertised for sale or charter until such time that We receive evidence that a Marketing Agent has been granted the appropriate rights to market Your yacht on Your behalf.
