1. BRANCHOUT BASICS
Through the BranchOut Services, you have the opportunity for potential employers, business partners, BranchOut customers, professional contacts and friends to find and learn about you based on your existing Facebook profile, which is the basis for your BranchOut profile. We allow our members to learn about business opportunities and jobs and obtain Introductions.
Users may be individual job seekers, recruiters, sales professionals or others looking for professional connections. There are primarily two types of users on BranchOut:
BranchOut User. A BranchOut User is a user who has registered to join BranchOut by installing any of the BranchOut Services or who has otherwise logged into BranchOut to use the BranchOut Services.
Connections. Your Connections consist of your connections to (1) other BranchOut Users and (2) persons who are not BranchOut Users, but are connected to you through your Facebook social network (e.g., a Facebook friend or a second-degree Facebook friend). A BranchOut User who searches for a job, a company or organization, or a person on BranchOut will see any Connections he or she has to the applicable company (or organization) or person.
Enterprise Users. Enterprise Users are BranchOut Users who are recruiters, sales professionals and other customers looking for qualified candidates, business partners, and sales leads. We may charge Enterprise Users a fee for accessing the BranchOut Services and we may offer special services to Enterprise Users. Like all BranchOut Users, Enterprise Users will have access to view your BranchOut Profile and Connections and may contact you through the communication tools provided by Facebook.
Please note that your BranchOut Profile and your Connections will be visible to all other users of BranchOut. You will be able to contact other BranchOut users through their Facebook page and in accordance with their settings on Facebook. Other BranchOut Users will be able to contact you in the same way, also in accordance with your settings through Facebook.

2. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE BRANCHOUT SERVICES
Information We Receive From Facebook
BranchOut believes that your friends and family are your true support network both personally and professionally. Thus, BranchOut allows you to establish a professional network on BranchOut based on your Facebook friends and their network.
By accessing BranchOut with your Facebook log-in credentials, you are authorizing BranchOut to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to BranchOut.

BranchOut will access and store certain information from your current Facebook profile (for example, your first and last name, email address, current city and state, your work history and education, your profile picture, your Facebook user ID number and demographic information, such as your age and gender, as well as other information that you have made public on Facebook), all in accordance with the permissions you have granted BranchOut.
