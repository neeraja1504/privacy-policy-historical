You may elect to share certain personal information with individuals or with the public via your use of the Website.  In this case, you will control such sharing via settings that we provide. For example, the Website may make it possible for you to publicly share information via social media such as Facebook or Twitter.  Be aware that when you choose to share information with friends, public officials, or with the public at large, you may be disclosing sensitive information or information from which sensitive information can be inferred.  Always use caution when sharing information through the Website. You understand and agree that we are not responsible for any consequences of your sharing of information through and beyond the Website.

After registering for an account on the Website, you may log-in to the account and edit your personal information in your profile.  For instructions on how you can further access your personal information that we have collected, or how to correct errors in such information, please send an e-mail to support@Minecade.com.   We will also promptly stop using your information and remove it from our servers and database at any time upon your e-mail request.  To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access, making corrections or removing your information.
*How Do We Store and Protect Your Information?*
After receiving your personal information, we will store it on our Website systems for future use.  We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect.  Unfortunately, no data transmission or data storage solution can ever be completely secure. As a result, although we take industry-standard steps to protect your information (e.g., strong encryption), we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or receive from us or that we store on our or our service providers' systems.
If you are visiting the Website from outside of the USA, you understand that your connection will be through and to servers located in the USA, and the information you provide will be securely stored in our web servers and internal systems located within the USA.
We store personal information for as long as reasonably required for its purpose. Account information is deleted when you or when we delete your account.  We may store information longer for legitimate business reasons (for example, personal information may remain in backups for a reasonable period of time), or as legally required.  Otherwise, we store your personal information until you request us to remove it from our servers. We store our logs and other technical records indefinitely.
*How Do We Use Cookies And Other Network Technologies?*
To enhance your online experience with us, our web pages may presently or in the future use "cookies."  Cookies are text files that our web server may place on your hard disk to store your preferences.  We may use session, persistent, first-party and third-party cookies.  Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other PII unless you choose to provide this information to us.  Once you choose to provide PII, however, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, providing you with as much control as you wish as to the decision to accept/reject the cookie, and deletion of the cookie upon leaving our Website.  Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Website.
We or our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," “embedded links” and other commonly-used information-gathering tools in connection with some Website pages and HTML-formatted email messages.  We use these tools for such purposes as compiling aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates. A pixel tag is an electronic image (often a single pixel), that is ordinarily not visible to website visitors, and may be associated with cookies on visitors’ hard drives.  Pixel tags allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver customized services, and to help determine the effectiveness of our Website and Services. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, pixel tags can inform the sender of the email whether and when the email has been opened.
As you use the Internet, you leave a trail of electronic information at each website you visit.  This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data”, can be collected and stored by a website's server.  Clickstream data can reveal the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Website.  We may use clickstream data as a form of non-PII to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Website, how visitors navigate through the Website, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.  We will only use this information to improve our Website.
At this time, the Website and Services do not specifically respond to do-not-track signals.
*Collection of Information by Others*
Our Terms of Service document identifies certain third-party websites to which we may provide links that you may click on our Website.   Please check the privacy policies of these other websites to learn how they collect, use, store and share information that you may submit to them or that they collect.
*Children and Young People’s Information*
We comply with all applicable privacy laws affecting minors including the GDPR, USA Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and associated Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) rules for collecting personal information from minors.  Please see the FTC's website (www.ftc.gov) for more information. Our Website will not knowingly accept personal information from anyone under 13 years old in violation of applicable laws, without the consent of a parent or guardian.  In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided PII to us without parental consent, we will make efforts to delete the child’s information in accordance with the COPPA.  If you have concerns about this Website or its Services, wish to find out if your child has accessed our Services, or wish to remove your child's personal information from our servers, please contact us at support@Minecade.com.
*California Privacy Rights*
California law allows California residents to request information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of their PII to third parties. To make such a request, please contact us at support@Minecade.com.  Please include enough detail for us to locate your file; at a minimum, your name, email and username, if any.  We will attempt to provide you with the requested information within thirty (30) days of receipt. We reserve our right not to respond to requests sent more than once in a calendar year, or requests submitted to an address other than the one posted in this notice. Please note that this law does not cover all information sharing.  Our disclosure only includes information covered by the law.
*Changes to this Policy*
Because our business needs may change over time, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy.  If at any time in the future we plan to use your PII in a way that differs from this Privacy Policy, we will revise this Privacy Policy as appropriate.  In the event of a change to our Privacy Policy, we will email the updated policy to the email address that you provided to us.  Your continued use of the Website following our notice of changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
