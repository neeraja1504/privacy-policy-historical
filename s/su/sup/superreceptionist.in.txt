5. Exclusions/ External Links – Information that you provide to non-Knowlarity companies is not covered by this Policy. For example: When you download applications or make an online purchase from a non-Knowlarity company while using Knowlarity’s services or click on certain links which may direct you to other websites not maintained by Knowlarity (the “Third Party Website”) , the information collected by the non-Knowlarity company/ Third Party Website is not subject to this Policy. If you use public forums — such as social networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs on Knowlarity or non-Knowlarity websites — you should be aware that any Personal Information you disclose publicly can be read, collected, or used by others. Once you choose to reveal Personal Information on such a site, the information is publicly available, and Knowlarity cannot prevent distribution and use of that information by other parties. You hereby further acknowledge and agree that Knowlarity has no control over the Information in such an event. Knowlarity urges you to acquaint yourself with the terms and conditions and privacy policy of every such Third Party Website and in this regard, Knowlarity hereby expressly disclaims all liabilities with respect to the manner in which the Third Party Website collects and/or uses the Information. Knowlarity may enter into written product or service agreements with business customers that contain specific provisions related to the confidentiality, security or other handling of information. When provisions of a written product or service agreement differ from or conflict with the provisions of this Policy, the terms of the written agreement will apply. In all other instances, the terms of this Policy apply.
6. Security – We have established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to secure the information we collect, to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of that information and to ensure it is used appropriately. Although we strive to keep your Personal Information secure, no security measures are absolute, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy). We will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that Knowlarity has experienced a security breach and there is a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where otherwise required by law.
7. Policies – We have established policies and practices to meet the expectations of Customers and potential customers who have expressed a desire to limit certain types of solicitation communications from Knowlarity, including marketing contacts made via telephone, e-mail and text messaging. You also can request to be removed from these telemarketing lists when you receive a marketing or promotional call. Where required by laws and/or regulations, we honor requests from businesses to be removed from our telemarketing lists. The TRAI maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at “ndnc.in”. Putting your number on these Registries also may limit our telemarketing calls to that number. Our practices as described above are designed to satisfy legal requirements limiting marketing contacts. You should know that those laws and regulations — such as the requirements governing the national “Do Not Call” lists — generally permit companies to contact their own current and, in some cases, former customers, even when those customers are listed on the national “Do Not Call” lists. Similarly, restricting our use of your CPNI will not eliminate all types of Knowlarity marketing contacts.
8. Online Advertising – Knowlarity works hard to detect and prevent junk e-mails (also referred to as “spam” e-mails) from ever reaching your computer. However, if you are receiving unwanted spam from a Knowlarity e-mail address, please contact us for assistance at support@knowlarity.com.
