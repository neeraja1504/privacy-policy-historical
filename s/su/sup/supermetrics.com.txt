Privacy Policy | Supermetrics
Effective: 4 September 2019
1. Introduction
We practice privacy and security by design.
Please read our full document below to understand details between where we are a Data Controller ( your Supermetrics account data , company information etc.)  and where we are a Data Processor (when we process your data through our systems into Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, Microsoft Excel, Tableau etc.)
2. Privacy and security as data processor
This section summarizes our commitments to you where we are a Data Processor (when we process your data through our systems into Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, Microsoft Excel, Tableau etc.)
When it comes to being a data processor, the data is never stored permanently on our systems. In the majority of cases, we process your data in real time. To improve performance, we may cache your query results on our servers as needed for the success of your query. Please note that any time we cache query results we strongly encrypt the data. Any caches are deleted once they are unnecessary or when you cease use of our systems.
Our staff is trained regularly on handling data and our systems are monitored constantly. Our staff have access as needed. For any data we process, your data is extremely restricted and we will only access it at your written request or in the case where we need to debug and solve problems. In each case all such access is audited.
We do not share the data you process with us with any party.
In some cases you may be given the option and/or have chosen the option to have your data processed in specific region(s) or in specific data center(s). In such cases we will give you the guarantee such processing will happen in the specified manner and any changes will be communicated to you.
Supermetrics tools only use official APIs (application programming interfaces) for accessing data.
Data transfers are done using SSL encrypted HTTPS connections.
For logging into most of the data sources, our tools use OAuth. This is a secure authentication method, which means that you never have to type your password into our tools, as the authentication happens on a webpage hosted by the data source (eg. Google, Facebook or Microsoft).
With Google services, our tools will only have rights to access your Google Analytics/AdWords/YouTube data (depending on which service you are logging in to), nothing else on your Google account. You can revoke Supermetrics’ right to access your data at any point from your Google account control panel. For your reference you should view  the Terms of Service for Youtube, and Google Analytics, as well as Google’s Privacy Policy as you will be bound to these terms when you connect and fetch your data from these services.
Most other services we connect to also work with OAuth, and provide their own interface for revoking access rights.
There are a few services that still require you to type your username and password, or API key, into our tools. Any tokens, keys or passwords are stored encrypted in our systems.
Our data processing and storage happens in monitored and highly scalable, best-in-class data centers managed by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Our security is audited annually by an external third party.
