If a person chooses to opt-out, Super Duper Inc. is required to stop sending emails to that person. Super Duper Inc. puts a high value on a person's ability to discontinue receiving unwanted email.
Super Duper Inc. utilizes temporary Cookie technology for web site traffic analysis such as the time/date of the visit, the time/date of last visit, the page viewed, the referrer, transaction information for eCommerce pages, and other data. Super Duper Inc. utilizes persistent Cookie technology for optional account log-in. Super Duper Inc. tracks click behavior in the emails it sends out. We use this data to update specific user-profile information, ascertain the areas of most interest to opt-in email recipients, and to personalize email messages to them.
If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via our system (or purportedly sent), please forward a copy of that email with your comments to customerhelp@superduperinc.com for review.
We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time. Updated: June 26, 2009.
