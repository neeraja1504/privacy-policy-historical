Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
We review this privacy policy regularly. Occasionally we may need to make changes or additions to this privacy policy that may affect how we handle your data.

INFORMATION COLLECTION
When you register on our Site, we will collect some personal information from you, such as your name, email address, date of birth, country of origin, location, social media accounts and other data you upload or enter into your profile. This personal data is entered by you during the application or registration process or shared by you through another social media service, in order to become a member of SUPERFUTURE, or other use of SUPERFUTURE Services.
Purchase of our products on our websites. While your credit card number is validated on the Site, your credit card number and payment details are stored exclusively by our third party payment providers and not by us.
We may also collect data about your navigation of the Site on an aggregate basis, such as your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”), which is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you navigate the Site, your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), your login frequency, the pages you visited within the Site, and the Internet browser or device you are using.
You may also voluntarily provide personal information when you send us an enquiry or support request via email. When you contact us, we keep a record of your communication, and may use third party service providers (e-mail system provider).
Any information you disclose in public areas of the Site may become public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these areas. We are not responsible for any use by third parties of personal information disclosed by you in public areas of the Site.
COOKIES

WHO WE SHARE WITH
When you submit information to SUPERFUTURE, it is collected, processed and maintained solely by us or by our third party contractors, those third party contractors being bound by our privacy policy or by restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this policy.
We will never disclose private member data, including email addresses, to partners without your prior express consent.
We may disclose your personal information:
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating our Terms of Service or other rules or if we believe you are causing injury or interference with the rights of members, the general public or SUPERFUTURE;
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be some of the transferred assets; and
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our customers, or others.
In the event that you raise a payment dispute and your bank or credit card provider requests data supporting your transaction and use of the SUPERFUTURE Service.

WHERE WE STORE AND TRANSFER
Our servers are based in United States of America. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed on our behalf by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, including but not limited to countries such as Australia. By consenting to the collection and processing of your personal data, you agree to such transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
The transfer, storage or processing of personal information outside the EEA does not diminish your rights and we will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that any information that is transferred, stored or processed outside the EEA will be treated securely, in accordance with this privacy policy and with the same level of protection required by the EEA Data Protection.
DATA RETENTION
SUPERFUTURE may retain information submitted by you following application/termination/deactivation of your Membership, ensuring that you will benefit from communications, and to allow for (re-)activation of your Membership at a later point in time. If you de-register from all SUPERFUTURE Services, we may retain information submitted by you or collected from you, for such time as is reasonably necessary for backup, archival and/or audit purposes, to prevent fraud or other criminal activity, or prevent violation of our Terms of Service and for such time as may be required by applicable laws.
We will remove personal information by deleting it from our database if required to do so by law. We will also delete personal information upon your request in line with the right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) according to Art. 17 GDPR and similar local and national regulations elsewhere. According to Art. 16 GDPR (and similar local and national regulations elsewhere), following the right to rectification, we will also rectify inaccurate personal data concerning you (for both, send e-mail request to legal@superfuture.com).
We regularly review the way we collect, store and process information, including physical security measures, in order to protect our systems from any unauthorised access.
All of our services are fully encrypted using SSL. Access to any personal information is limited to SUPERFUTURE staff, contractors and agents, to the extent relevant to their job duties (such as processing certain information). Anyone with access to private data is bound by strict confidentiality obligations.
ACCESS TO INFORMATION
GDPR and other local and national regulations give you the right to access personal data held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with these Acts, subject to any fees that SUPERFUTURE may be permitted to charge you under such Acts (send e-mail request to legal@superfuture.com).
NOTIFICATION OF NEW USES
On occasion, we may use personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy policy. In such cases, we will notify you of the content and purposes of the change by email. If you do not oppose such change in writing (by email to legal@superfuture.com) within ten (10) days of the date of the email, the changes will be deemed accepted by you. Any data collection changes will be effective from then on. We will not retroactively collect data for new collection procedures.
