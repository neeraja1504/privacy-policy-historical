Introduction
SupChina, Inc. (“SupChina”, “we,” or “us”) is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information SupChina collects from you when you visit our website supchina.com (the “Site”), use our mobile applications (the “Apps”), or use any other product and services made available by us (collectively, the Site and Apps, the “Services”) and how we use, share and protect that information. If any term in this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, please do not use the Services or provide us with any personal data.
We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. The use of information collected through our Services will be limited to the purposes described under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service (or other relevant customer contracts). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy for that entity and are representing to us that you have the authority to do so (in which case “you” will refer to that entity). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Services.
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, e-mail or through other reasonable means. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.
Information We Collect and How We Collect Information
The information we collect from you falls into two categories: personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). Personal Information includes your name, telephone number, physical address, email address, company name, and company address.  Non-Personal Information includes your IP address and browser type, the name of the website from which you entered our Site, and which pages you visit on our Site.
We process personal data as defined under data protection laws in various ways depending upon your use of the Services. We process personal data on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interest in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedom related to data privacy.
Below are the various ways in which we may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal information from you.
Information We Automatically Collect. We and third-party service providers acting on our behalf, which may include third-party analytics service providers and third-party advertisers, may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies” that allow us to track the actions of users of our Services automatically. For example, we may automatically collect information about your location, your internet connection, your browser, when you access the Services, the website address that linked you to our Site, the website that you visit after using our Services, and details of how you used our Services, such as how often you used our Services and which features of the Services you used.
Third-Party Information Collection. We may also use third-party services that use cookies and/or similar technologies to collect and analyze data about the App or Site use, to complete business transactions and to report on activities and trends.  Such services may also collect data regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online services. The use of this information by those third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies, including, for example, Google’s Analytics Privacy Policy.  For more information, please go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.  We may also use the data collected to deliver targeted advertising to you.
Our analytics partners may collect your IP address, which is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be logged when you access the platform, along with the time of the visit. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate location (on a city or region level) from your IP address.
Publicly Posted. If you post information on public areas of the Site (i.e. comments or blog), that information is visible to and may be collected, stored and used by anyone. By posting information, you agree that you have obtained all necessary consents to make such information public and that doing so will not violate any laws. If you remove information that you have made public through our Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of our Services or if other users have copied or saved that information. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share Personal Information.
Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us. If you contact us by phone, email, instant message, live chat, social media, or by some other means, we may keep a record of your contact information (including your name, company name, email, address and phone number) and the correspondence. When we send you emails, we may also track whether you open them to determine how to deliver more helpful emails and improve our Services.
User Accounts. We will collect and store the information you provide to us if you create an account, such as your name, company name, company address, phone number and email address. You do not have to share this information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain features or participate in certain aspects of the Services.
Financial Information. If you purchase our Services, you may be required to provide financial information, such as your credit card or bank account number, to a third-party payment processor. We do not collect or store such financial information and we are not responsible for the collection or storage of such information by third parties. We will, however, have access to certain information associated with your account should you purchase the Services, including the amount and date of the purchase.

Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of the information you provide to us. The mechanisms listed below aim to provide you with control over such collection, use, and disclosure:
Marketing Communication. If you do not want us to send you marketing or promotional communications, you can opt-out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any such promotional emails, checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data or emailing us at office@supchina.com.
Cookies. You have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through your browser. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. If you choose to disable your cookies, your user experience may be limited.

Mobile Analytics .  If you are using our Apps, we use Mobile Device IDs, instead of cookies, to recognize you. We use the Mobile Device IDs and other mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. These Mobile Device IDs are only tracking and collecting Non-Personal Information. The software may record information such as how often you use the Services, the events that occur within the Apps, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Apps were downloaded from.

We may collect the physical location of your device by using, for example, satellite, cell phone tower, GPS or WiFi signals.  We use your device’s physical location to provide you with location-based services and content. You may be able to allow or deny such collection and/or use through your device settings or the App’s privacy controls.
Third-Party Advertising. If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web advertisements, you may visit the following websites: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. These opt-out tools are provided by third parties. We do not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within our Services even if you opt out of tailored advertising but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated websites.
Do Not Track Signals. Third parties may keep track of your browsing activities across third party websites. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals. Certain web browsers enable users to activate a “Do Not Track” signal but we do not currently respond to the “Do Not Track” signal or other similar mechanisms.
Notice to California Residents. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
