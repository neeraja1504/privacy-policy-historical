What information does SuperMediaStore.com collect?
In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, we collect two forms of visitor information: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Some of this information is collected by third parties who may be placing and reading cookies on visitors’ browsers, or may use web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in connection with promotions or programs such as the Google Trusted Stores program. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a customized, smooth, and efficient shopping session.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based on where you have shopped for on our web site in several ways. This information is then compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregate basis. Such non-personally identifiable information may include demographics and interest data. We use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics' Demographic and Interest Reporting Tools to figure out the general types of people who visit our store. Additional non-personally identifiable information may also include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route or reroute information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, which allows web servers to locate and to identify your computer. Computers require an IP addresses in order for users to communicate over the Internet.
Shopping
We collect IP addresses for the purpose of system administration, gathering broad demographic information, enabling ads to be served on our web site, reporting Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, and for monitoring the level of activity on our site. We collect information from site visitors, such as the URLs they came from, their IP addresses, domain types (e.g.., .com or .org), browser types, country, state, possible telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages viewed by customers during their visits, and any search keywords entered on our site.

When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or any services, we will collect your name, user name, account password, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product information, payment information, order number, referring URL, and IP address. We collect such information in order to fill your order, and also in order to get in contact with you regarding your order and/or to send you promotional materials. Before you submit your order, you will have the opportunity to review the order and make any changes in addition to the information that is already entered. Such changes might be automatically kept for future use.

Online Surveys and Polling

That surveyor collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information for the sole purpose of providing reports to SuperMediaStore.com about our shoppers' interests and opinions. Answers from individual surveys are kept confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and will be disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply refuse such service when asked.
