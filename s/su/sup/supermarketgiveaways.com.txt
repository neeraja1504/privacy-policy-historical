SuperMarketGiveaways  PRIVACY POLICY
Last Modified March 14, 2011
We respect and protect your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. This policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing SuperMarketGiveaways.com  (together with all sites owned or operated by SuperMarketGiveaways, collectively called the "Site") or using our services, you consent to our information practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.
How We Collect And Use Information:
This Policy describes how we store and use the information you give us. Our registration form requests that you provide certain personal information.
Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal delivery address, profession, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. We may use, sell or distribute certain individual personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to provide you with important offers.
When you register for any of our services, we ask you to provide us with personal information so that we can provide and personalize our services and marketing efforts. We use this personal information to process your registration, create your profile and to communicate with you regarding our service. Because email is an integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you'll receive information relative to your interests at the time of your enrollment, from both SuperMarketGiveaways and its partners. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link to be found in all of our marketing emails, or you can submit your unsubscribe request at http://supermarketgiveaways.com/unsub.php.
Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative emails, which include but are not limited to, notices about membership status changes and alterations to our User Agreement.
Right to Sell/License Data: This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the SuperMarketGiveaways website, and/ or have submitted their email address through our affiliate network program and other co-marketing partnerships to promote our site. We may use the personal information that you supply to us and work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email, SMS text messaging, and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing. Part of our business model involves sharing personally identifiable information, such as name and address, with third-party marketing concerns. While we cannot control the practices of our advertisers and third-party marketers, we endeavor at all times to do business with reputable partners who also follow a best practices model regarding your privacy. All information provided to us by the users of this site may be used to support our suppression, validation and enhancement services to other marketing companies, advertising agencies, compilers and data companies. As an example, opt-out information may be shared with other marketing partners so that those users opting out of further offers are suppressed from the partner’s mailings or promotions, as well as our own. In addition to complying with our users’ preferences, it simply makes good business sense to mail only to those customers who have indicated a desire to receive such mailings.
OPT-IN NOTICE: By Participating, You Expressly "Opt In" To Receive Information And Grant Us Permission To Share Your Information: Telemarketing: By accepting the terms and conditions of this website, providing your telephone number to participate, and selecting "Yes" to any question on the website promoting products or services, you are agreeing to potentially receive telemarketing calls by us or on behalf of our marketing partners or affiliated entities. Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, you give us, our partners or affiliated entities the right to contact you via telephone and you expressly waive all federal and state no-call registrations. Complete terms and conditions of any offer are available from such marketing partners. Our partners or affiliated entities who may be contacting you via telephone currently include Achieve Card (re-loadable, prepaid debit card), Career Institute, Search4Degreees, Education Advance and Grants.
SMS, Wireless and Other Mobile Offerings: This website, websites linking to this website, and websites linked from this website (collectively "We") may make available a service either directly or through third parties by which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.
We also collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you responded to e-mail messages delivered to you on our behalf. We also may compare our member list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify any of the information you have provided by following the instructions set forth below.
Cookies: A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

For example, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit member's only areas.
We also provide links to external advertisers and marketing partner companies; these sites may choose to use cookies to better promote their products and services. These advertisers and marketing partner companies have their own privacy procedures and policies that are not controlled by us.  We encourage our users to be aware of the individual privacy policies of every Web site that the user contacts.
