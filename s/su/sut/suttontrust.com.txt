How we obtain your data
Most of the data we hold is from the information you provided to the Sutton Trust when you registered for your programme, or is information you provided when you created or edited your alumni profile (through our online platform, “Sutton Trust Alumni” or our previous digital software). You may also have provided information over email, post, over the phone, or in conversation.

For example, social networking sites, company websites, publications like Who’s Who, dedicated business websites (e.g. Companies House) or publications and articles in the media (e.g. Queen’s Honours List), and may use trusted external companies to do this on our behalf.
If you agree to us sharing your personal information with our alumni programme delivery partners, they will share additional personal information with us about your engagement with them. We have provided more information about the data that we share with, and receive from, our partners in section 5 below.
We also analyse personal data we collect about you to create additional information about you.

We use this information to help us to improve the alumni relations programme, including our fundraising programme.

5. Sharing your data
5a. Delivery partners
To deliver your programme, The Trust will have shared your full application with the university you applied to. We will have also shared your contact details and access needs with other delivery partners to deliver the programme. i.e. a work experience placement provider.
We also work with select partners to deliver parts of the alumni relations programme. If you choose to interact with these partners and give your (separate and additional) consent for us to do so, some of your personal information will be shared with those partners. This will include:
Your name
Your email address
Your current address
Any education history you have shared with us (degree, university, subject)
We do this in order to make the process of signing up for their services easier. In addition, our partners will tell us about your engagement with the opportunities and services they offer. This could include your attendance at events, the type of content you are interested in, or jobs you have applied for.
These partners will assess your eligibility for the programmes they run using their own systems. They will ask you for additional data, and are separately responsible for compliance in storing and processing the data The Trust has shared with them, in addition to any additional data you supply to them. They will be in touch to share their own procedures with you. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information with our delivery partners, and you subsequently change your mind or would like to exercise any of your rights in relation to the personal information that they hold about you, you will need to contact them to do so.
The partners we are currently working with are included in Annex B.
5b. Sutton Trust programmes partners
The Trust will share your data with our evaluation partners so they can evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.
As part of the alumni relations volunteering programme, some individuals who work for the partners who deliver our core programmes (for instance our Summer Schools) will also have accounts on Sutton Trust Alumni. This group of partners will contact you on the Sutton Trust Alumni portal regarding specific opportunities should you indicate that you are interested in hearing from them, either as part of the process of signing up to Sutton Trust Alumni, by making changes to your personal profile, or by indicating by email, phone, or in conversation with them that you would be interested in those opportunities.
Our partners will assess your eligibility for the programmes they run using their own systems. They are responsible for compliance in storing and processing your personal information, and they will be in touch to share their own procedures with you.
The partners we are currently working with are included in Annex B.
5c. Evaluation partners
The Trust will share your data with our evaluation partners so they can evaluate the effectiveness of the alumni relations programme, and the Sutton Trust’s core programmes (the programme to which you originally applied, for example a Summer School). Our evaluation partners are appointed each year and will vary depending on the programme. A list of the evaluation partners the Trust currently works with are included in Annex B.
We, or our partners, will ask you to complete surveys and will link these to the data you provide to us on Sutton Trust Alumni. We will also link the data you provide to additional educational data sets to evaluate your future educational and career outcomes. This will include looking at where you go to university and what jobs you do in future. We do this so that we can measure the impact that our programmes have on participants and ensure the programme is meeting its aims of increasing access to selective universities and careers.
We will not say anything in our reports that could identify you and will not use your data in a way that would affect you individually. We have data sharing agreements in place to ensure that your data is protected and partner organisations will adequately protect your data. The current data sets we will link to are included in Annex B.
5d. Tracking
The Trust looks at where you go to university and what jobs you do in the future. We do this so that we can measure the impact that our programmes have on participants and ensure the programme is meeting its aims of increasing access to selective universities and careers. Tracking will be undertaken by the Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT) and we will share the following information to access the data sets:
Name
Date of birth
Postcode
A full list of the data sets the Trust may access are available in the Annex.
5e. Other users of the Sutton Trust Alumni platform
Sutton Trust Alumni is designed to foster connections between alumni of the Sutton Trust’s programmes. As such, many of the Alumni Personal Information you supply will be displayed to other users of the platform, including our partners who have access to the platform, as mentioned earlier. You have control over what information you would like to be shared and you can update this at any time by updating your personal profile (called ‘My Profile’), or by getting in touch with us.
5f. Third party IT service providers
We use a third-party IT service provider, Hivebrite to host and maintain the Sutton Trust Alumni portal and a CRM system called Salesforce. They will have access to personal information stored on Sutton Trust Alumni in their role as our IT service provider, but are not permitted to use your personal information for their own purposes, other than measuring the effectiveness of their services, and must only process your personal information in accordance with our instructions. Some of our third-party providers also utilise the services of other parties – for example Hivebrite uses Google analytics to track displays of traffic on the site. We require all third parties and their partners to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We are based in the UK and store our data within the EU. Some organisations which provide services to us may transfer personal data outside of the EU, but we will only allow them to do if your data is adequately protected. For example, Survey Monkey and Form Assembly who host our online surveys are US based companies. We have processing agreements in place with these organisations to ensure your data is adequately protected.
Storing and deleting your data
We hope that your relationship with the Trust will be a lifelong one, and in recognition of the lifelong nature of your relationship with the Trust, we will store and use your Alumni Personal Information for as long as you remain an alumnus of the Sutton Trust and we continue to run our alumni programme, or until we no longer have a basis upon which we can legally store or use your information (see section 2 for more information about the bases upon which we use your personal information).

we must process the data in order to carry out our legal obligations
we must process data for reasons of substantial public interest
you have already made the data public.
2.2) Failure to provide data

Automated decision-making means making decision about you using no human involvement e.g. using computerised filtering equipment.

If we have sought your consent to keep your data on file for future job vacancies, and you have provided consent, we will keep your data for nine months once the recruitment exercise ends. At the end of this period, we will delete or destroy your data, unless you have already withdrawn your consent to our processing of your data in which case it will be deleted or destroyed upon your withdrawal of consent.
Where you have provided consent to our use of your data, you also have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop processing your data and there will be no consequences of withdrawing consent.

We use your personal information to organise events; to update stakeholders on relevant policy events and reports; to communicate with journalists on relevant news, events and reports. | It is in our legitimate interest to inform stakeholders of the work we are doing. Stakeholders may find our reports/events informative and useful in shaping the discussion on these issues. Also at times we may want the input of stakeholders into the policy debate. If you are a stakeholder and you are receiving communications from us, but do not wish to do so anymore, then let us know at [email protected] and we will no longer contact you in this way.
We use your personal information where it is publicly available including party affiliation, individual interests (according to publicly available reports or from Hansard) and previous voting record to segment what information we send to stakeholders. | This activity is in our legitimate interest so that we are only sending information to you that would be of interest.
We use your personal information to conduct research reports (i.e. using publicly available information on Members of Parliament). | This activity is in our legitimate interest to conduct relevant and proper research to further our aim of improving social mobility. Some personal information will be provided to us by the individual strictly for research purposes on the basis of consent.
We use website usage data and user data (such as your IP address and details of your browser and device) to provide products and services; to enable certain website functions; to better understand how visitors use this website; and to present timely and relevant information to visitors. | This activity is in our legitimate interest to help ensure the website operates properly.
Where we have a contractual relationship with you, we may process your personal information as necessary for the performance of that contract or prior to entering into it.
What we do with your data
For our research, all data held internally is anonymised, apart from where the information on the individual is publicly available (i.e. Members of Parliament). When published, all results are anonymised and any personal information is retained internally.
Occasionally, where we partner with other organisations, we may share information with them (for example, if you register to attend an event being jointly organised by us and another charity). We’ll only share information when necessary and we will never share your contact information (e.g. email or telephone).
Where we keep it
Your data will be retained and stored confidentially and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act (1998) and General Data Protection Regulation (2018) principles.
Your data will be stored on The Sutton Trust’s shared drive. We are based in the UK and store our data within the EU.
We may use the following third-party service providers named below to process and store your data:
Mailchimp (The Rocket Science Group, LLC), which we use to manage email marketing subscriber lists and send emails to our subscribers. Read their privacy policy.
Google Analytics, which we use to measure the performance of this website. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. Search queries and results are also logged anonymously in Google Analytics to help us improve our website and search functionality. Read their privacy policy. You can opt-out of Google Analytics cookies altogether by opting-out of the browser add-on.

**      5.  How long we keep it**
The Trust will store information only for the purposes for which it was collected and continually review our retention periods to ensure that personal data is not stored unnecessarily.
Personal data associated with research will be stored for 10 years, unless it is still considered necessary for research purposes. For all our personal data we will perform an annual check to ensure that:
stakeholders are still working at the organisations and in relevant roles within those organisations to justify inclusion on our data-base;
media contacts are up to date and relevant;
personal data associated with research is up to date, and still needed for research purposes (for example we would retain information on individuals who still hold the prominent positions which our research examines, such as those who remain Members of Parliament, as this information would be vital for future analysis. However, if that individual is no longer an MP or a candidate for parliament, they would be deleted from our database).
If not, your personal information is deleted.
