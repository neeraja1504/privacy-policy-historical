1. Why, how and what personal information we collect about you
You can generally use parts of our Services or our website without giving us any personal information about you. However, most of our Services and parts of our website(services) are only accessible if you register a MEMBER account with SERVICE and complete and submit the information required for the registration process. For this purpose we may request you to provide us with personal information about you which may comprise your name, address, phone number and(or) email address, details of your visits to our Services or website or other information specifically required to offer our Services to you. We collect this information about you when you submit it through our Services or website, typically when you register your MEMBER account or when email us or correspond with us. Some of the personal information that we collect about you will be "Personal Data". This means information and data related to you and which may be used to identify you.

to register you and to enable you to use our Services or website;

We will delete your Personal Data once you inform us that you will no longer be using our Services unless and to the extent we are required to retain your Personal Data for legitimate reasons (e.g. due to legal requirements or if we still need your Personal Data to process the contractual relationship with you, such as billing or accounting) or if a deletion of your Personal Data would only be possible with unreasonable efforts, in which case we will lock your Personal Data instead of a deletion. We will not collect an excessive amount of Personal Data about you or any information that is not relevant to the purposes it was collected for.
