Privacy Principles
**
At Suncor, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal information of individuals with whom we interact, such as our customers, suppliers, neighbours, employees and contractors.
**
Collecting, Protecting and Using Information
**
When collecting personal information from individuals, we will explain how we intend to use it, we will collect only what we believe is reasonably necessary to meet those purposes, and we will not use or disclose it for other unrelated purposes without the person's consent, except in the limited circumstances prescribed by applicable law.
Upon inquiry, we will explain the options for, and consequences of, withholding or withdrawing consent, and will record and respect an individual's choices. Suncor may also collect from another party, such as a service provider or other organization, personal information from or about an individual, if the individual has provided his or her consent to the other party, allowing Suncor to collect and use the individual's personal information.
Our business processes will be designed and applied to appropriately safeguard personal information, considering the sensitivity and use of that information. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure information is as accurate and up-to-date as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. Once the information is no longer needed, it will be appropriately destroyed.
**
Sharing Information
**
We may provide an individual's personal information to other parties:
where we have the individual's consent
where required or permitted to by law
where the other parties are acting as our agent or as a service provider and have agreed to handle the information in accordance with this policy, or
where business mergers, divestments or acquisitions are involved.
We may collect personal information about an individual from other parties:
where we have the individual's consent
where required or permitted to by law
where the other parties are acting as our agent or service provider and have agreed to handle the information in accordance with this policy
where business mergers, divestments or acquisitions are involved, or
where the other party has obtained the individual's consent.
Access to Information
Individuals may request access to the information that Suncor has about them, may discuss Suncor's business practices regarding the use of the information, and may address concerns about how Suncor handles personal information by contacting Suncor's Privacy Officer (see contact information below).
We respect the concerns of individuals regarding information about them, and will respond to their concerns or complaints within a reasonable time frame and within the time frame required by law.
**
What is Personal Information?
**
Personal information is any factual or subjective information about an "identifiable individual." It can include:
name
home address
e-mail and phone number
resume information
age
purchases and spending habits
photos
credit card information
opinions
evaluations
comments.
Personal information does not include anything that might appear on business cards or that can be found through other publicly available information, such as a telephone directory. The legislation also does not cover personal information used strictly for personal purposes (such as personal greeting card lists) or for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.
**
Privacy While Using Suncor's Internet Sites
**
For technical evaluation and statistical purposes, Suncor employs per-session cookies on the company's web site. This mechanism collects the name of the individual's Internet Service Provider, IP (Internet protocol) address and server name, the length of each visit, the number of requests per visit, and the individual's operating system and browser type. No attempt is made to correlate these details with personal information that an individual submits voluntarily.
If web site users provide Suncor with personal information through Internet use or e-mail, the company will consider that consent to use this information for the purpose it has been provided has been granted to Suncor, its affiliates or agents. For example, resumes are used for employment purposes, and contact information may also be provided through credit application forms or through the subscribe feature if used to provide alerts of new information on the site as requested by the user. Once an individual unsubscribes, his or her identity is deleted from the alert list.
Suncor also scans Internet communications for system management and security purposes in order to detect malicious software and unauthorized access. Privacy and confidentiality are not guaranteed when using unencrypted Internet communications.
In some cases, Suncor uses third parties to process transactions that may include personal information. In such cases, we rely on contract terms and conditions with third parties to ensure they apply the same or higher standards concerning collection, use and disclosure as were identified in Suncor's privacy policy statement above. We may also pass relevant personal information to others where we are legally entitled or required to do so.
