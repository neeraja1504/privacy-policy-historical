Our application platforms, affiliates, analytics tools, service providers and select businesses that we have marketing relationships with use technology such as cookies, beacons, pixel tags and scripts.
Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the website's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current website activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about website traffic and website interaction so that we can offer better website experiences and tools in the future.
Web beacons (clear GIFs)/pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies and are a part of most web pages. These allow us and our third-party partners to identify the pages you visit and generate behavioral statistics in order to improve your experiences with our website and to make our marketing efforts for you more relevant.
In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third-party links on our website to provide you more relevant marketing and experience. They may automatically collect information about you through cookies, beacons and scripts for the purpose of serving you relevant content and marketing. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility, liability, nor does this policy cover for the content and activities of these linked websites. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you improved content and marketing, you may opt-out here or if you are located in the European Unions, opt-out here. Using these links does not opt you out of ads being served, you can still receive generic ads. To opt-out of third-party advertising or analytics, please see the "Your Choices" section of this policy.
We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our website visitors and those placing orders. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your website experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.
