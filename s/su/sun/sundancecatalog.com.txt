Security
Ordering from our site is as secure as ordering via a catalog or using your credit card at your favorite restaurant. The media has played a large role in accelerating the myth that online shopping subverts your personal information any more than shopping anywhere else. If you shop from trusted merchants with an established brand, your online experience should be worry free.
At Sundance we use SSL (Secure Socket Layering) 128 bit encryption to protect your information as it travels over the internet. We also hold a secure key, or digital certificate, through Digital Signature Trust. This key ensures that we are who we say we are and that any data exchanged online is protected from theft and tampering. Consumer protection laws protect you against any unauthorized use of your credit card. Federal law dictates that your legal liability is limited to $50 if your credit card number is used without your permission. If you suspect any illegal use of your card, call your issuing bank immediately to make sure your rights are protected.
We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.
