For trading purposes, we have the telephone number (+34) 931816896, and operate through the following website: www.suntransfers.com with email address info@suntransfers.com. For other local telephone numbers please refer to the “24H CONTACT” section of our website. For the purpose of providing our service, we work with Transport Operators who deliver a professional Transfer Service for transporting people, or act as an agency with capacity to offer transport services, holding the relevant licences and permits required by national law for this activity.
In no case shall the transport services be considered as package travel in the terms of Council Directive 90/314/EEC, of 13 June 1990, or in the terms of the Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007, of 16 November, approving the revised text of the General Law on the Protection of Consumers and Users and other supplementary laws, and therefore the Company shall in no way be considered a travel agency.
Through its websites, ST Services Iberia S.L. offers transport management services for individuals or groups.
Before requesting a service offered on our Website you should ensure that you have read and understood these Terms, as they will govern any subsequent Contract. By making a Booking, you confirm you have read these Terms and have the legal capacity to accept them on behalf of yourself and all the Passengers. If you do not understand any of the Contract conditions, we strongly recommend that you contact Customer Service before proceeding with any booking. If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms, regrettably you may not make a booking with us.
3. ONLINE BOOKING PROCEDURE
The person making the Booking must be at least 18 years of age and has the responsibility to follow the online booking process, ensure all the details provided are correct and complete and make full payment.
Upon entering into a contract with ST Services Iberia S.L. the Company will undertake the necessary formalities to organise the requested services.
The contract becomes legally binding only when you have received your transfer voucher by email. In the event of the Transport Operator being unable to provide the requested services, you will be informed and reimbursed the full amount by the same method as the payment was made, leaving us with no further liability to you.
You are required to acknowledge all notifications we make to you. However, in the event that you fail to acknowledge receipt of an email, the records that exist on our email server shall be considered as proof of reception.
The act of us sending you the confirmation of charges and payments made by you shall not be considered as binding you to any contract.
The Transfer Vouchers which must be presented to the Transport Operator should be printed out so that each Voucher is readily available for inspection by the driver. Failure by the Lead Passenger to present the Voucher may result in the Transfer Service not being provided. We recommend that you print out and carry with you all communications between the parties in addition to the Transfer Vouchers.
Minors are strictly prohibited from seeking any service from us, and their parents, legal guardians or other persons responsible for them should contact us immediately should a minor make a Booking with the Company for the provision of a service in order to enable us to cancel the registration forthwith. Minors are not allowed to travel with us without an adult passenger in their company.
4. PAYMENT
We accept all widely used payment methods including credit card (American Express, MasterCard/Diners International, Visa), debit card (Visa/Delta, Visa/Electron), bank transfer and PayPal. The use of PayPal is only possible for bookings exceeding a certain amount and the customer will be charged an admin fee.
Prices are charged in Euros and any currency conversion facility is provided as an approximation tool only.
5. CHANGES
The Transfer Voucher includes your requested destination / pickup and your accommodation address. Any changes to these or any other details must be sent in writing by email to info@suntransfers.com or requested through the “My Booking” section of the Website prior to the date of travel and will not take effect until checked with the Transport Operator and confirmed to you by email.
You are liable for any increased service cost resulting from requested change. The first change will be made free of charge, additional changes may incur a 15€ administration fee. Gold Cancellation Protection may be added to the arrival leg of an existing booking up to 48h before the date of the first transfer service. No refund is due for changes within less than 48 hours.
Once the contract becomes legally binding, the Customer is requested to notify our Customer Service Centre of any errors therein not less than 48 hours prior to the corresponding Transfer Service. Notification made within 48 hours of the corresponding Transfer Service affords us the right to terminate the Contract without penalty or charge.
6. CANCELLATIONS BY YOU
Any cancellation of Contract must be made in writing by fax or email addressed to our Customer Service Centre. You may cancel booked Transfer Services separately or cancel the whole Booking.
If we receive your cancellation request more than 48 hours before the scheduled pickup time of the Transfer Service you wish to cancel, the amount paid for this transfer will be refunded in full. No monies will be refunded for cancellations received less than 48 hours from the scheduled time of the Transfer Service you wish to cancel. In these instances we will email you a cancellation note which may be used to claim the expense back against your tour operator, airline, or travel insurance provider.
7. LAST MINUTE BOOKINGS
Depending on the routes and the season, our freesale deadline varies from 0 to 48 hours, and more in exceptional cases, before a Transfer Service commences. If prompted by the Website, please CONTACT US 24/7 so that we can check whether we have a suitable vehicle available for your transfer request. Please note that our cancellation policies will apply regardless of booking date and time.
8. CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS BY US
If the Transport Operator needs to make a significant change to the conditions of the Service, or needs to cancel the Service, we will inform you as soon as possible.
We will use reasonable effort to honour your vehicle preference, however the vehicle may be substituted with a vehicle of greater capacity or multiple vehicles depending on availability. If we need to change your booking to a lower category or smaller vehicle for which a lower rate is available, we will refund you the difference in the rates.
In rare instances we may need to cancel your Booking. In such circumstances you will be refunded in full but we shall have no further liability to you arising out of such cancellation. We will, however, use all reasonable efforts to try and find suitable alternatives for any confirmed Booking subsequently cancelled by us.
9. CHILD SEATS
Both local and national laws regarding the use of child seats for infants and children vary from country to country. However, all transfer operators will comply with the latest legislation. If you are booking a private transfer, we do recommend the use of booster or child seats for those under the age of 12, or up to 135cm, for safety purposes. During the booking process in most destinations you are given the chance to reserve child or baby seats.
The lead passenger must check, under his/her solely responsibility, that such child restraint devices are suitable for the vehicle and are properly used and installed in it. The company assumes no liability resulting from any failure to use, install, or check the restraint device, or resulting from its incorrect use.
If you wish to bring your own child or booster seat, and are taking a private transfer, we must be advised of this information before you travel. This is to ensure that the vehicle provided by the Transport Operator can accommodate the seat. Group services are usually provided by minibus or coach, and in these vehicles it is not possible to use a child seat as the vehicles do not have compatible seating.
We will endeavour to ensure that child seats are provided by our Transport Operators where they have been booked. There may be instances when such seats are unable to be provided. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund for seats booked and not supplied. If no child seat is available, children of three years of age and over may travel as long as they wear an adult seat belt. Children under three years of age may be transported without a safety restraint as long as they travel in the rear of the vehicle.
10. CHILD PRICING
All children and infants count towards the occupancy of the vehicle, regardless of age, and thus should be included in the total number of passengers at the time of booking.
11. WHEELCHAIRS AND BOOKINGS FOR DISABLED PASSENGERS
Transfer Services for disabled passengers must be requested by contacting our Customer Service Centre. We will try our best to meet your requirements, although we are not specialists in transfers for disabled passengers. Disabled passengers using our services must be able to board the vehicle independently or with the assistance of those in their party. We only take foldable wheelchairs. We regret that we cannot currently guarantee the type of vehicle that will be used for your transfer.
12. PRE-BOOKED EXTRA STOP
During the booking process you are given the opportunity to pre-book extra stops if you need to collect and drop off keys or if your group will be split between more than one accommodation address. The extra stop address must be located in the same destination as your principal accommodation address. Extra stop duration is limited to 5 minutes.
13. TRAVEL INSURANCE
We strongly recommend that you contract travel insurance which is adequate for your needs. Please read all the contract details and print the documentation so that you can take it with you when you travel. Comprehensive travel insurance will cover you for many eventualities that are beyond our control.
14. OUR LIABILITY
If we fail to comply with these Terms, we shall only be responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence and only up to the value of the fare paid by you. We will not be held responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable nor that is consequential. We are not liable for breaches that are not directly attributable to us, or those produced by accident, force majeure, or due to legal or administrative requirements.
We cannot be held liable for incidents that may occur during the provision of the service, more specifically illnesses, personal injuries or death, unless caused by our negligence.
This means that, subject to these Terms, we may accept responsibility if, for example, you suffer death or personal injury or your Transfer Service is not provided as promised or proves deficient as a result of the failure of ourselves, our employees, or Transfer Operators to use reasonable skill and care in making, performing or providing, as applicable, your contracted transport service. Please note, it is your responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make a claim against us.
In addition, we will only be responsible for what our employees and Transfer Operators do or do not do if they were at the time acting within the course of their employment (for employees) or carrying out work we had asked them to do (for Transfer Operators).
Nothing in these Terms and conditions excludes or limits: a. our liability to you for any death or personal injury resulting from our negligence b. any of your other statutory rights as a consumer that cannot be excluded or limited.
We are absolved of all liability whatsoever where the customer makes a contract for another service directly with the Transport Operator.
We cannot guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the content of this website. This includes such eventualities as viruses. However every endeavour will be made by us to rectify in the shortest possible period any errors to which our attention has been drawn. Should such errors result in Bookings being made against faulty pricing and promotional information, we reserve the right to terminate the contract without offering compensation to the customer.
15. FORCE MAJEURE
We accept no liability and will not pay any compensation where the performance of our obligations or the Transport Operator’s obligations is prevented or affected directly or indirectly by or as a result of force majeure or any circumstances beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, extreme adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, other acts of God, acts of terrorism, accidents suffered by third parties on the transfer route, police checkpoints, unusual traffic levels, or industrial action.
16. CONTACT
All contact related to the amendment of booking information must be requested by email or through the “My booking” section of our Website.
In the event of unavoidable alterations to the contract, we will inform you by emailing the address provided by you at the moment of booking, the act of sending this email being considered as proof of receipt by you. The same system applies to all other advisory emails which we may send to you. It is therefore essential that you check that the email address provided by you is correct and that you read any incoming emails up to the time of your Transfer Service.
In case your arrival transportation is delayed or diverted to a different airport, station or port, the Transport Operator will reschedule the Transfer Service and you will be picked up at the new arrival time subject to availability. In the case that there is no availability, you will be refunded in full. We apply IATA's definition of flight delays for the purposes of these Terms.
If for any other reason you fail to be at the pickup point within a reasonable time after the scheduled collection time specified on your Voucher, the Transport Operator or our Customer Service team will try to contact you on the mobile telephone number you have provided.
If it is not possible to speak to you because you have not provided an operational mobile telephone number at the time of booking, you have no or poor connection, no signal, activated voicemail or the call is unanswered, the service will not be provided, the Transport Operator is immediately relieved of their obligations and a refund will not be due.
17. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
We offer a range of services to which the Transport Operators have given their accord. These are private Transfer Services and shared or shuttle Transfer Services.
The route to or from the destination chosen cannot be guaranteed and the Google drawn route map displayed on our website is for informational purposes only. Whilst reasonable effort is made to ensure that pickup times are respected, they are not guaranteed.
In the event that you are unable to locate the driver of your private transfer or the representative of the shuttle Transport Operator, it is your responsibility to contact us on the 24/7 telephone numbers printed on your Transfer Voucher. If you fail to call these numbers and make alternative travel arrangements, we will be unable to provide the service, the Transport Operator will be relieved of their obligations and a refund will not be due. If your private transfer driver or the representative of the shuttle Transport Operator cannot locate you, a member of our Customer Service team will call the mobile phone number provided in the booking. Please ensure that you travel with this mobile phone and that it is switched on while you are waiting for your luggage or clearing customs. If we cannot locate you or reach you on the number provided, we will be unable to provide the service and a refund will not be due. For non-airport collections, we must receive your telephone call within 10 minutes of your scheduled pickup time. An electronic record of all calls received to the 24/7 numbers is kept by a third party telecoms provider, and shall be used as proof in the event of a dispute as to whether the numbers were called or not. Unused transfers are not refundable and alternative transport costs will not be reimbursed unless pre-authorised by a member of our team. If authorised to take alternative transport, please ensure that you obtain a receipt and submit it to our Customer Care team for review. No payment will be due for travel expense claims submitted without valid receipts.
You are responsible for checking the agreed pickup time and for ensuring that you arrive at the airport, station or port with enough time to check in or make any other preparations for your journey.
The Transport Operator will pick you up and set you down as close as possible to the given addresses. In the event that access via a conventional route is closed due to weather conditions, road accidents etc., the Transport Operator will, at your express request, use a longer route to reach the agreed destination, but in such instances you may be liable for any additional costs.
All contracted transfer services fall within the scope of the public liability cover of the Transport Operator’s insurance policy or that of their sub-contractor.
Whilst we endeavour to provide SMS confirmation messages when requested, this service is dependent upon telephone networks that are beyond our control. If a text message is lost or delayed the Customer shall refer to information provided by email or in the My Booking section of our Website.
18. BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE / CAPACITY
For shuttle transfers, each passenger has a luggage entitlement of 1x bag or suitcase per person, maximum combined size of 158cm (length + width + height) and hand luggage, such as handbags & small bags. All luggage must be securely labelled with the owner’s name and destination address. We cannot be held responsible for locating lost luggage that was not correctly labelled.
Private transfer vehicles have luggage capacity of at least 1x bag or suitcase per passenger seat based on a maximum combined size of 158cm (length + width + height) per item. All luggage must be declared at the time of booking. Smaller items that fit in the passenger footwell, such as a camera case, handbag or small shoulder bag, do not need to be declared. The Passenger shall be liable for all expenses incurred should additional vehicles be required to transport non-declared excess luggage.
Your acceptance of the proposed Contract and its Terms and conditions is considered as tacit agreement that under no circumstances will you include in your luggage, nor carry on your person, any object in contravention with the legislation of the country in which the transfers will be offered (firearms etc), nor those likely to be injurious to any third party, nor any items of excessive size, weight, fragility or perishability. Unless you are travelling with a guide dog / assistance dog, animals are not allowed.
Transport of luggage and other belongings is undertaken solely at your risk and under no circumstances can we be held responsible for any loss or damage. Such risk of loss or damage should be the object of private insurance taken out by you prior to departure.

What are cookies?
Cookies are files that may be downloaded to your device through web pages. They are essential tools to provide various information society services. This includes allowing a website to store and recover information on a user's or device’s browsing habits and, depending on the information obtained, using this information to recognise the user and improve the service offered.
Type of cookies
There are two types of cookies depending on which entity manages the domain from which the cookies are sent and handles the data:
First-party cookies: these are sent to the user’s terminal equipment from a machine or domain managed by the publisher who is providing the service requested by the user.
Third-party cookies: these are sent to the user’s terminal equipment from a machine or domain that is not managed by the publisher themselves, but rather by an entity that processes data obtained through cookies.
If cookies are installed from a machine or domain managed by the publisher themselves but the information collected through these is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered first-party cookies.
There is also a second classification depending on the period of time for which the cookies are stored in the client’s browser, either:
Session cookies: designed to collect and store data while the user is accessing the website. They tend to be used to store information that is only of interest to maintain the service requested by the user on a single occasion (e.g. a list of products purchased).
Persistent cookies: data is stored on the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a specific period defined by the party responsible for the cookie, ranging from a few minutes to several years.
Lastly, there is another classification with five types of cookies depending on the purpose for which the data obtained is processed:
Technical cookies: these allow the user to browse a web page, platform or application and use different options or services on those such as to control traffic and communication of data, identify the session, access restricted sections, record parts of an order, process purchase of an order, process registration or participation forms for an event, use security devices during browsing, store content to broadcast videos or audio, or share content through social media
Customisation cookies: these allow the user to access a service with certain general predefined characteristics depending on a series of criteria in the user terminal such as language, type of browser used to access the service, configuration for the region from which the service is accessed, etc.
Analysis cookies: these allow the party responsible for the cookies to track and analyse the behaviour of website users when enabled. The information collected through this type of cookies is used to measure activity on websites, applications or platforms and to prepare browsing profiles for the users of those sites, applications and platforms in order to develop improvements based on analysis of usage data from service users.
Advertising cookies: these are used to ensure the most efficient management of advertising spaces.
Advertising behavioural cookies: these store user behaviour information that is obtained by continuously observing their browsing habits. This helps develop a specific profile to display relevant advertising.
External social media cookies: these are used so that visitors can interact with the content via social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and are generated solely for users of this social media. The conditions for use of these cookies and the information gathered is covered in the privacy policy of the respective platform.
