OutServe-SLDN
OutServe-SLDN makes every attempt to protect the privacy of our web visitors.
OutServe-SLDN ("OUTSERVE-SLDN" or "we", "us", "our") shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of personal information we collect on the OUTSERVE-SLDN.org website (the "Site"). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern our collection and use of information off-line.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years old. If you are under 13 years old, please do not provide us with any such information.
Information that We Collect and Track
As further described below, we collect two types of information about Site visitors: (i) personal information that individual visitors provide when contributing to OUTSERVE-SLDN, or voluntarily at certain other points; and (ii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor.
Personal Information
We collect personal information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and credit card information, when you volunteer such information, for example when you complete our contribution form (the "Personal Information"). Wherever we collect Personal Information from you on the Site, we will make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
E-Mails to OUTSERVE-SLDN
If you e-mail us, we may keep a record of your correspondence, and you may receive one or more reply e-mails from us emanating from the OUTSERVE-SLDN.org domain. Please be aware that many e-mail applications retain a copy of all sent messages in a "Sent Items", "Outbox" or similar folder, thus it may be possible for others with access to such folders to view any e-mails you send us.
Action Alerts
You may subscribe to our Action Alert listserv by providing your e-mail address and, at your option, your first and last name, at the Action Alert subscription page.

You may unsubscribe to the Action Alert listserv at any time by visiting the Action Alert subscription page.

We collect Personal Information from you when you contribute to OUTSERVE-SLDN, including credit card information. Unless you elect otherwise when you submit such information, we may (i) include your name on donor and supporter lists.  Like most organizations, we also hire companies to provide certain administrative services that require access to member information, such as processing address labels, managing databases, and sending mailing.

Tracking Data
Tracking data consists of information we collect automatically from each Site visitor that is not associated with an identifiable individual. Such tracking data includes information such as the Site visitor's browser type, operating system, Internet service provider or referring site.
