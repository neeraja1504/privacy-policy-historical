We use a third-party payment processor to handle payment transactions. Any payments you make will be subject to their privacy notices.
2. Information We Automatically Collect from You When You Use the Services
Information collected through our cookies and web beacons. We (or service providers on our behalf) may use technologies, including “cookies” and “web beacons,” to collect automatically information from you when you use the Services. Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored within your Internet browser, which saves and recognizes your browsing habits. SL Trib uses both session cookies (which track a user’s progression during one site visit) and persistent cookies (which track a user over time). Web beacons are web page elements that can recognize certain types of information on your computer or mobile device, such as the time and date you viewed a page, which emails are opened, which links are clicked, and similar information.
Information that may be collected by cookies and web beacons when you use the Services may include, without limitation:
web pages you visit;
date and time of your visit to or use of the Services;
usage and activity data related to the Services;
websites you visit before or after visiting the Services;
browser type;
Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or mobile device to the Internet;
your computer or mobile device and connection information, such as your browser type and version, operating system, and platform; and
your device identifier.
You can delete cookie files from your hard drive, or avoid them altogether, by configuring your browser to reject them or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your hard drive. Not all features of the Services will function as intended if you reject cookies.
The information we collect automatically is statistical information and may include Personal Data, or we may maintain it or associate it with Personal Data we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. If you do not want us to collect this information, please do not use the Services.
Your Internet browser and mobile device may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites you visit. SL Trib respects your wishes and will not track user activity once “do not track” signals have been activated.
