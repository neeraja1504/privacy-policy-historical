Certain Cookies are essential so that you can move around the site and log in to your Account. Without them you would be unable to take certain actions on our website or access your account.
*  **Monitoring and improving the performance of the website:**
We may use Cookies to collect information about how visitors use the site, e.g. which pages they visit most often and whether they see error messages. The information is aggregated so it does not identify individuals, and we use it only to help us improve the way the website works.
*  **Enabling the features of the website:**
We may use Cookies that allow our website to remember choices you have made, such as your user name, and help us provide you with a better, more personal experience. For example, they may allow you to watch a video clip, comment on a blog or add a product review.
*  **Marketing and advertising:**
We may use Cookies to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you, as well as to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The Cookies remember that you have visited a website and this information may then be shared with other organisations for advertising purposes.
*  **What are ‘Flash Cookies’ (or ‘Local Shared Objects’)?**
If your browser does not support HTML5 player, we may deliver video content using Adobe Flash Player instead (although you may experience display problems if your browser is unsupported).  Flash Cookies are stored on your device in a similar way to other types of Cookie, but they're managed differently by your browser, and if you wish to disable or delete them you can do this through Adobe Flash Player security settings.
*  **Restricting or blocking Cookies**
As you will have seen in ‘How We Use Cookies’ above, some parts of our website need Cookies in order to function correctly. By default, Cookies should be enabled on your computer or device, and although you can ‘disable’ them in your browser this will affect your experience on the website. You will be limited to browsing, viewing and searching for products but may not be able to take additional actions on our site or log in to your account.
If you'd still prefer to restrict, block or delete Cookies from this or any other website, you may do so in your internet browser. Each browser is different, so you’ll need to go to the 'help' menu on your browser and look for how to change your ‘Cookie preferences’.  The website www.aboutcookies.org contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers.
*  **Disabling advertising Cookies**
We may engage third party advertisers to provide interest-based advertising on our website, as well as other third party sites in order to display advertising that is relevant to you. These third parties may collect information about your use of our services over time and that information may be combined with information collected on different websites and online services.

We may still collect information about you for any purpose permitted under the Policy, including for analytics.
*  ** **Google Analytics  ****
