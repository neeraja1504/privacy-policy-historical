Privacy policy - Slice the pie
Effective May 25, 2018
The Privacy Policy describes how Slicethepie Limited (“Slicethepie”) processes Personal Data in the context of online panel communities, surveys, reward programs, websites and mobile applications (collectively the “Service”). In particular, it describes the types of Personal Data we collect in connection with the Service, the purposes for which we collect that Personal Data, the other parties with whom we may share it, and the measures we take to protect the security of the data. It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal Data, and how you can contact us to update your contact information or ask questions about our privacy practices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your Personal Data in the context of surveys administered by third parties. In these situations, Slicethepie is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data are and will be controlled by the sponsor of the survey. Please refer to the relevant sponsor’s privacy policy to learn more about that sponsor’s privacy practices.
Registration with, use of, and access to the Service is subject to this Privacy Policy and our  Terms and conditions.

e. Personal Data We Process in relation to Survey about Clients’ Advertising
When you use the Service to participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Slicethepie is testing for its business clients, you may see these ads or promotions in several places, including in non-Slicethepie mobile apps (e.g., in a gaming app). Once you have been exposed to the relevant ads and promotions, Slicethepie will provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about these ads or promotions and/or may provide certain demographic data about you to the advertiser or the advertiser’s agent regarding the demographic profiles of individuals who have viewed the ad.
To facilitate the completion of such surveys on ads or promotions, Slicethepie has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including in other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and other information collected via automated means. Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Slicethepie is measuring for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Slicethepie that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Slicethepie to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion.
