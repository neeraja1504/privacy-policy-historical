SlideRoom - Privacy Policy
SlideRoom Technologies Inc. (“Company”) is a business to business service provider providing applicant tracking systems (ATS) to almost one thousand institutional customers across university admissions, HR, grants, and other important areas. As such we hand all personal data as a data processor, and follow the directions of our client, who remains the data controller.
This statement applies with respect to the information that we collect from the Product Website at http://www.SlideRoom.com and Accounts provided to our Clients and their applicants. Amendments to this statement will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof.
I. INFORMATION COLLECTED
We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to provide your name, address, email, and phone number and other personally identifiable items defined by each SlideRoom customer you elect to submit an application to, in order to fulfill your application requirements. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a SlideRoom-hosted application or registration form.
II. USE OF INFORMATION
We will only use the information you provide to us for the purpose for which such information was provided. We may also use this information to deliver to you information about our company and site administration. If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data. SlideRoom is a data processor and as such works with the data controller, to ensure security and privacy for all SlideRoom users. If you ever submit a payment through SlideRoom, please note that SlideRoom does not directly process or store your financial account information – instead, we use a reputable third party company to collect and process your payment information. Rest assured, however, that we have taken steps to ensure that the Payment Processing Company protects personal information it collects from you in compliance with our Privacy Policy.
III. USE OF IP ADDRESS
We use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website.
IV. USE OF COOKIES
When you view our Website we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive nor steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a Website as easily as possible. We use cookies to store that users are logged in and to gather aggregate information via Google Analytics.
SlideRoom uses third party vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including the Google Adwords tracking cookie. Third party vendors will place cookies on web browsers in order to serve ads based on past website visits or engagement with our content. These cookies may be used to show ads to you across the Internet. As always we respect your privacy and are not collecting any personally identifiable information through the use of any third party remarketing system. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting your Google Ad Settings.
V. SECURITY
SlideRoom uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, disclosure, and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all commercially reasonable steps to secure your personal information.
To protect your SlideRoom account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your SlideRoom account. Try not to reuse your SlideRoom account password on any other application or website.
If you enter your password in an external website and it's compromised, someone could try to sign in to your SlideRoom account with the same information. Don't write it down, send it via email, or tell anyone. SlideRoom will never email you to ask for your password or other sensitive information.
If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or SlideRoom account, please contact SlideRoom at support@slideroom.com immediately.
VI. ONWARD TRANSFER
SlideRoom may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, SlideRoom is liable unless we can prove we were not a party giving rise to the damages.
SlideRoom will only disclose your personal information with the organization that you are applying to, whom you purposefully select to submit that information to. Whenever your application is submitted to third party, that organization and only that organization will be able to view all information associated with your SlideRoom account, as well as all information included in your surveys, applications, or forms you submit to that organization.
If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with any third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data.
VII. EU DATA PROTECTION
SlideRoom complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. SlideRoom has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
