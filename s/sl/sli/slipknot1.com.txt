Welcome to Vixlet ("we," "us" or "our"). Vixlet provides a unique and fun way for you to share and discover media around passions and to connect and interact with individuals who share similar passions through the Vixlet World. The Vixlet World also includes Vixlet Branded Worlds, which are communities that are devoted to a shared passion for brands, co-branded by Vixlet and such brand (a "Vixlet Partner"),powered by Vixlet’s Service. Vixlet Branded Worlds do not include any applications or websites not powered by Vixlet Service.
1.Information We Collect and How We Use It

Account Creation. We may use your first and last name, email address, birthday, hometown (city and state only), VIXLET Username and password to create your Vixlet account. In the event that you’re creating a Vixlet account in a Vixlet Branded World of which the Vixlet Partner also has other websites and applications of which you do not have an account with, a log in will be created for you with those non-Vixet branded web sites or applications of the Vixlet Partner.

The shared login allows the Vixlet Service to connect and share profile information with the Vixlet Partner’s other web sites and applications.

This End User Passed Data may include, but not be limited to, your name, email address, postal address, and demographic information such as age and gender.

If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Vixlet will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Vixlet.
If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that our Privacy Policy will govern any information that such service may provide to us.

You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your third party personal account, Vixlet does not have access to or control this communication.
Location data. Certain VIXLET Service will become available based on where you are. If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with location-based Service, such as the unlocking of certain Capsules. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can deactivate GPS on your mobile device. Please refer to your device manufacturer for instructions on how to do this.
Log data. We automatically store information related to your use of the Vixlet World, such as the pages you view on the Vixlet World, your browser type, IP address, requested URL, browser language, referring URL, and the date and time of your visit. We use this type of information to administer the Vixlet World and provide the highest possible level of service to you. We also use this information in the aggregate (without Personal Information) to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Vixlet World.
Device Information. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." We may use this data to help detect unauthorized access to your Vixlet account. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Vixlet. A device identifier may deliver information to us about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Metadata. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Submission (as defined in our Terms of Service). This makes your User Submsision more searchable by others and more interactive. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Submission was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Submission including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
Cookies. We send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely indentify your browser and improve the quality of our service. "Cookies" refer to small pieces of information that the Vixlet World sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the Vixlet World. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Vixlet World may not work properly or at all. Our cookies are linked to your account information. We have no access to or control over the use of these cookies. These cookies collect information about your use of the Vixlet World, such as where you came from, which pages you visited within the Vixlet World, and possibly other Vixlet Worlds you visit if those websites cooperate with the same third party, but do not collect your name, email address, contact information or other personally identifiable information that by itself would allow the third party to identify or contact you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices or computer, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.
GIFs. Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a website. The use of a clear GIF allows the website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear GIF. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. Clear GIFs, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Clear GIF, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Clear GIF was viewed.
Feedback. You should feel free to give us feedback, register a complaint, or ask questions about the Vixlet World. We may store your communications, including any personal information you include in them, so that we can effectively respond to you.
