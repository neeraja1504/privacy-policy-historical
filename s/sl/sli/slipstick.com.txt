Privacy Policy for Slipstick Systems Outlook and Exchange Solutions Center
Our privacy policy at the Slipstick Systems Outlook & Exchange Solutions Center is based on two simple principles:
Visitors deserve maximum access to information without the need to provide any kind of personal identification. This is why we do not ask you to log on and why our feedback and other forms that collect information don't require you to give your name.
As a professionally run site, we need to track certain aggregate information about site visitors to report to the sponsors who financially support the site and to help us understand how you, our visitors, are using the site.
Information We Collect Directly from You
On the Slipstick Systems Outlook and Exchange Solutions Center Feedback page and other pages that ask you to fill out a form, you may give as much or as little information as you choose. The more information you provide, the better we can serve you. For example, we cannot respond directly to your feedback form comments unless you provide an email address.
Any such personally identifying information is kept in strictest confidence by CDOLive LLC, the parent company of Slipstick Systems Outlook & Exchange Solutions Center. We will not provide it to any other party and will use it only for the specific purpose explained on the page where you submit your information.
Exchange Messaging Outlook Mailing List
The mailing list for our Exchange Messaging Outlook newsletter is hosted at LSoft.com. Click  here to subscribe. We do not rent that mailing list to third parties.
Information Collected in the Aggregate
We enjoy checking our statistics to learn more about how people are using the site. We also track statistics related to advertising on the site. Individual visitors remain anonymous. The data we collect is available only in the aggregate, never connected it with any individual site visitor.
Banner ads and clicks on certain links are monitored for our sponsors by the AdRunner service.
Affiliate Programs
In addition, we participate in several affiliate programs that track clicks on specific links so that any purchases you make at affiliated sites may be credited to us, thus producing a modest (very modest) revenue stream that helps us maintain the site. We do not have any control over the privacy policy at those sites or at any of the hundreds of other third-party sites that you can reach through the links on our pages. However, as far as we know, they collect no personal data other than information you provide when you make a purchase.
