Privacy Policy - SF Station - San Francisco City Guide
This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs the use and collection of information from you by SF Station’s products, software, services and websites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other information you may provide us through other means (e.g., via mail, via telephone or at a live event).
This SF Station Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through our Services. This includes “Personal Information,” which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, email address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as “Anonymous Information,” which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
By accessing or otherwise using the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and forms a part of the SF Station Terms of Service. You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.
Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Your Personal Information will not, however, be used or disclosed for purposes for which you have not given consent or which are not permitted under applicable law.
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information permanently from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet. By using the Services, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have a parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services.

We do not associate Traffic Data with records containing personal information and cannot use Traffic Data to retrieve personal information from your computer.
