This privacy policy (the " Privacy Policy ") governs information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of the SFMOMA Website and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information.
The Information SFMOMA Collects
User Provided Information: You may provide to SFMOMA what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, postal mailing address, email address, personal/business/mobile telephone number, billing information, and resume/CV) when you register on the SFMOMA Website or through services such as onsite touch-screen kiosks. In addition, SFMOMA may give you the option to provide us with certain demographic and preference information about yourself.
**"Cookies" Information:  ** When you visit the SFMOMA Website, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer.  The use of cookies is common practice and SFMOMA may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the SFMOMA Website. These persistent types of cookies can be removed.  Each web browser implements different functionality, so please refer to the manuals or technical support resources that are available in conjunction with your web browser to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up.  Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the resources and functionality available via the SFMOMA Website.
"Automatically Collected" Information : When you visit the SFMOMA Website or open one of our emails, we may use different types of technology to record certain information from your web browser.  This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the SFMOMA Website, the pages you view on our website, and the dates and times that you visit.
The Way SFMOMA Uses Information
SFMOMA uses the information that we collect to provide various features and services to our Users, members, and visitors.
SFMOMA may use all of the information that we collect from our Users to understand usage trends and preferences, to improve the way the SFMOMA Website and SFMOMA apps work and look, to improve our promotional efforts, membership drives, and fundraising efforts, and to create new features and functionality.
SFMOMA may use automatically collected information and cookies information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the SFMOMA Website; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our promotional efforts, membership drives, and fundraising efforts; and (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
SFMOMA will use information you provide through the SFMOMA Website, such as your email address or other personally identifiable information: (a) without further consent, for non-promotional or administrative purposes such as notifying you of major website updates, and (b) to send promotional, fundraising, and membership-related communications to you unless you opt-out of receiving such communications.
You may request that SFMOMA delete your personal information by contacting us as directed below.
When SFMOMA Discloses Information
SFMOMA may disclose both personally identifiable and automatically collected information to third party businesses, organizations, or persons to process such information on our behalf, to provide website maintenance and security, to provide various features and services to our Users, members, and visitors (including without limitation to enable sending of promotional, fundraising, and membership-related communications), to assist us in improving the way the SFMOMA Website works and looks, and to create new features.
We may share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, promotions, and/or functionality on the SFMOMA Website.
Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, SFMOMA does not share personal information about Users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a User’s request, or unless it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or in SFMOMA's interest in order to protect its property and other legal rights or the property and rights of others.
We do not share personally identifiable information with third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use: (a) unless we obtain your prior consent, or (b) as part of specific programs or features for which you will have the ability to opt-out.  By way of example, and without limitation, one such program may include sharing your information with other Bay Area cultural organizations through list exchanges designed to pair patrons with organizations whose work might interest them.
Please see the section entitled “Third Party Service Providers” below which addresses collection and use of your information by third parties (rather than by SFMOMA) to whom you may be redirected from the SFMOMA Website.
You may request that SFMOMA delete your personal information by contacting us as directed below.
Third Party Service Providers
The SFMOMA Website may contain links to other websites, products, or services that SFMOMA does not own or operate.  For example, we may partner with third party service providers to provide our Users with certain functionality or features (e.g. Museumtix for online ticket sales).  At times, websites hosted by these third party service providers, or other partners, may appear as if you are still on the SFMOMA Website.  To tell whether you are on the SFMOMA Website or viewing third-party content, simply check the address of the page in your browser's address window.
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every third-party website and service before providing any personally identifiable information to its operators.  Some of these third parties may share or sell the information that they collect from you.  SFMOMA is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.  If you choose to visit or use any third-party products, websites, or services, including those offered by our third party service providers or other partners, please be aware that this Privacy Policy will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using third-party products or services or otherwise interacting with any third parties.
