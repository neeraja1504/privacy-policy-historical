External Link Disclaimer
External links are provided as a convenience and for informational purposes only. An external link does not constitute an endorsement or an approval by the SFMTA of any of the products, services or opinions found on the external site. The SFMTA bears no responsibility for the accuracy, legality or content of the external site or for that of subsequent links. Contact the external site for answers to questions regarding its content.

Accessibility Policy
It is the policy of the SFMTA that information and services on its website be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities. It is the responsibility of the agency and its web page developers to become familiar with the guidelines for achieving universal accessibility and to apply these principles in designing and creating any official City and County of San Francisco website.
According to the latest statistics available from the Bureau of the Census, there are 9.7 million people in the United States who have difficulty seeing the words and letters in ordinary newsprint, equal to 5.0% of the total population. Another 10.9 million people, or nearly 6% of the total population, have difficulty hearing what is said in an ordinary conversation with another person.
The use of the City and County of San Francisco accessibility guidelines will ensure that websites created by agencies of City and County are developed to serve the largest possible audience. Compliance with these guidelines provides an added benefit to those users with text-based browsers, low-end processors, slow modem connections and/or no multi-media capabilities on their computer.

External Linking Policy
Purpose and Disclaimer
The SFMTA permits the establishment of external hyperlinks on its official website only if the links strictly comply with this policy. In establishing and maintaining its official website, the SFMTA does not intend to create any forum or other means for public discourse. Rather, the sole and limited purpose of the permitted external links is to provide information about the SFMTA for residents, businesses and visitors. The SFMTA does not endorse or provide preferential treatment to any third party websites or associated organizations or persons. Additionally, the SFMTA does not control third party sites and therefore does not warrant that third party sites are accurate or, reliable, or that they have operational links.
Linking Criteria
Consistent with the foregoing purpose, it is the SFMTA's policy to limit external links to the following:
a) Other governmental agencies;
b) Entities with which the SFMTA has an existing formal, contractual relationship;
c) Entities or events that receive funding from the City or are otherwise sponsored by the City to provide transportation related services or information or adminstration related web services;
d) Applications that use datasets from DataSF.org;
e) the City's Chamber of Commerce and the San Francisco Travel Association; and
f) Webpages that provide free access to traffic and weather information for San Francisco. Sales of SFMTA or other public transit fare media does not qualify as such a service unless you are selling SFMTA fare media online under a written contract with the SFMTA.
In addition, the SFMTA reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to:
a) Deny a link that does not meet the criteria set forth in this policy;
b) Deny or discontinue an external link at any time if the website provides or promotes false, slanderous, illegal, infringing or incorrect information;
c) Deny or discontinue an external link at any time if a substantial purpose of the linked website is to support or oppose a candidate or ballot measure;
d) Remove any external link if the nature of the organization to which the link relates no longer complies with the SFMTA's external link policy;
e) Revise this policy without prior notice when the SFMTA considers such revision to be in its best interests. We do not engage in link exchanges, the practice of linking to a site solely because it links to our site.
