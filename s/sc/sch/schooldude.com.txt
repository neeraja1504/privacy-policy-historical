Websites and/or online applications and services that are collecting information from children under the age of 13 are required to comply with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our Platform is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and no one under age 13 may provide any information to this Platform.

Users Outside of the United States
Our Platform is hosted in the United States and our services are provided from the United States. It is possible that certain information will be stored on servers in multiple other countries on the "cloud" or other similar distributed hosting platforms. If you are a user accessing our Platform or services from the European Union, Asia or any other region with laws governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your Personal Information outside your home jurisdiction, and that by providing your Personal Information you are consenting to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States and other jurisdictions as indicated above, and to our use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.
Data Security
We have developed and implemented a security assurance program using privacy and data protection best practices to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information that you provide to us is stored on our physically secure servers protected by firewalls and logical access controls. Sensitive credentialing and authentication information is encrypted and hashed in storage. All public network communication with our Platform is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. When we have given you (or when you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. You are responsible for compliance with our privacy and security recommendations. We are not responsible for your circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Platform.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we have implemented security measures that we think are adequate, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Platform. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Platform.
Mobile Device Management
If Technology Essentials MDM (mobile device management) application is installed on your device, it will enable your organization to enforce and periodically report on your device's configuration to ensure alignment with your organization’s security policies, procedures and standards.
We respect your privacy, and Technology Essentials MDM cannot access your personal application data, your call history, your voicemail or your SMS messages on your mobile device. We cannot and do not collect your personal data via Technology Essentials MDM. Here's what information is collected by Technology Essentials MDM and why: (a) device and network ID, and information on storage capacity, operating system, carrier, and firmware (to uniquely identify your device and to ensure that we're looking at the correct records if it’s lost or stolen), (b) list of apps installed by Technology Essentials MDM (needed to confirm whether apps provided by your organization have been installed), and (c) jailbreak or root detection (indicates whether built-in security features have been bypassed).
Permissions included within Technology Essentials MDM are critical in order to allow the DSI Device Policy Controller to perform the necessary administrative functions required within the context of an EMM/MDM admin app. These administration functions include, but are not limited to, adding and removing accounts, applying and enforcing device policies, implementing application restrictions, imposing constant device compliance with defined policies, and remotely erasing your organization’s data if you lose your device.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We post all changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting our Platform and this privacy policy to check for any changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are committed to security and the protection of your Personal Information and we will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of your Personal Information collected in the past without your consent.
