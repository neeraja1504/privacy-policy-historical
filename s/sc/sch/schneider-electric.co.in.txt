0. Changes to this Privacy Statement
Schneider Electric may modify this Privacy Statement as needed. This Privacy Statement has evolved since its last update of 13 May 2013.
Schneider Electric reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement as needed, for example, to comply with evolutions in laws, regulations, Schneider Electric practices and procedures, or requests by supervisory authorities.
In this case, Schneider Electric will inform individuals of Schneider Electric who are impacted of material changes in this Privacy Statement. Schneider Electric will post new versions on relevant internal and external websites.
The main changes and reasons for changes between the current version of this Privacy Statement and the previous version of 13 May 2013 are the following:
- a new presentation as a layered privacy statement, in order to make it easier to read
- wording improvements
- consistent wording across Schneider Electric websites
- specify our data processing and data sharing activities and the types of information processed for improved clarity
- changes to address new regulatory requirements resulting from the GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation).
1.Why this Privacy Statement?
Schneider Electric is committed to protecting your privacy and your personal information. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of how your personal information is protected. You should read it before accessing Schneider Electric digital content.
Schneider Electric strongly supports the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection as well as compliance with national and international privacy laws.
This Privacy Statement describes how Schneider Electric processes and protects the personal information of individuals who use our websites and other digital content as well as in the context of our offline business activities.
Schneider Electric has adopted an internal Global Data Privacy Policy which is applicable to all our subsidiaries for the collection, processing, use, dissemination, transfer, and storage of personal information. It imposes common rules for all of our subsidiaries of all countries, and aims at ensuring a high level of protection of personal information within Schneider Electric.
Schneider Electric has also established this Privacy Statement as an external publication of our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”), approved by data protection supervisory authorities of the European Union in November 2012 for the processing of personal information from the EEA as a data controller. In Schneider Electric’s Binding Corporate Rules, we respect and take into account the major principles of EU data protection rules as our Head Office is located in the European Union.
2. What is the Scope of this Privacy Statement? Who Is in Charge of Data Processing?
This Privacy Statement applies to all Schneider Electric subsidiaries and digital content, unless a specific privacy statement or privacy notice has been released to supplement it or to replace it. You should check the privacy statements made available to you on all digital content.
Schneider Electric is a global company with legal entities, business processes, management organisations, and a system infrastructure that crosses borders. This Privacy Statement applies to all Schneider Electric data processing activities run by our wholly owned subsidiaries, including product and service offerings and digital content (e.g. websites, applications, tutorials, e-training, newsletters, advertising, communication). However, it may be supplemented by a more specific privacy notice/statement/policy (“statement”) or even superseded by another statement specific to a particular Schneider Electric programme, product, service, content or entity. It is important that you read the statements made available to you for your full information.
The data controllers of the data processing activities are the Schneider Electric subsidiaries who have determined the data processing means and purposes. They may vary on a case by case basis. In many instances, the Head Office of Schneider Electric, Schneider Electric Industries SAS, 35 rue Joseph Monier 92500 Rueil Malmaison- France, is the data controller of global data processing activities, including the www.schneider-electric.com website.
This Privacy Statement binds all Schneider Electric wholly owned subsidiaries and their employees.
Any order made by you online is also subject to the terms and conditions provided on the relevant sites. You must read them.
3. Why Do We Collect and Use Personal Information?
We use your personal information for various purposes including to fulfil your orders and requests, to manage our relationship, conduct surveys, improve our products, services, online content as well as your user journey, manage your account and the programmes you join, analyse the activities on our websites, run our marketing activities, provide you with contextual and targeted advertising, ensure the security of our activities, protect against fraud and, more generally, run our business activities.
Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide our customers and other users with superior service and a smooth, efficient and personalised experience while using our digital content.
Schneider Electric collects personal information for the following purposes:
- To fulfil orders of products, services and digital content. We collect this information to deliver your order, to obtain payment, to communicate with you about the status of your order and for contract management purposes.
- To process job applications from candidates.
- To address your requests for information. If you contact us, we keep a record of your correspondence or comments, including personal information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to help us provide you better service in the event you contact us again.
- To provide you with the technical support you request from us. Personal information is necessary to identify your systems, understand the configuration of the products, diagnose your questions, and provide solutions.
- For relationship management purposes. It includes communicating with you about the products, services and digital content you have acquired to ensure you use them in the best way possible, including via emails and newsletters. For instance, location data may be used to suggest sources of products or support near you.
- To conduct surveys and polls. We collect personal information from individuals who volunteer to complete surveys or participate in polls. We use this information to get to know you better, measure satisfaction and improve our products, services and digital content.
- To improve our products, services and digital content; for instance we analyse the use of our applications and sites in order to identify areas and functionalities where users have difficulties and we redesign them.
- To learn about your browsing and searching activity. We collect certain personal information when you visit our digital content or click on links for products and services. We collect this information to improve your user experience for your next visits (e.g., country selection or profile-focused content), help the sites run more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information to analyse the sites’ activity and performance, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising. We may use cookies and other identifiers or similar technologies (referred to hereinafter as "Cookies") to obtain information on the referring website, type of browser used, the content viewed as well as the date and time of your access to the digital content. You may read our Cookie Notice for more information on our use of Cookies and your options for managing Cookies (see our Cookie Notice).
- To manage your account. When you register, we use your personal information to give you access to digital content and our services, authenticate you and interact with you about it.
- To run our promotional programmes and activities: we collect personal information from you when you join a promotional or reward programme or activity. We use this information to administer the programme or activity, to send you relevant emails about the programme and activity, notify winners, and make the winners' list publicly available in accordance with applicable regulations and laws.
- For us (including our subsidiaries) and selected third parties to send you marketing information by mail, fax, phone, text messages, email and electronic communications about promotions, news and new products or services that we think may be of interest to you in compliance with applicable opt-in and opt-out requirements.
- To provide you, through pop-ups, banners, video, emails and any other advertising format, with certain communications and/or targeted advertising about our products and services (or of our subsidiaries). For instance::
• we may provide you with contextual advertising or other content, based on the content of the visited webpage or other information we have about you, when you navigate through our digital content;
• we may collect information on your use of the digital content and the services through the use of Cookies to provide you with targeted advertising through emails, or banners/pop-ups or other format when you visit:
• the digital content; and also
• third-party websites or apps that have no link to our digital content. The advertising on these third-party websites may include advertising about Schneider Electric.
We may, for instance, use location data to inform you about local promotions and activities. Please read our Cookie Notice for more information on the use of Cookies and your options for managing them.
- To combine information obtained online and the information we collected about you offline to create a profile of you that we may use for giving you personalised services. For example, a user that we believe is an electrician (due notably to information provided at the time of registration and other information obtained from third-party sources), may see electric utilities-related advertising in the digital content and/or on third-party websites and apps that a user with another energy-related specialty would not see. Similarly, users may see different content on the digital content or receive different emails containing different advertisements or surveys. We may also use Cookies to geographically target users.
- To ensure the security of our products, services and digital content of our activities and of others, for the protection against fraud and the compliance with our terms and conditions and this Privacy Statement. We may also investigate potential breaches.
- To enable or administer our business, such as for quality control and consolidated reporting.

10. Important Information for Individuals in the EEA
If you are located in the EEA, Schneider Electric also complies with GDPR specific requirements including those relating to legal grounds for processing, cross border data transfers, automated decision making and profiling, data retention, additional rights, claims and DPO contact details.
10.1 What Legal Grounds is Schneider Electric Relying on to Use Personal Information?
The use of personal information is necessary, with respect to the purposes mentioned in section 3 above, to, respectively:
• Perform the contract entered into between Schneider Electric and you in the context of the use of our products, services or digital content. The performance of the contract includes knowing who you are, and your specialty and interacting with you for its performance. It also includes addressing your requests for information, support, your job applications, managing your accounts and your enrolment into our programmes and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions and with this Privacy Statement.
• Comply with legal obligations to which we are subject. For instance mandatory tax and accounting obligations or addressing filing obligations and requests by competent regulatory bodies and authorities.
• When it comes to:
• Surveys, some are carried out in our legitimate interest because they are to measure your satisfaction with services you requested from us. For other surveys we will request your consent. You will always be free not to respond.
• Providing you with marketing communications and interest-based advertising, these activities carried out by us and by our subsidiaries are in our legitimate interests. We will always provide you a possibility to opt out and we will seek your prior consent, where required by applicable law.
• Using location data transmitted by your mobile device, we will seek your prior consent, where required by applicable law.
We may also process your personal information for the purposes of our legitimate interests provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms, in particular to:

10.2 Will Personal Information Be Transferred Abroad?
Schneider Electric being a global Company, the teams working on fulfilling data processing purposes may have global or multi-country roles. They can then be located anywhere in the world where Schneider Electric operates, including outside the European Union, in countries which do not have equivalent standards for the protection of personal information as in the country where you are located. We may also transfer data to service providers located outside of the EU, including in the United States of America. In the event that these data transfers cannot claim an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Schneider Electric will ensure that they comply with applicable legal requirements, for example, by executing standard contractual clauses or through its Binding Corporate Rules for intragroup transfers as a data controller. To obtain more details on these transfers and, where appropriate, copies of the applicable safeguards put into place, you may contact:   Global-Data-Privacy@schneider-electric.com
10.3 Do We use Profiling and Make Automated Decisions About You?
We may use profiling to provide you with online content which we believe corresponds to your interests. We combine registration information, such as your work specialty and information about your online activity (i.e. the content you seem to enjoy most) to know you better and provide you with online content corresponding to your profile.
We will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology. In this case, due notice will be provided. - The duration of our relationship (e.g. contract performance duration, account de-activation, your legitimate need to be recognized when you contact us) - Legal requirements for keeping data - Statute of limitations
10.4 How Long Will Personal Information Be Retained?
We will retain your personal information for as long as the information is needed for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law. More precise information is provided in privacy notices applicable to specific digital content. In general, data retention periods are determined taking into consideration:
• The duration of our relationship (e.g. contract performance duration, account de-activation, your legitimate need to be recognised when you contact us)
• Legal requirements for keeping data
• Statute of limitations
We keep relevant customers' data for three years after the end of the contract or the last contact for marketing purposes, and contact data for three years after the last contact for the same purposes.
10.5 What Are Your Additional Rights?
In addition to the rights provided in section 9 above, you may ask us to erase, restrict or port your personal information and object to the use of your personal information. When data processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by sending a request to the following email address: Global-Data-Privacy@schneider-electric.com. For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on legitimate interest, we may not be able to accommodate your request to stop the processing, or if we do so, it may mean that you can no longer access the services or the online content.
