SchoolCity

Privacy
Policy
This
Privacy
Policy
governs
the
manner
in
which
SchoolCity
Inc.
collects,
uses,
maintains
and
discloses
information
collected
from
users
(each,
a
"User")
of
The
STARS™
web
application
("Site").
This
privacy
policy
applies
to
the
Site
and
all
products
and
services
offered
by
SchoolCity

Web
browser
cookies
A
cookie
is
a
text
file
that
lives
on
the
client
user's
computer.
Cookies
are
either
stored
in
memory
(session
cookies)
or
placed
on
users'
hard
disk
(persistent
cookies).
A
persistent
cookie
can
keep
information
in
the
user's
browser
to
a
long
lifespan
until
deleted.
Our
Site
only
uses
session
cookies.
When
an
authenticated
user
logs
off,
cookies
are
emptied.
Sensitive
information,
including
user
credentials,
is
not
stored
in
cookies.
Users
may
determine
how
their
browser
handles
cookies,
and
may
disable
cookies
being
stored.
However,
by
disabling
cookies
certain
Site
features
and
functionality
may
no
longer
work
properly,
or
function
at
all.
Authentication
The
Site
requires
user
authentication.
Authentication
may
be
based
on
the
existence
of
an
entry
in
the
Customer’s
LDAP
directory
or
on
the
presence
of
application-­‐specific
credentials
stored
in
the
Site
database.
The
purpose
of
authentication
is
to
control
access
to
protected
data
and
restrict
actions
that
may
be
performed.
Once
a
user
has
been
authenticated,
a
unique
internal
user
ID
is
stored,
usually
in
session
but
possibly
in
cookies
(see
the
sections
on
Cookies
and
Session).
This
ID
is
stored
only
as
long
as
the
user
session
is
valid.
This
unique
internal
user
ID
is
based
on
internal
database
record
keys
and
is
not
related
in
any
way
to
any
other
identification
owned
by
or
assigned
to
the
user.
The
stored
internal
user
ID
may
be
used
to
track
a
user's
actions
while
logged
in
to
the
application:
•       Stored
internal
user
IDs
are
used
to
ensure
that
users
only
visit
data
they
are
allowed
to
see.
•       The
internal
user
ID
of
an
authenticated
user
may
be
logged
when
an
error
occurs
during
that
user's
session.
•       The
internal
user
ID
of
an
authenticated
user
may
be
logged
in
a
log
tracking
session
activities.
•       Other
user
information,
such
as
name,
may
also
be
stored
in
session
to
be
used
as
above
or
to
provide
a
customized
user
interface.
A
user's
password
is
not
stored
in
session
or
in
cookies.
Once
the
user
has
logged
off,
all
user
information
stored
outside
of
the
authentication
source
is
deleted.
Access
Logs

a
user
is
