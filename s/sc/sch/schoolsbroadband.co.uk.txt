Privacy Policy
We take privacy concerns seriously. That’s why we’ve designed our site so that you can browse freely without revealing your name or any other information about yourself – unless you choose to do so.
Schools Broadband is a specialist division of Talk Straight Group . Talk Straight monitors the number of visits and time spent on this website to provide an indication of the helpfulness of this website (see below) and includes contact forms which contain fields for collecting the name, address, phone number and e-mail address of visitors. This information may be used to respond to any enquiries or complaints and process orders.
We may, in future, allow existing customers to access online billing through the Talk Straight or Schools Broadband websites. Any information entered here may be used by Talk Straight, its associated companies, subsidiaries, agents and business partners for the purposes of managing your account. It may also be disclosed to regulatory bodies for the purposes of monitoring and/or enforcing Talk Straight’s compliance with any regulatory rules/codes.
This information may also be used for offering contract renewals, research and statistical purposes and crime prevention. It may be transferred to any country, including countries outside the European Economic Area for any of these purposes and for systems administration. Where this happens, we will ensure that anyone to whom we pass your information agrees to treat your information with the same level of protection as if we were dealing with it.
If you give us information about another person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide it to us to be able to process their personal data and also that you have told them who we are and what we will use their data for, as set out in this notice.
The Talk Straight and Schools Broadband websites may contain links to other websites. However, Talk Straight is not responsible for the privacy, practices or content of these other sites.
