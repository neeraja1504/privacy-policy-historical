We also may allow third party advertising companies and ad networks to use automatic data collection technologies to collect Website Usage Information for purposes of providing interest based ads. See the Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Website Usage Information and the Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads sections for more information.
User Contributions
This Website may contain public areas, forums, or features that allow you to provide your User Contributions to be published or displayed or transmitted to other users of this Website.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not include any sensitive or personally identifiable information about yourself or others in your User Contributions for these areas of this Website. Please see our Terms of Use for more information concerning User Contributions.
Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Website Usage Information
We and our service providers automatically collect “Website Usage Information” from or about you, such as information about your computer or mobile device, IP address, web browser, computer or device platform, related software and settings you are using, browsing actions and patterns, the referring page that linked you to us and the website you visit after this Website, and other usage activity on this Website. Collection of Website Usage Information helps us to improve this Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to, among other things: (1) estimate our audience size and usage patterns; (2) store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize this Website according to your individual interests; (3) speed up your searches; and (4) recognize you when you return to this Website.
The automatic collection technologies we and our service providers may use for this automatic information collection include:
Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser or related software and stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. Generally, cookies can track what you look at and where you travel on websites and what transactions you make. They can also store Personal Information about you, including your username and password. A “session cookie” expires immediately when you end your browsing session with the particular website. A “persistent cookie” stores information on your hard drive so when you end your browsing session and return to the same website later, the cookie information is still available. This Website may use both types of cookies.
Flash Cookies. Certain features of this Website may use locally stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on this Website.
Web Beacons. Pages of this Website and any e-mails we send to you may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened our e-mails and for other related website analytics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
For more information about managing your privacy settings regarding automatic collection of Website Usage Information, see the Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information section.
Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads
With the exception of certain of our webpages, services or features that may collect sensitive Personal Information such as financial information, we may permit third party advertising companies or ad networks to display third party advertisements on our websites and/or automatically collect Website Usage Information from our websites for purposes of determining your preferences and delivering interest-based advertising and content to you, whether for our products or services or other companies’ products or services.
These third party advertisers may combine the Website Usage Information with Personal Information you directly submit to them or that they receive from other sources, or the Website Usage Information they collect may include information that could allow someone to specifically contact you online without necessarily knowing your identity. We do not have access to or control over the automatic collection technologies that these third party advertisers may use, and the information practices of these third party advertisers are subject to these parties’ respective privacy policies, not this Privacy Notice.
You may want to receive interest-based ads for several reasons. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more likely to be tailored to your particular interests. They are also more likely to help you discover new products and services that are actually relevant to you and your interests. Also if interest-based tracking is enabled, you likely will not see the same ads over and over because the number of times you see a particular interest-based ad is usually limited. By opting-out of interest-based ads, you lose all of these benefits. If you would like more information about opting-out of interest-based ads or would like to opt-out, see the Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information section or visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). We follow the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. Below are some mechanisms that provide you with control over your information:
Promotional E-mails. If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, including our e-newsletters, contact us at privacy@unigogroup.com to opt-out or follow the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the promotional e-mail. Note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive transactional e-mails from us (e.g., e-mails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, password reset requests, reminder e-mails that you have requested, and any other similar communications essential to your transactions on or made through this Website).
Telephone Calls. If you do not wish to receive promotional telephone calls, contact us at privacy@unigogroup.com to opt-out. This opt-out does not apply to any informational telephone calls.
Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Advertising. Our systems currently recognize “do not track” signals from your browser. In addition, the “help” function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your browser to not accept new cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or how to disable cookies altogether. If Flash cookies are used on this Website, you can manage your Flash cookie settings, by visiting the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may be inaccessible or not function properly.
Third Party Interest-Based Ads. We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based ads. However, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the NAI or who follow the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the NAI and DAA websites. If you opt-out, you may still see contextual advertising from us, meaning you may still see personalized recommendations about our products and services and other similar features on this Website. You may also still see ads provided by us or others on other third party websites; they just will not be based on your particular interests. Also note that your opt-out will be managed through the use of cookies, so if you delete these cookies or use a different browser or computer, you will have to make this same election again.

If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties for promotional purposes (i.e., do not opt-out) concerning such information sharing on this Website’s registration page contact us at privacy@unigogroup.com to opt-out. You can also always opt-out by logging into this Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes. However, any subsequent opt-out request will only apply from the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from third parties who received your Personal Information prior to your request. In these cases, please contact the third parties directly.
