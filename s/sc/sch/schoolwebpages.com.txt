You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your personal logon information, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur with respect to your personal logon information.

Because our online services are offered in conjunction with the services of other companies such as network broadband providers, virus protection, and other services necessary to run the business, THiNQ Ed will be sharing your information with those companies. We share the following information: Name, address, phone, school/district, and/or email to properly service you and/or reach you in event of issues. See Terms of Service - Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service - Sale or Distribution of Information.
If THiNQ Ed believes that you are violating THiNQ Ed's Terms of Service or are causing injury through interference or otherwise, THiNQ Ed will disclose personal information necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action, or when THiNQ Ed is legally required to disclose such information.
THiNQ Ed's website does contain links to other websites that may collect personal information about you, and we have no control over the privacy issues of those websites. You must contact such websites for their own privacy policies, if any. See Terms of Service regarding Links/Third Party Websites.
When you provide us with credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes, we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and so we can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
When children under the age of 13 attempt to register with THiNQ Ed, we ask for a parent or guardian to provide consent before we collect any registration information. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. Any privacy policy changes will be posted here.
