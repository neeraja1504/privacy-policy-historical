Our Privacy Rules are applicable in all of our affiliates for the collection, processing, use, dissemination, transfer, and storage of personal information. They impose common rules for all of our entities of all countries, and aim at ensuring  a high level of protection of personal information  within  Schneider Electric.
2. To whom this Privacy statement applies
Schneider Electric is a global company, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. This Privacy Statement applies to all Schneider Electric -owned websites, domains, services, applications, and products, and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("Schneider Electric sites or services"), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular Schneider Electric program, product, or service may supersede or supplement this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy bounds all Schneider Electric subsidiaries and employees.
3. How we process your personal information?
Schneider Electric respects the privacy rights and interests of each individual, employee, candidate or customer. Schneider Electric subsidiaries will observe the following principles when processing your personal information:
1. Processing your personal information fairly and lawfully.
2. Collecting your personal information for specified, legitimate purposes and not processing further in ways incompatible with those purposes.
3. Collecting your personal information which is relevant to and not excessive for the purposes for which it is collected and used.  We may render information anonymous when feasible and appropriate, depending on the nature of the data and the risks associated with the intended uses.
4. Maintaining your personal information accurate, and where necessary, kept up-to-date. We will take reasonable steps to rectify or delete  Data that is inaccurate or incomplete.
5. Keeping your personal information only as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and processed.
6. Processing your personal information in accordance with the individual’s legal rights.

- The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract; or
- The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Schneider Electric is subject; or
- The processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or
- The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data is disclosed; or
- The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Schneider Electric or by the third party or parties to whom the data is disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
All Schneider Electric entities ensure that these principles are observed.
4. Why we collect your personal information?
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide our customers and other users with superior service and a smooth, efficient and personalized experience while using the sites. For example, if you purchase products or request information on the sites, we use your personal information to fill your order or provide the requested information.
Schneider Electric may collect personal Information from you to complete various transactions, such as:
•  product or service orders, activations and registrations
•  profile creation
•  information requests
•  marketing or support subscriptions
•  contest entries or survey participation
•  job applications
5. What information is collected?
Schneider Electric collects and uses your personal information to better serve you and personalize your experience and interaction with Schneider Electric. Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where applicable.
Personal information (or personal data) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
This privacy statement does not cover personal information rendered anonymous or where pseudonyms are used. Data is rendered anonymous if individual persons are no longer identifiable or are identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost, or labour. The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is either impossible or at least rendered considerably more difficult. If data rendered anonymous becomes no longer anonymous (i.e., individual persons are again identifiable), or if pseudonyms are used and the pseudonyms allow identification of individual persons, then this privacy statement will again apply.
It is always up to you whether to disclose personal information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services.
The types of personal information we collect from you may include:
• your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address and shipping address
• customer type, job function, job title, purchasing authority, purchasing timeframe and others
• product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data
• your Schneider Electric user ID and password (where applicable)
• credit card information (where  applicable)
• IP address (see chapter on cookies)
