5. Deleting Information
If you request, we will remove your name and all other personally identifiable information from our databases.

6. Security
We have put in place processes designed to prevent unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, information you provide to us, and we take commercially reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this information. Any password protected sections on our site require users to give us unique identifiers such as their username and password. CCSSO employees (and employees of our affiliates and Site Vendors) are required to acknowledge that they understand and will abide by our policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover, we provide access to our databases containing personally identifiable information on a need-to-know basis only.
Our security systems are therefore structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing information that you provide to us. We also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Please understand, though, that this information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to CCSSO. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, we cannot provide, and expressly disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.
