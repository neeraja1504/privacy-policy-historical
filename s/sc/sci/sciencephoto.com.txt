Disclosures of your personal data
Science Photo Library will not share your information with any third parties, except with the following third parties:
Our distributors in the following countries: the European Economic Area (Group 1), and outside of the EEA, in the following countries: USA (limited to the Privacy Shield framework), Argentina, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland (Group 2), and USA (outside of the Privacy Shield framework), Chile, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand and Ukraine (Group 3). We explain the safeguards we adopted for each of these groups of countries and the United States further below.
Service providers who perform services on our behalf e.g. companies who assist us in direct marketing. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
We may need to disclose information about you if required to do so by law; in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective proceedings; in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; and to the purchaser or prospective purchaser of any business or asset which we are, or are contemplating, selling.
When a licence is purchased on-line we pass some of the personal data entered at registration to our Payment Service Provider. No personal data linked to the card used for the payment is stored at any time on any of the Science Photo Library servers.

International transfers
Under the current data protection law, we can transfer your personal data (as described above) to our distributors based in the EU (Group 1) or the countries in Group 2, which are deemed by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data.
In relation to the United States, this country offers its businesses to be certified under the Privacy Shield certification system which, again, is deemed adequate to ensure safety of your data and enforceability of your rights.
The countries in Group 3 do not, as yet, offer a similar degree of protection as our laws do, however transfers of personal data to those countries is sporadic and undertaken only when necessary for our legitimate interests. In addition to protect your data and your rights, we have adopted the following safeguards:
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK and the EU.

How long will you use my personal data for?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy, which you can request by contacting us.

Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
You have the right to:
Request access
to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction
of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing
of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer
of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time
where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at: privacy@sciencephoto.com.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
