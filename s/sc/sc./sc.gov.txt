Privacy and Security Policy - SC.GOV
Privacy Policy
SC.GOV is a creation and a service of the State of South Carolina (“State”). It is operated and managed under a long-term contract with a private company, South Carolina Interactive, LLC (“SCI” or “South Carolina Interactive”). The term “we” in this policy refers to the State and SCI.
Your privacy and security are our highest priority. Providing electronic access to state government information and services, while maintaining privacy is a specific objective of SC.GOV’s Strategic Business Plan.
SC.GOV collects from users only the personal information necessary to provide the information and services requested by them. Personal information in our possession is maintained and used in ways that respect individual privacy. Employees are educated about the importance of protecting personal information and consumer privacy, and only authorized employees are officially granted access to personal information.
SC.GOV will not disclose personal information collected from users to private third parties unless the law requires such disclosure. Laws do exist in the State of South Carolina to ensure government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by a government agency. At the same time, however, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access certain records in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Such exceptions are authorized by both State and Federal law. Information collected from users by SC.GOV, similarly to information collected during in-person visits to a government office, may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption exists in law. In the event there is a conflict between this Privacy Statement and a State or Federal law governing the disclosure of public records, the applicable law shall control.
The Family Privacy Protection Act of 2002 prohibits persons or private entities from using personal information obtained from State agencies for commercial solicitation purposes. A person knowingly violating this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties specified in S.C. Code Ann. Section 30-2-50(D).
