If you sign in using your account on a third-party social network or other website, we additionally retain your unique ID in that website so that we can identify you when you sign in a second time. We do not access any other information or publish anything on external networks using your sign-in credentials.
We also retain your current settings and preferences in order to personalize your experience.
Creating a room
If you create a room, we will retain the current settings of the room. Additionally, if you choose to integrate that room with your community’s accounts on other social networks or websites, we will store any account credentials you provide for those platforms as long as you choose.
Messages and other content you post
These are retained indefinitely, and their visibility (who can access it) is controlled by the owner of the room to which you post them. Room owners may change this visibility at any time, including making it public.
Private chat messages between users are also retained indefinitely, but they will only be visible to the participants in the private chat.
