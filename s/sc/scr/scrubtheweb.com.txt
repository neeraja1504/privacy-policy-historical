Scrub The Web Privacy Policy
What this Privacy Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Scrub The Web. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information requested.
Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Scrub The Web provides links to websites operated by third-parties, and also provides search results and similar services to third-parties for display on their own websites or applications. Scrub The Web is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third-party websites or applications.
Do Not Track
First and foremost Scrub The Web respects the privacy of our users and we do NOT collect click-stream data or share any user information with anyone except in extreme cases of payment fraud or under specific court order. At Scrub The Web your privacy means " the right to be let alone ". Unfortunately not all businesses feel the same way and because of this the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) felt they needed to get involved. In fact, on December 1, 2010 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a document titled " Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change " (often referred to as " Do Not Track ") which can be downloaded from __  ftc.gov. This document discusses on-line consumer privacy and what steps websites should take to protect consumers.
Many consumers are not aware of the information that is collected and how that information is often used. Below is an excerpt from the FTC document we felt would be of interest to our users to help you better understand how your privacy may be compromised by these malicious businesses and advertisers:
Consumers live in a world where information about their purchasing behavior, online browsing habits, and other online and offline activity is collected, analyzed, combined, used, and shared, often instantaneously and invisibly. For example:
if you browse for products and services online, advertisers might collect and share information about your activities, including your searches, the websites you visit, and the content you view;
if you participate in a social networking site, third-party applications are likely to have access to the information you or your friends post on the site;
if you use location-enabled smartphone applications, multiple entities might have access to your precise whereabouts;
if you use loyalty cards at a grocery store or send in a product warranty card, your name, address, and information about your purchase may be shared with data brokers and combined with other data.
Some consumers are troubled by the collection and sharing of their information. Others have no idea that any of this information collection and sharing is taking place. Still others may be aware of this collection and use of their personal information but view it as a worthwhile trade-off for innovative products and services, convenience, and personalization. And some consumers – some teens for example – may be aware of the sharing that takes place, but may not appreciate the risks it poses
You may notice here at Scrub The Web our pages do not contain third-party advertisers and we do not have or hide third-party code on any of our web pages. Why? Because your privacy is important to us and it is these methods that jeopardize your privacy.
Third-Party Advertisements
Scrub The Web does NOT use third-party advertising companies to serve Ads on our website.
Third-Party Statistics Collection
