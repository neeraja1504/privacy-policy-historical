Articulate Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated effective December 6, 2019.
We are Articulate Global, Inc. ("Articulate") of 244 5th Avenue, Suite 2960, New York, NY 10001, USA. All references to "we", "us", or "our" shall be construed to mean Articulate.
When We Act as Controller and Processor
Articulate will be acting as the "Controller" of the personal data you provide directly to us via a “Contact Us” form, when creating an account, or via other contact methods. You are not required to provide your personal information for purposes of navigating through the public areas of our website.
If you are an employee or an authorized user of one of our customers which have entered into an agreement with us for the provision of our products or services, we will be acting as the "Processor" of your personal data transmitted by our customer. Our customer will be acting as Controller of your information. As processor, we do not own, control, or direct the use of any data provided to us by our customers which act as Controllers.
Personally Identifiable Information
"Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII") refers to contact information that directly or indirectly tells specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, company name, job, email, postal address, or any other information that could be linked to you with reasonable effort. We do not collect sensitive information such as location information (GPS), racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
Passively or Automatically Collected Data
Passively or automatically collected data (referred to as "Usage Data" ) is collected as you use this website. We, our affiliated entities, and our marketing partners may use automated means to collect various types of information about you, your computer or other device used to access this site, its services, related Web applications, and downloadable software. This information is based on your usage of this site and may be based on your visitation to other websites. Usage Data is essentially anonymous when collected, but could be used indirectly to identify a person.
Why We Need Your Data
We need to know the PII you provide to us directly in our capacity as controller for purposes of responding to your inquiry on our Contact Us web page and other contact methods. In addition, we need to know your PII to send you emails for other specific purposes and for sharing your PII for purposes as described in the Information Sharing and Disclosure section below. We also need to know the PII of authorized users of our customers when we act in our capacity as processor for purposes of managing the authorized use of our services.
How We Collect and Use Your Data
Articulate collects PII directly from you when you make an inquiry for an email reply on our “Contact Us” web page and other contact methods, and when you request that we send you emails. Before collecting your PII, you will have the option to give or withhold your consent for our sending you emails including our use of your PII for marketing emails to promote our products or products similar to our products or services. You may withdraw your consent at any time by unsubscribing to our emails by using an opt-out link contained in every non-transactional email or by updating your marketing preferences on your account page.
Articulate uses third-party applications to add firmographic information to the data we collect from you. This data enhancement allows us to provide more helpful, personalized communication.
We collect Usage Data as described above and with “cookies”. For additional information and how to set your browser to refuse to accept “cookies”, see the “COOKIES” section below.
We may make full, unrestricted use of Usage Data for any purpose in our sole discretion, including without limitation, to customize re-marketing ads, offers and content made available to you based on your visits to and/or usage of this site or its services, and to analyze the performance of those ads, offers and content, as well as your interaction with them.
Subject to your right to opt-out, we may combine Usage Data with PII that we collect, and use the combined data to create profiles about you only for purposes of improving our products and services and your user experience with our products and services.
How Long We Keep Your Data
We will not retain your PII for longer than required. This means that we will keep your PII for any or a combination of time periods described as follows: (i) for as long as required by law, (ii) until we no longer have a valid reason for keeping it, (iii) until you request us to stop using it, or (iv) for so long as our customer for which you are an authorized user remains a customer. In addition, we retain your Personally Identifiable Information to preserve history in the E-Learning Heroes community and to provide the ongoing ability to participate. When we delete your PII from our databases, it will remain in our backup system until it cycles out.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
General Disclosure Policy. We may share and disclose your PII as described below. We may share and disclose Usage Data without restriction, including without limitation, as described below. Please contact us at privacy@articulate.com to opt out of all information sharing with a third party.
Affiliated Entities. We may provide your PII and Usage Data to any affiliated entities we may have, including our subsidiaries. Affiliated entities are entities that we legally control (by voting rights) or that control us.
Sub-Processors. We may provide access to your PII and Usage Data to our trusted sub-processors that assist us with the operation and maintenance of this site. For example, we may contract with third parties to process payments, host our servers, provide security, and provide production, fulfillment, optimization, analytics, reporting, and software maintenance and development services. In addition, our sub-processors will be given access to your information only as is reasonably necessary to provide the services for which they are contracted.
Successors. If we sell or otherwise transfer part or all of our business or assets to another organization, such as in the course of an acquisition, merger, bankruptcy or liquidation, we may transfer your PII and Usage Data. In such an event, we will require the buyer or transferee to agree to our commitments provided in this Privacy Policy.

Our resellers are contractually obligated to abide by the Articulate privacy policy, preventing them from sharing your information with any other third parties. Several of our resellers are located in the EU; however, we have determined that our authorized resellers all have suitable safeguards to protect your information. For more information regarding our authorized resellers and their safeguards, request descriptions via our CONTACT US section below.
Marketing Partners for Purposes of Re-Marketing. We may share your information with 3rd party vendors for purposes of re-marketing. For a description of re-marketing and your opt-out rights, see the RE-MARKETING section below.

International Transfers
If you are from outside the U.S., understand that you are sending PII and Usage Data to the United States where our servers are located. That information may be then transferred within the U.S. or back out of the U.S. to other countries outside of your country of residence.

Do Not Track Requests
Some Web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to websites differently, making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. In order to alleviate any communication error between browsers and website, we do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and website improves, we will reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track" signals and may make changes to our policy.
