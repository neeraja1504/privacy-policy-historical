11. STUDENT DATA PRIVACY
We are concerned about student data privacy and make privacy and security safeguards and commitments specifically to protect student Data.
11.1 Authorized Use. We do not collect or use​ ​student Data​ ​for​ ​any ​purpose​ ​other​ ​than to operate and provide our Services to students as described herein and in our Terms.
11.2 FERPA. Our Services are compliant with the Federal​ ​Educational​ ​and​ ​Privacy​ ​rights​ ​Act​ ​("FERPA").
11.3 Data Ownership. Consistent with our Terms, we do not claim ownership of student Data. If a student Account is on an individual Plan, the associated student Data is owned by the student. If a student Account is on a Group Plan, the student Data is owned by the Group Plan Owner, which may be the student’s teacher or educational institution (e.g. school, school district, college or university). If allowed by the Group Plan, the student may associate a personal email address with their Account in order to continue accessing and using their Account and Content if and when their Account is no longer on the Group Plan. Once that occurs, the student Data is owned by the student and the student Account becomes a separate, personal account (“Personal Account”).
11.4 Parent Access. The parent or legal​ ​guardian of a student ​may​ ​access, correct, update, change or delete the student’s PII at any time via the student’s Account settings.
11.5 Third​ ​Party​ Disclosure​. ​ ​Unless legally prohibited, if ​​law​ ​enforcement​ ​contacts​ ​us​ ​with​ ​a​ ​request​ ​for​ student Data, we will​ ​redirect​ ​them​ ​to​ ​request​ ​the​ ​data​ ​directly​ ​from​ the owner of the student Data, which may be the student (or their parent or legal guardian) or their educational institution, depending on which Plan the student’s Account is on.
12. DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION
We are concerned about protecting your Data.
12.1 Secure Service. Our Services have security measures in place designed to prevent the loss and unauthorized use or disclosure of your Data. We​ ​​make​ ​best​ ​efforts​ ​to​ ​secure usernames,​ ​passwords​ ​and​​ ​other​ ​means​ ​of​ ​gaining​ ​access​ ​to​ ​our​ ​Services via your Account​.
1.2 Internal Access. We ​only provide​ access​ ​to​ ​Data​ ​to​ ​employees​ ​or​ ​contractors​ ​who need it in order for us to operate and provide our Services to you. Such employees​ and contractors sign​ ​confidentiality​ ​agreements​ ​and receive training regarding​​ ​this Privacy Policy, Data privacy and security and student data privacy. All​ ​employees​ ​and contractors with access​ ​to​ ​Data shall​ ​pass​ ​criminal​ ​background​ ​checks .
12.3 Secure Transmission. We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving Data exchanged between us and Subprocessors. When​ ​our Services are​ ​accessed​ ​or used via ​a​ ​supported​ ​Web​ ​browser, we use Secure​ ​Socket​ ​Layer​ ​("SSL"), including server​ ​authentication​ ​and​ ​data​ ​encryption​ ​to​ ​help​ ​secure​ Data transmission.
12.4 Back Up and Hosting. Our servers are backed up regularly and protected from virtual and physical compromise. We ​host​ our Services and your Data ​in​ ​an enterprise-class hosting facility in an environment​ ​using​ ​a​ ​firewall​ ​that​ ​is​ ​periodically​ ​updated​ ​according​ ​to​ ​industry​ ​standards.
12.5 Breach. Despite our best efforts to secure and protect Data, we cannot guarantee that your Data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical or managerial safeguards. In the event of such a breach, unless prevented by law enforcement, we will notify you via email and/or a message in an interface of our Services within 2 business days of our discovering the breach. The notification will provide what we know at the time regarding the nature of the breach, when it occurred and what, if any, of your Data may have been compromised.
13. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
13.1 Third Party Tracking. Third parties often collect information about Internet users over time and across websites. As may be the case when you visit other websites and online services, third parties may be able to collect information about you when you access or use our Services, which do not currently respond to browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) mechanisms.
13.2 Removal of Public Posting. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of our Services, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, e-mail us with a detailed description of the specific content or information to privacy@scrible.com. Note that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
14. REVISIONS
We may revise this Privacy Policy posted at our Website at any time. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you of such revision via email or a message in an interface of our Services. You are bound by any such revision and should therefore periodically review the current version of this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that by continuing to access or use our Services after such revision is posted, you accept such revision.
