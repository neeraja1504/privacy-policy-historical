Privacy Policy | ScreenPrism
Welcome to ScreenPrism
ScreenPrism Media, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“ScreenPrism” “us” or “we”) respect your concerns about privacy and value our relationship with you.  This Privacy and Cookie Policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of the types of information we collect, as well as our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of that information through the web pages, tracking devices, interactive features, mobile applications, blogs and their respective contents at ScreenPrism’s URLs, including among others www.screenprism.com, screenprism.com, in addition to our Twitter, Facebook and other social networking sites, and their respective contents (collectively, the “Sites”), and our services (collectively with the Sites, the “Services”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology.  We have established, updated and implemented this Privacy Policy to assist you in enjoying the features of the Sites with the necessary amount of notice, information, and guidance to understand and appreciate how the use of these features and services made available through the Website impact your privacy rights and the rights of our advertisers, partners, sponsors, distributors, artists, writers and contributors to our Websites.
1. Information Collected through our Services
Personal Information You Provide to Us
ScreenPrism is the sole owner of the Site, and is the owner, licensee or authorized party with respect to the “Material” (as defined in the Terms of Use), content and all information collected and presented on the Site.  ScreenPrism may occasionally collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from its Site users who voluntarily provide such information to, among other things: (a) respond to surveys on the Site prepared and sponsored by ScreenPrism; (b) register for special programs, sweepstakes and contests; and (c) through other information exchange methods, including email.  For example, ScreenPrism may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, utilized Services, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.  In addition, you may choose to provide contact information for friends you may wish us to contact.  When you provide us information for these “refer a friend” messages, we use the information only to send the message you request.  Please check that friends you refer are happy for us to contact them.  The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences, product use and interests.
Other information collection practices will continually be monitored, assessed, and updated in light of new technologies, business practices, and for purposes of implementing better and best practices for compliance and business purposes. Now, and in the future, you may be asked to participate in certain enhanced services through the Site. To participate in these services, we may ask you to provide a higher level of Personal Information. Any Personal Information we receive generally and for any special or enhanced service will be stored and managed by ScreenPrism, which does not currently sell or rent this information. We take your privacy seriously. However, to provide our users with better services, we may use the information we collect to share with our business partners for us to provide products or services that may enhance your experience on the Website.
Information Collected by Automated Means
Whenever you use the Services, ScreenPrism as well as any of our third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used (“Usage Information”).  Usage Information may include, among other things, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, how many users visited the Sites, subscriber status, and the preceding page views.  This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.  This information helps us to keep the Services fresh and interesting to our visitors and to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.  Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if ScreenPrism associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, ScreenPrism treats it as Personal Information.
Device Identifiers
In the course of collecting Usage Information, ScreenPrism also automatically collects your IP address, MAC Address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Services.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  When you visit the Sites, we may view your Device Identifier.  We use this information to determine the physical location of your Device, including origin, destination, flight route information, and longitude and latitude information.  We also may use this information to enhance the Services and we may associate your Device Identifier with your Personal Information.  The technologies used on the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include, without limitation:
Cookies
Cookies are small data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites or access the Services (“Cookies”).  We may use Cookies to collect and store certain information about your Account.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).

Cookies do have positive attributes such as remembering what information you accessed on a web page to speed up your transactions on related web pages. Especially for video content and other similar data, you may be required to enable cookies from ScreenPrism in order to utilize the Website. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you have seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on the Website. Such third party use of cookies is subject to that party's own privacy policies which may differ from ours. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.

Web Beacons
We may also include web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking beacons and clear GIFs) with the content and ads that we deliver to you, which we will use to collect information regarding your interaction with such content and ads.  A web beacon is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed or that an email has been forwarded.  In addition, a web beacon allows third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in Cookies set by the third party.  A web beacon may also tell your browser to get content from another server.
ScreenPrism uses cookies and web beacon technology for non personally-identifiable information (including IP addresses) to analyze trends, administer the Website, track user movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifying uses and analytics.
