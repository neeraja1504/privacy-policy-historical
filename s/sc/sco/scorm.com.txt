Cookies
Our sites use cookies to distinguish you from other visitors to provide you with a better experience and to help us improve our sites. By continuing to browse our sites, you are agreeing to our use of cookies as stated below. We also use cookies as part of our Services to the extent reasonably necessary for us to provide these to you and Learners.
A cookie is a small data file placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A “session cookie” expires when you end your session (i.e. close your browser). A “persistent cookie” stores information on your hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A “web beacon” is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image, a redirect URL or JavaScript and is used in conjunction with a cookie.
Cookies used on our sites
Our sites may use session and persistent cookies. The cookies placed by our server are readable only by us, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on your computer. We may use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of our sites and interaction with emails from us. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to our sites, in order to improve our sites and email communications.
Our sites and the Services may contain links to other websites including share and/or “like” buttons. These other websites, services and applications may set their own cookies on users’ computers, collect data or solicit personal information. You should refer to their cookie and privacy policies to understand how your information may be collected and/or used.
Preference Cookies
We use preference cookies to collect information about your choices and preferences, and to allow us to remember preferred settings and customize our sites accordingly.

We also use analytics cookies to collect information about your use of our site, and to enable us to improve the way our site works. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our site, help us record any difficulties you have with our site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on our site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyse the site traffic, but we do not use information to identify individuals.

Remarketing cookies used by us expire after 30 days. To opt out of Remarketing or to control your ad preferences, please click here.

To administer our sites and/or the Services (as applicable) and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes and as part of our efforts to keep our site and Services safe and secure.
How long do we store your data for?
We will keep a copy of your personal data for as long as you remain registered with our sites/the applicable Services or are the contact person or learner of any customer we are dealing with and thereafter for such period as may be required for our legitimate purposes and in compliance with any legal, audit and compliance requirements, provided that in certain cases as outlined below under “Your right” we may delete such data on your request, and further provided that in regard to Services, our specific Terms of service with you or the relevant customer organization may include relevant specific provisions.
Online payments and billing
If you make a purchase for any of our Services, you normally will be required to provide your payment details. These details will be made available in part to both the payment gateway and merchant bank involved. We ourselves will not receive and/or store your credit card details. More details can be found below.
We use Authorize.net as our payment gateway. Authorize.net’s privacy policy can be found here: https://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/.

Once Pinnacle Bank has received authorization that the transaction is complete, it sends this information back to Authorize.Net, which informs you and us that your transaction is complete.
Your personal data will only be used by Authorize.net and Pinnacle Bank for the purposes of processing your payment, and will be securely encrypted. Authorize.net and Pinnacle Bank are both based in the United States, so your transaction may involve your personal data being transferred outside of the EEA directly to them, if you are based in Europe.
We also use Cheddar (www.getcheddar.com) to collate information from our Services in order to calculate and communicate monthly billing to our customers. Cheddar’s Privacy Policy can be found here: https://www.getcheddar.com/privacy. When you make a monthly billing payment, Cheddar will send information to Authorize.net at the backend to process your payment. Authorize.net will then interface with Pinnacle Bank as described above.
Legal basis of our processing of your personal data
We make sure that we only collect and process your data when we have a lawful basis to do so.
Where we operate our sites and perform our marketing efforts, as well as where you open a Services account with us, we determine and control the way in which we process your personal data. We normally market on the basis of your consent, and process your personal data as part of your account registration and our ongoing customer interactions with you based on our legitimate interests of promoting, growing and developing our business and in order to perform our obligations under the contract between us.
In other situations we normally act on behalf of a customer of ours and perform any related data processing on the basis of our legitimate interests of promoting, growing and developing our business and in order to perform our obligations under a contract between us and such customer. In such situations, the relevant customer and account owner is the controller of your data and determines its use.
Your rights
We acknowledge and respect your rights as an individual. If you wish to exercise any of your lawful rights or have questions in this regard, please reach out to us via the contact details provided below.
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. You may also choose not to receive publications or certain other communications from us by explicitly indicating so in the appropriate section of the Registration Form or by opting-out by phone, email or via direct marketing emails sent to you.
We will inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for marketing purposes or if we intend to, or may disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.

You may also have the right to ask us to provide you with data held on you, amend any inaccurate personal data held on you, and/or to delete such data.

That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses.

Where we are aware that any personal information submitted through our sites or our Services belongs to a child, we will delete this personal information from our records.
Whilst this is not our intention, our Services could be used to collect personal information from children under the age of 16.
