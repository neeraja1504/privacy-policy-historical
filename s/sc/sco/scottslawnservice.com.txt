Privacy policy
The Scotts Company takes your privacy seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to our sites, we have developed a privacy statement to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This statement discloses the types of information we gather, how it is used, and how you can gain access to and edit any data that we've collected about you at any time.
Guiding principles
The Scotts Company respects the privacy of individuals who visit our Web sites, send us e-mail, or participate in features/services we offer online. Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been developed using the following guiding principles:
Scotts maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Subscribers to our e-mail services or any other feature/service found on a Scotts Company Web site (scotts.com, miracle-gro.com, ortho.com, roundup.com, osmocote.com, etc.) will not receive unsolicited e-mail messages from Scotts.
Scotts collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our sites. When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.
Scotts will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g., data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access).
Scotts will not share any information you've provided to us with anyone without your consent other than to provide the service you've requested. At the time you register for any such service, you will be notified of, and asked to consent to, the sharing of your information with any particular third party necessary to the provision of the requested service.
Information collected
Non-Personally Identifiable Data: Any time you visit a Scotts Web site, we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site. This information may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address, and any search engine you may have used to locate the site. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Web site, and compile broad statistical data. In addition, The Scotts Company gathers certain navigational information about where you go on our Web sites. This information enables us to determine which areas of the Web sites are most frequently visited and helps us to tailor the sites to the needs and interests of our online visitors. In addition, this tracking data may be used to tailor information presented to you on our sites based on your previous use of the sites and your interests in particular topics.
Information Voluntarily Provided: Any information you provide to us (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.) when you enroll in one of our E-Mail Reminder Services, request information, register on our site, enter one of our contests, or use any of the other interactive portions of our Web sites, is securely maintained on our Web server and internal systems. This information may be used to provide you with information you've requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices. When we request information on our sites, some requests are marked as "Required"; this information is necessary to allow you to participate in the program or service you've requested. You may opt out of receiving future communications at any time (see Opt-Out Procedures below). This data may also be used to tailor your experience on our sites by providing content that is relevant to your interests and geographic region. Finally, we may create aggregated information from information you provide us (such as demographic data) for use in updating and maintaining our sites. This aggregated information will not be shared with others except as noted below (see the "Disclosure of Personal Information" and "Use of Cookies" sections).
Information Collected from Other Sources: To help us better understand and respond to your needs and interests, Scotts may in the future receive information about you from other sources. Scotts will ask any provider of such information to represent and warrant that the information has been gathered and maintained in accordance with all state and federal laws. Any such information will be maintained by Scotts in accordance with the standards set forth in this privacy policy along with other personal information you've provided.
How we communicate with you
Scotts may send authorized communications to you on the basis of the information you provide to us through e-mail or regular mail. We will not contact you by telephone, fax, or other means unless you have explicitly requested us to contact you in that manner. You may also opt out of e-mail and regular mail communications from us at any time (see "Opt-Out Procedures" below).
Disclosure of personal information
Scotts understands the importance of your privacy. We collect and maintain the personal information of our consumers for the use of The Scotts Company and its subsidiaries. We do not sell, rent, or trade consumer information to third parties, other than as described below, and never without your consent.
Business Partners: The Scotts Company may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times to provide expanded services to our site visitors. As part of such a relationship, Scotts may share with these companies the use of certain interactive Web site functions (e.g., the E-Mail Reminder Service). Information provided by site visitors through the use of such interactive functions may be available to both The Scotts Company and its partners.
Agents: Scotts may use other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include administering e-mail services and running special promotions. Such parties only have access to the personal information needed to perform these functions and may not use or store the information for any other purpose. Subscribers or site visitors will never receive unsolicited e-mail messages from agents working on our behalf.
Business Transfers: In the event that Scotts sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of The Scotts Company are acquired, consumer information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.
Compliance with Law/Safety: Scotts may disclose specific personal information based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of our Web sites, the sites themselves, or the public.
With Consent: Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when any personally identifiable information about you may be shared with third parties, and you will be given the opportunity to decline to share that information.
