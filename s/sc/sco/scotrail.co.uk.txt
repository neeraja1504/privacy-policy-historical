We use automated processing to profile customer information in order to help target our products, services and marketing communications more accurately.
We use automated decision making to calculate the validity and value of Delay Repay claims made through our website. You will receive a notification of the outcome of your claim. At this stage you are able to request that your claim is manually reviewed by a member of the Delay Repay team. If you remain dissatisfied you are able to escalate to our Customer Relations team.
We’ll store your information for as long as we are required to by law or regulatory requirement. If there’s no relevant legal or regulatory requirement, we’ll only store it for as long it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected. Some specific retention periods are outlined in the points below.

Customer relations database and season ticket records – records are kept for the duration of the franchise in a restricted access site. We retain season ticket information to allow us to contact you if, for example, your season ticket is lost and to aid the renewal process once the season ticket is close to expiring.

We will provide a response confirming the action we have taken or where we disagree with your request we will provide a response which explains our reasons.

If you have an account with us, by logging in and changing your contact preferences;
Click the unsubscribe link on direct marketing emails; or

Portability – where you have provided us with your personal information and the reasons we are processing it are based on consent or our contract with you, and the processing is automated, you have a right to ask for that information be provided to you or another controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The right may be restricted if it is not practical for us to provide the information in this way or it adversely affects the rights of others.
Automated processing – if we use your personal information on an automated basis to make decisions which significantly affect you, you have the right to ask that the decision be reviewed by an individual to whom you may make representations and contest the decision.

Withdrawal of consent – if we relied on consent as the grounds for processing your personal information, you can withdraw this consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent does not affect the processing carried out beforehand. You can withdraw consent by contacting Customer Relations at: ScotRail Customer Relations, PO Box 27129, Glasgow, G2 9LH, or by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Where you have consented to receive direct marketing communications, you can withdraw your agreement at any time in a number of ways – see 'Object to direct marketing' above. We will act upon such an instruction as soon as possible.
Unless stated otherwise we will aim to satisfy your request, or inform you as to why we are unable to, without undue delay and within 30 days. If we anticipate that we will not meet with this timeframe we will let you know within 30 days and explain what the problem is.
No fee is payable for dealing with rights requests, unless they are manifestly unfounded or excessive or in circumstances where copies have been provided previously. We would always let you know if we thought this was the case, so that you can make a decision about what you wanted to do next.
There are various limitations and exemptions in data protection law which may apply to limit the exercise of rights but we intend only to rely on those limitations and exemptions where it is necessary to do so.
We may revise this Privacy Statement from time to time. The most current version of this Privacy Statement will govern use of your information and will always be available at https://www.scotrail.co.uk.
