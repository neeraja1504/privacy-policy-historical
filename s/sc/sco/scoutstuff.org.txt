Privacy Statement
PRIVACY POLICY & STATEMENT
This privacy policy explains how Boy Scouts of America's Scoutshop.org Website collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the Scoutshop.org (the "Scoutshop.org Website," or "our Website").
Collecting your information
Information is collected through the Scoutshop.org Website. Please note that we may correlate and supplement this data with both aggregate and personally identifiable information gathered from other divisions or companies. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information and information relating to customer purchases in National Scout Shops, and then shares this information for use at Scoutshop.org.
The personal information you may provide to Scoutshop.org or in National Scout Shops is separate and distinct from any personal member information that you may have provided to the Boy Scouts of America through your local council. Therefore, updating or submitting personal information at Scoutshop.org does not update information in Boy Scouts of America membership files. Should you need to update your membership information, please contact your local council.
Important: Boy Scouts of America voluntarily complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 and does not use its Website to collect any personally identifiable information for children under 13 years of age. When we request personally identifiable information to create an account on scoutshop.org, we take all reasonable and customary measures to gain parent or guardian permission prior to accepting information from children under the age of 13 years of age, up to and including denying children the age of 13 the ability, whenever possible, from creating an account. When ""name", "email address" and "date of birth" is requested for account approval by a parent or guardian, this information is temporarily stored, pending such approval. In the event that the parent or guardian declines access to the child or does not respond to the approval request within 10-days, the information is deleted from our files.

We may also use tracking images and applets to collect the same information.
