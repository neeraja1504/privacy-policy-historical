Privacy Policy
This policy covers all users who register to use the scorpionshoes.co.uk website. It is not necessary to register in order to gain access to the searching facilities of the site, but we may restrict access to certain areas as referred to in Principle 2 below. Access to scorpionshoes.co.uk is free of charge to all users.
The scorpionshoes.co.uk website is operated by Scorpion Shoes. We are committed to protecting your privacy when you are using our online services. To protect your privacy, we apply five principles which you can read about below.
Principle 1 - Notice
During our registration process, we ask for personal information which both identifies you and enables us to communicate with you.
To help us prevent fraud, please be aware that we may make searches about you at credit reference agencies for the purpose of verifying your identity. These agencies will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register. The fact that we have requested an identity check is recorded by these agencies, though be assured that the searches will not be seen, or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.
We will use the information you provide only for the following purposes:
To send updates regarding the status of your orders
To send you newsletters and details of offers and promotions in which we believe you will be interested
To improve the content, design and layout of the scorpionshoes.co.uk website and to facilitate knowledge management
To understand the interests and buying behaviour of our registered users
To perform other such general marketing and promotional activities focused on our products and services. We may also register you for our other services which we feel may be useful or of interest to you
Very occasionally, scorpionshoes.co.uk may share your details with carefully selected third parties.  However, if your communication preferences show that you have chosen NOT to receive information from third parties, then of course your details will not be shared.
You can edit your communications preferences at any time via the 'my account' section of our website
This privacy policy only covers the scorpionshoes.co.uk website at http://www.scorpionshoes.co.uk.
Other links within this site to other websites or framed third party sites within scorpionshoes.co.uk are not covered by this policy. We may continue to use your personal information for a period after you cease being a registered user.
Principle 2 - Consent and Choice
If you choose not to register or not provide personal information, you may still visit the scorpionshoes.co.uk website but you will not be able to access the restricted areas available to registered users. By completing the registration process, you accept the Terms and Conditions described and consent to our using your information accordingly.
Principle 3 - Access
We have provided an administration service (your account) where you can review your personal information at any time to ensure it is correct and current. You will be able to update, correct, change or delete inaccurate details. You may also change your choice of opting in or out of marketing and promotional activities, although you may continue to receive mailings for a short period while your order is being processed. You have the right to ask for a copy of your personal information on payment of a small fee.

We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by users inside and outside the company. We will not be transferring your personal information outside of the European Economic Area unless otherwise specifically advised.
