Scanbuy reserves the right to change this Policy from time to time.  Be sure to check this page periodically for updates.  If Scanbuy makes any changes to this Policy, we will notify you by changing the “Effective Date” listed.  If Scanbuy makes any significant or substantial changes to this Policy, we will obtain your express consent prior to your continued use of the Services. Please be advised that failure to consent may result in the Services not functioning properly or not functioning at all.
I.  Securing your data
Scanbuy will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
Scanbuy will store all the personal information you provide on secure servers.
Information relating to electronic transactions entered into via this website will be protected by encryption technology.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure. While Scanbuy uses reasonable efforts to protect your information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Scanbuy cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information.
II. Personal Information
Scanbuy collects personal information that you provide to us.  For example, we collect information when you create an account or a profile, configure your preferences, and when you email, text, call, or otherwise communicate with us.
The types of personal information we may collect include: your ScanLife Account User ID, mobile phone number, email address, account information, age, gender demographic information, information about your preferences and any other information you affirmatively provide to us (for example, as part of a message you send to us).
Scanbuy may be able to collect location based information, such as GPS data, if you have such a phone feature enabled and have provided us with permission to collect such information. ScanLife, upon installation on your mobile device, will provide you with an opportunity to give permission to collect such location based information. If you subsequently choose to stop Scanbuy’s collection of location based information, you can adjust your preferences on your mobile device settings for the ScanLife mobile application.
Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information.
III. Automatically Collected Information
Scanbuy collects certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you use ScanLife.  For example, when you access ScanLife, some information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider, operating system, the service from which you arrived, the page you requested, the time and date of your visit, and potentially other site usage statistics will be collected automatically as part of the software processes of the web page.  For mobile devices, we collect information regarding the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, applications installed on the device, your use of those applications, the type of mobile Internet browser you use when accessing products and services, and anonymous information about the way you use our Services; we may share and allow our third party partners to share this non-identifying information with other third parties that perform targeted advertising activities across other apps and websites. Scanbuy collects your IP address to identify the country in which you are using ScanLife in order to provide you with the most relevant information in response to your requests.
The foregoing information itself does not personally identify you, but could potentially be linked with personal information that you provide us.  These statistics allow Scanbuy to analyze the effectiveness of its website and software applications and make improvements where needed. Upon installation on your device, we will provide you with an opportunity to consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such non-personally identifiable information as described in this policy generally and in the Use and Disclosure section in particular. Please note that such non-personally identifiable information may be required in order for the Services to function properly. Please see  Data Retention Policy; Managing Your Information; Opt-out Rights  below to review your choices regarding your information.
IV. Cookies Persistent Device Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers and Other Technologies
Scanbuy, along with our third party service partners and business partners, use cookies, Web beacons, persistent device identifiers (e.g. Android ID), advertising identifiers (e.g. Google’s “Advertising ID,” Apple’s “IDFA”) and other technologies. These technologies are used for tracking, advertising, analytics and personalization and optimization of the Services. The information collected through these technologies may not necessarily correlate to the information described in the Automatically Collected Information section above.
Cookies. A Cookie is a string of information that a website saves on a visitor’s computer or mobile device and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website operator each time the visitor returns.  Merchant partner will place a cookie or similar technology on visitor's device when an ad is clicked.
Persistent cookies remain on the visitor’s computer or mobile device after the browser has been closed.
Session cookies exist only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from the visitor’s computer or mobile device when they close the browser software.
Persistent Device Identifiers. Persistent device identifiers are unique strings that are associated with the mobile device that you use to connect to the Services. Persistent device identifiers may be modified or disabled by sophisticated users. Some persistent device identifiers can only be reset by wiping the entire device.
Advertising Identifiers. Advertising identifiers (e.g. Google’s “Advertising ID,” Apple’s “IDFA”) are unique strings associated with your mobile device provided by the operating system. Advertising identifiers may be modified or disabled by users in the operating system settings. See the Do Not Track section for more information about how to configure these settings.

Please refer to your browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete or disable cookies and other tracking technologies.
V. Do Not Track

If the “do not track” setting is disabled, we may record when a user installs the App. We may also run targeted advertising on third party applications via our advertising display partners. For users who have enabled the “do not track” setting in iOS or Android, this data will not be collected.
Please note that the “do not track” setting may not be available on all operating systems or versions of ScanLife. The “do not track” settings require iOS 6 or later, or Android 2.3 or later.  In order for the “do not track” settings to function on ScanLife, you must have a version of ScanLife installed which is up to date as of the effective date of this Policy.

VI. Anonymous & Aggregate Information
Scanbuy collects some information on an anonymous basis. Scanbuy may also anonymize some personal information so that it cannot be readily used to personally identify an individual user.

This information is sent with the device’s advertising identifier or another unique device-specific code. Sense360 may use all of this information for market research and other research regarding aggregated patterns, and as further described in its Privacy Policy, which has more detail on the entire process. For example, Sense360 analyzes restaurant visit trends to better serve its customers’ needs. You can use your device settings to (i) disable or limit precise geolocation collection for the entire device (which will affect some device functionality) or just particular apps (which may affect the functionality of this app) and/or (ii) disable or limit use of the advertising identifier (which will block that identifier’s transmission to Sense360).
