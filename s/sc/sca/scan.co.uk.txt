Purposes of Processing
Personal data is collected and processed during the operation of our website, we only store personal data for as long as required. We may use third party service providers to help with this processing, they act as a 'data processor' on our behalf and only use the data collected in ways we specify for our own purposes. The categories of third parties which we work with include IT service providers, Delivery Agents, Payment Service Providers and Marketing Companies.
We only process the minimum personal data necessary and use industry standard data masking techniques where possible (pseudonymisation / anonymisation). We have outlined some of this activity and the parties involved (data processors unless otherwise stated) below:
Improving the usability of our website
We process data such as online identifiers and behavioural data in order to measure performance and improve the user experience of our website.
Our website uses Webtrends to provide A/B testing functionality. This lets us see the impact of changes to our website by measuring things like number of clicks on a button. We aggregate the data and use statistical analysis to decide which change performed better. We don't use this data to identify you directly.
Our web site may use SessionCam for analysis. SessionCam is a product that has been developed by SessionCam LTD. SessionCam may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. The information collected does not include bank details or any sensitive personal data. Data collected by SessionCam from our website is for our internal use only. The information collected is used to improve our website usability and is stored and used for aggregated and statistical reporting.
You can set your preferences around this type of processing on our privacy dashboard.
Traffic & Security
When you browse our website the requests are sent via the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare will process online identifiers in order to ensure that our traffic is genuine and prevent cyber-attacks such as a Denial of Service attack. We will also keep logs of requests to our website, the data collected may include your IP addresses.

Creating an Online Account
When you create an online account with us you provide us with information that we use to remember you and enable you to check out faster. This also gives you access to features such as Order History, Saved Baskets.
We do not have the ability to recover the password you specify and read it in plain text. This is stored in a one-way hashed format which is computed using the key derivation function PBKDF2, using a randomly generated salt and very high number of iterations.

Placing an Order

We will need to provide your delivery and contact information to the delivery agent that you have chosen at checkout (e.g. DPD, UPS).
The payment information you provided will be used by our payment service providers in order to complete the transaction. Any credit card details are securely stored with our Payment Service Provider (Braintree / PayPal). For display purposes, we store your credit card number (PAN) in a masked format in line with PCI standards. If you have chosen to save your card to your account, we use a token provided by Braintree to authorise your credit card on subsequent orders, you can delete any saved cards using My Account.
We will contact you by email to provide you with order status updates, when you give us your mobile telephone number we may send you SMS messages for important information about your order.

We will ask for your consent when entering a competition to do this.
