This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal information gathered when you are using or accessing the Service. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any personal information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
3. Information We Collect and How We Collect It
When you use the Service, you provide us with three types of information: (i) information you submit via the Service; (ii) information regarding your use of the Service collected by us as you interact with the Service; and (iii) information from Third-Party Websites and services. The information we gather enables us to personalize content and features, improve and continue to operate the Service and to provide you with the services and information you request. In connection with certain aspects of the Service, we will request, collect and/or display your personal information.
We collect several types of information from and about you, including:
Information you give us that identifies you, which includes, your email address, legal name, physical or postal address, date of birth, gender and photographs identifying you or other depictions of your likeness and related information like demographic information such as the industry in which you work; and
Technical information about your use of our Service, which includes, for example, internet connection, your computer or mobile device and operating system, browser and other software you use to access our Service, as well as your Internet Protocol (" IP ") address or other device identifiers.
Below, we detail the specific types of information we collect from our users.
Educational Services or Service Information
When you provide information for processing on the Service, you will provide information that could be personal information. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by using the Service and providing personal information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you, and therefore, you will not be anonymous.
We will use your contact information to send you information about our Service or to send marketing emails. You can with withdraw your consent at any time by clicking on the opt-out button which is found in our marketing emails. If you opt out, we will still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about educational services and our business dealings with you. We also reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary.
IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically
We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Service, including your IP address and cookie information. Generally, the Service automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Service. We will use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Service so that we can analyze and improve them.
Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Beacons
"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your web browser when you access a website, and the files are stored on your device's hard drive. We use "session" cookies to keep you logged in while you use our Service, to track your preferences and to track trends and monitor usage and web traffic information on our Service. These are erased when you close your browser. We use "persistent" cookies to relate your use of our Service to other information about you and store information about your preferences to make your user experience consistent and customized. For example, we will create a persistent cookie that includes basic information about you, like your favorite website locations and whether customer support responded to your inquiry. These cookies stay on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire and associate your information with your account even if you are logged out.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your settings on the browser settings to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting cookies. You can also use your browser settings or other tools to delete cookies you already have. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, then certain features of our Service will be inaccessible or not function properly.
Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain personal information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are, except to provide customized information tailored to specific interests and/or information you provide SCAD. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Service and will associate that information with your Account if you have one.
This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third-party websites to which links point may set cookies on your computer.
We use web analytics tools that help us understand how users engage with the Service. Like many services, we use first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use the Sites. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Service. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.
Clear GIFs and Pixel Tags
We use " clear GIFs " (also known as " web beacons " or " pixel tags ") or similar technologies, on our Service or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a part of our Service or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a website or in an email or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote website on the internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a website or message.
We do not automatically collect personal information unless directly provided by you in order to receive communications from us, but we will tie personal information with the automatically collected information using the above tools or information collected from other sources.
We also log information using digital images called web beacons on our Service or in our emails. We use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.
The Service does not respond to internet browsers' Do Not Track (" DNT ") signals.
Information Related to Advertising
To support and enhance the Service, we serve advertisements, and also allow third-party advertisements, through the Service. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and will come from third-party companies called "ad networks." Ad networks include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
Advertisements served through the Service will be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and will be based on (i) anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including personal information, (ii) Service usage patterns of particular users, or (iii) your activity on a third-party website. We do not provide personal information to any ad networks for use outside of the Service.
4. Minors and Children Under Age 13
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for our Service. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to use or register for our Service or send any personal information about yourself to us, including your name, physical address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 will provide any personal information to SCAD or on the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information where reasonably possible. If you believe that we have any information from or about a child under 13, please send a detailed message to web@scad.edu.

Additionally, in the following circumstances, we will disclose your personal information without your consent:

If disclosure is required, permitted or authorized by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or where a regulatory authority has the power to request the provision of certain records or information);
