Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with services). In this case, we may have to cancel the service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you remain engaged with the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with SCA.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
If you’ve indicated an interest in taking part in one of our programmes, we’ll retain your data for a period of three years from the point that you last engage with us.
Will We Disclose Your Personal Data?
Internal Parties
We may share your personal data with our branch offices and subsidiaries in order to deliver upon performance of a contract with you, or for purpose or activities related to the above section Purpose for which we will use your Personal Data.
Apart from meeting the needs of your request, such as connecting you with your local National Chapter (where one exists in your country), we’ll never share or sell your data to third parties to use for their own purposes unless we’re required to do so by law. For example, we may do this when receiving a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.
Your information may be shared with our educational partners where necessary to provide you with a service you’ve requested.
External Parties
SCA sometimes uses third parties to process your information on our behalf, for example to provide services (e.g. 25 magazine subscription, event registrations, membership fulfilment etc.) or analysis. We require these third parties to comply strictly with your instructions and that they don’t use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to them using your personal information in this way.
We may use information which we hold about you to show you relevant advertising on third-party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, and Twitter). If you don’t want to be shown targeted advertising messages from SCA, some third-party sites allow you to request that you don’t see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future. For more information on this, please review the relevant advertiser’s privacy policy on their own web page or app.
We may share your personal data with third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
International Transfers
Although most of the information we store and process stays within the European Economic Area GDPR compliant third-party platforms, some information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
We may share your personal data within the SCA Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Many of our external third parties (such as Google, Wufoo, Typeform and Shopify) are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please contact us at dataprotection@sca.coffee if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
Data Access, Updates, and Removal
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
You may request in writing that SCA disclose details of data which it holds about you and the purpose for which such data is held. We’ll need your passport or driver’s licence for proof of identity. We’ll use reasonable efforts consistent with our legal duty to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files.
You may have the right to update or amend the information we hold about you if it is incorrect. Under certain circumstances you may have the right to ask us to remove your personal information from our records. To request access, updates or removal of your data please contact dataprotection@sca.coffee.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Cookies Policy
What Are Cookies and How Does SCA Use Them?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (all referred to here as a "device") web browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive.
Each website can send its own cookie to your web browser if your browser's preferences allow it. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Similar technologies are also often used within emails to understand whether the email has been read or if any links have been clicked. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume you’re happy to receive all cookies on the SCA website.
On SCA Website, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our website to your interests.
During the course of any visit to a SCA Website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
How does SCA use cookies?
Information supplied by cookies can help us to understand the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. It also helps us recognise when you’re signed in to your SCA account and to provide a more personalised experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our faculty research pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight faculty research information on your second and subsequent visits. SCA uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users.
Third-party cookies in embedded content on SCA pages
Please note that during your visits to SCA websites, you may notice some cookies that aren’t related to SCA.
We sometimes embed content from social media and other third-party websites. These may include YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and SoundCloud. As a result, when you visit a page containing such content, you may be presented with cookies from these websites and these third-party cookies may track your use of the SCA website. SCA doesn’t control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party's website for more information. If you continue without changing your settings, we'll assume you’re happy to receive all cookies on the SCA website.
Where SCA embeds content from social media and other third-party websites, some websites may use Google Analytics to collect data about user behaviour for their own purposes. SCA doesn’t control this. For more information, see the Google webpage “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”
SCA cookies
It’s important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, you won’t be able to take full advantage of some of our services’ features – and we might not be able to provide some features you have previously chosen to receive.
Other information collected from web browsers
Your web browser may also provide SCA with information about your device, such as an IP address and details about the browser you’re using. We use information provided by your browser or by the link that you’ve clicked to understand the webpage that directed you to SCA and this may be captured by performance cookies.
If you have any concerns about the way that we use cookies or respect your settings, then please email dataprotection@sca.coffee
Apps and Devices
When you download or use SCA apps on your mobile device, information may be accessed from or stored on your device. Most often this is used in a similar way to a web browser cookie, by enabling the app to ‘remember’ you or provide you with the content you have requested.
Your web browser or device may also provide SCA with information about your device, such as a device identifier or IP address. Device identifiers may be collected automatically, such as the device ID, IP address, MAC address, IMEI number and app ID (a unique identifier relating to the particular copy of the app you’re running).
When signing in to a SCA app, your sign-in details may be stored securely on the device you’re using, so you can access other SCA apps on the same device without needing to enter your sign-in details again. If you have any concerns about any information that might be accessed from or stored on your device by SCA, you may wish to only access SCA content through a web browser and review your web browser settings.
Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Offensive and Inappropriate Content
If you post or send content which may reasonably be deemed to be offensive, inappropriate or objectionable anywhere on or to SCA Website or social media channels, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any SCA service, we may remove such content.
Where SCA reasonably believes that you are in breach of any applicable laws, we may disclose your personal information to relevant third parties, including law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. SCA would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including data protection law.
