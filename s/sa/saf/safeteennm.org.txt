GENERAL PUBLIC
PRIVACY AND DATA COLLECTION POLICY
SAFETEEN Inc. respects the privacy of the individuals and businesses accessing/using (“Users”) its website (“Website”). The purpose of this General Public Privacy and Data Collection Policy (“Policy”) is to inform Users about information that may be gathered about them when they visit the areas of SAFETEEN’s Website accessible to the public (“Public Areas”).
SAFETEEN Inc. collects limited information about Users who visit the Public Areas of the Website. This information is automatically collected on an aggregate basis (“Aggregate Information”) to measure traffic on the Website, including the Agent Locator. Aggregate Information may be collected through the use of a “cookie” or small text file placed on the User’s hard drive by the User’s Internet browser. The cookie allows SAFETEEN Inc. to track the number of hits or visits to various pages on the Website, including the Agent Locator. When SAFETEEN’s Website is accessed through a hyperlink on another website, the cookie will identify and track the Internet Protocol address (“IP”) that linked the User to the Website. If the User did not hyperlink to SAFETEEN’s Website from the most recently visited IP, then SAFETEEN Inc. will only identify the User’s Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL.com, yahoo.com, etc.). The cookie is used only during a single connection to the Website and Agent Locator, and is not used to track User activity after leaving the Website and Agent Locator. It is permanently disabled when the User exits the Website, and information about individual Users is not collected, saved or distributed to others by SAFETEEN Inc. Aggregate Information and other information gathered through voluntary User surveys and forms assists SAFETEEN Inc. to better understand Users’ needs and improve the Website, and to enable SAFETEEN Inc. to demonstrate to vendors and others information about the volume and nature of its Website traffic.
The Website and Agent Locator contain hyperlinks to Internet sites of SAFETEEN Inc. members and other businesses and resources, and each Internet site may have its own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  SAFETEEN Inc. is not responsible for the privacy and data collection policies and practices of any of its members or other businesses and resources, or for the content of their Internet sites. Users interested in the privacy and data collection policies and practices of SAFETEEN Inc. member or other businesses and resources should review their policies.  SAFETEEN Inc. makes no representations of any kind about the Internet sites of its members or other businesses and resources, and SAFETEEN Inc. disclaims all warranties and responsibilities of any kind, including, without limitation, warranties and responsibilities with respect to SAFETEEN Inc. members’ and other businesses’ and resources’ Internet sites, content, privacy and data collection policies and practices, and actions.
