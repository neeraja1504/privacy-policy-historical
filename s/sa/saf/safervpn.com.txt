2. Information We Collect (And Don’t) From You, Why We Need It, And How We Use It
What Safer Social Ltd. Retains From SaferVPN sessions:
- a time stamp when you connect and disconnect to our VPN service;
- the amount of data transmitted (upload and download) during your session;
- the IP address used by you to connect to our VPN;
- the IP address of the individual VPN server used by you.
We DO NOT store details of, or monitor, the website you connect to or any of the data sent over our network when using our VPN service.
We collect this data for the operation of our business because we need to:
monitor the use of our network for technical purposes and to manage our service;
prevent and detect fraud against our service (e.g. credit card fraud);
prevent and detect abuse of our network, such spamming, file sharing or other illicit activity.
What Safer Social Ltd. Retains From SaferVPN registered users:
- If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will direct you to make payment through a third party payment processor. We currently use the following third party payment providers: PayPal, Bitcoin, Skrill, Online transfer, Alipay, WebMoney, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
- The third party site will provide us with, and we will then store, the date on which you made the payment and the date that your account will expire, along with a generic number (your "Order ID Number") and in case you selected credit card payment option we will store the last four digits of your credit card number. We do not store your name, home address (unless you entered them) but this data may be stored by the third party payment provider handling the transaction and may be accessible by us.
- We store this information as it enables us to know when your account will expire and to prevent and detect fraud. We need your Order ID Number so that we can link your order to your account.
- We are not responsible for any third party payment provider handling your transaction and you should refer to the third party payment provider's privacy policy to see how they use your data.
3. Non-Personal Information Safer Social Ltd. Collects from www.SaferVPN.com and How We Use It:
- Using services, such as Google Analytics, we collect certain aggregated and non-personal information when users visit our Site.

By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Site to our visitors. Through the use of web analytics software, Safer Social Ltd. may use “cookies” to assist the tracking of how users engage our website. A cookie is a piece of data that the web server stores on the browser's PC which the web browser will then send back to the web server on any future requests, to facilitate identification of the user should they visit the website again. While much of the information that we collect from users in this manner is not personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that users voluntarily provide to us through our web site.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
- We keep your personal data only as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented), for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), and as permitted or required by applicable law.
