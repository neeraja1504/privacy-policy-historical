Privacy Policy of SafariBookings.com
We highly value your trust in us and will duly and diligently safeguard and protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.
We highly value your trust in us and will duly and diligently safeguard and protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.
This privacy policy applies to all of our services, whether accessed or made available online or through any other platform or device (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Site", "site", "Website" or "website").
We don't spam. Period. (When we do and don't send emails)
We won't email you unless you have expressly indicated you want us to. We will only email you in one of the following cases:
You use the password recovery option, where we email you instructions on how to reset your password.
You activate the optional feature to receive a periodical newsletter by email. Please note: you can always deactivate this feature by unsubscribing. Each newsletter contains an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.
You use one of our contact forms because you have a question or want to provide feedback to us. In those cases, you may receive a copy of your message and our reply to your request.
You use one of our contact forms to contact a safari company and request a quote for a tour. In those cases, the safari company may email you in reply to your request.
If we believe it is vital to contact you and share certain information, we may decide to email you. We will only do so in extraordinary cases such as, for example, when the site or the company holding your personal information is sold and a new owner will govern and safeguard your personal information. Commercial messages or advertising are not considered vital, so we will never use this as an excuse to send spam.
What information we collect and for what purpose
Personal information
We keep the amount of personal information we collect to an absolute minimum and only collect it if strictly necessary or with your consent. You are not obliged to provide your personal information, but this may lead to us not being able to provide you with our services.
We will not process or store your personal information for any longer than is necessary for the purposes which we collected or processed this information, unless a longer storage period is required by any applicable law or regulation. We process the following information:
User reviews
Upon submitting a user review, we will ask you to provide a screen name (which can be your full name or your first name only) and you will be given the option to provide more info about yourself such as your gender, age, safari experience level, country of residence and photos of your safari. The IP address from where you uploaded the review will also be stored in our databases for spam prevention reasons. We also ask for your email address so that we can contact you in case there is a problem with your review or if other website users have a question about your review. All this info will be publicly visible, except for your IP address and email.
When other users have a question about your review, they can fill out a form that does not reveal your email address and we will forward their question to you by email. In addition, every question that is forwarded to you by email contains an unsubscribe option in case you no longer want other users to be able to ask questions about your review.
It could be that a safari company uses our invite service to send you an email that invites you to review their company on SafariBookings. In that case, your name and email address will be stored in our database to ensure the safari company cannot invite you again for the next 90 days.
Email notifications regarding your review and/or review invite will be sent to you, us and the safari company that is being reviewed. These emails contain your name and email address.
Storage period:
* All personal information associated with a review will be anonymized 90 days after a review has been deleted.
* Email invites stored in our database will be anonymized after one year.
Quote requests
You could decide to use an email form on our website to contact a safari company and request a quote for a tour. These quote requests contain your name, email address, phone number and IP address. Your IP address is stored for spam prevention reasons and will not be shared with the safari company. The quote requests will be emailed directly to the safari company with a copy to you and us. The copy to us will also be stored in our database.
Storage period:
* After two years all personal information associated with a quote request will be anonymized.
Email forms to contact us, SafariBookings
You could decide to contact us by email. These emails will be stored in our email inboxes. We can use the email address or other contact information to get back to you in response to your request.
If you use our email forms to report a technical problem with our website we will also collect your IP address for support purposes. The IP address is used to locate your browse session in our log files, which enables us to further investigate the reported problem.
Email Newsletters
You may decide to subscribe to one or several of our newsletters in order to periodically receive safari-related news, tips, articles and/or offers by email. When subscribing, your name and email address will be shared with us. Every newsletter that you receive contains an unsubscribe option in case you no longer want to receive these emails.
Storage period:
* If you unsubscribe, you will stop receiving newsletters instantly and your name and email address will be removed from our systems within 90 days.

You can register your SafariBookings account by either using an email address and password or by using your Facebook or Google login. Your email address will be stored by us to enable you to sign in and gain access to your account and its features.

Information you share with our community
Any information you add to your profile and/or messages (e.g. topics, posts, questions, replies) will be publicly visible and/or shared with the other members of the community. We recommend you don't share personal information about yourself, such as: your full name, address, personal photos or email address; but if you do decide to do so, it is your own responsibility.

Log file data
As with the majority of web sites you visit, our website and servers employ log files. These log files record non-personally identifiable data, with the exception of IP addresses. The processing of this data will have little or no impact on your privacy. The log files are used to provide insight in the way our site is being used and, if errors occur, log files provide extra insight into what caused the errors and how to fix them.
Storage period:
* Our log files are deleted after 30 days.
Computer information
If you use one of the email forms to report a technical problem we will collect non-personally identifiable computer information, such as: the type of browser you are using (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome), the type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows, Mac OS), the screen or window resolution of your monitor and device type (e.g. PC, iPhone, iPad). We collect this information since it helps us greatly find the problem and it has little or no impact on your privacy.

Disclosure and/or transfer of data
We keep your personal information confidential and we generally do not disclose it, unless we have your permission hereto, or this is necessary for the performance of a contract, to comply with a legal obligation or for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We may for instance disclose or transfer some of your personal information in the following situations:
When you use an email form on SafariBookings to request a quote from a safari company, we share your message and email address with them. Disclosing this personal information is necessary in order for the safari company to contact you and further discuss the possibility of booking a tour with them.
When you subscribe to one or several of our newsletters, we share your email address with MailChimp, our email service provider, in order to send you these newsletters.
We may share your personal information with SurveyMonkey to let you participate in a survey or questionnaire.
Where necessary we will share your personal information with our third-party providers (e.g. IT providers, CRM providers, marketing service providers, analysts, customer service providers, business development providers and legal service providers) as well as affiliated companies (e.g. parent, sister or daughter companies). They access and use the information on our instructions and on a “need to know” basis only.
To host our files and data, including some of your personal information, we make use of certain web and cloud hosting providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google, and Dropbox.
We may share your personal information with certain social media sites for marketing activities.
If you have explicitly agreed to the terms of use for our website and we are in the process of selling our company, website or substantial parts of our business, we may disclose and/or transfer your personal information to the (potential) new owner so they can better value our business. If sold, your information will be transferred so that the new owner is able to continue operating this website. This will also be the case if the new owner is a non-EU company, organization or individual.
We may also share your personal information to respond to law enforcement requests, court orders or any other legal process or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or respond to illegal activities, fraud, and physical threats to you or others or as otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation.
Where applicable, we have concluded agreements with our third-party providers to protect your personal data.
Some of these companies may be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area. The companies that are located in the United States are participants of and certified by the EU US Privacy Shield, which guarantees an adequate level of data protection. For companies in other countries your personal information is safeguarded either because of the European Commission deciding these countries have an adequate level of protection or because your personal information is safeguarded by contractual clauses in the agreements we have with these companies. If you want to receive more information about these safeguards, you can contact us by sending an email to privacy@safaribookings.com.
Security measures
We take strict security measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These measures include limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems, data encryption and password protections, which guard against unauthorized access.
Control over your data
You are entitled to object to us processing your personal data. You may also access your information, ask us for an overview of your information or ask for a copy. You may also request us to correct or delete certain data, restrict processing of your data, or ask us to transfer some of this information to you or other organizations. In some cases you may object to the processing of your data and, where we have asked for your consent to process personal data, you can withdraw this consent at any time. If the processing is solely based on your consent, we will not process your personal information any longer. Where we process your data for our legitimate interests, you can contact us if you want more information about these.
There are some exceptions to these rights. For example, it will not be possible for us to delete your data if we are required by law to keep it or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you. Similarly, access to your data may be refused if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. We will always inform you if we will not comply with your request for any reason whatsoever.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below.
We will provide you with information on action taken on your request within one month after receiving this request. Depending on the complexity and number of requests we may extend this period by two further months, in which case we will also inform you.
