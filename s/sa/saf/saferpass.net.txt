SaferPass GUIDING PRINCIPLES. The passwords you store in your SaferPass are encrypted on your device using a master password that only you know. Your passwords will be encrypted on your device and will be sent to SaferPass in encrypted form through a secure connection for storage in order to enable synchronization with your other devices. SaferPass never stores your master password on any server so your passwords can't be retrieved by anyone but you. When you need to access your passwords the decryption of your passwords is done on your device with your master password. Your passwords can only be accessed by you with your master password unless you decide to share or bequeath passwords with another SaferPass user. No SaferPass employee can ever access your passwords. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO RECOVER YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD. We don't ask for your personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t store your personal information on SaferPass servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles: 1. CONSENT.
