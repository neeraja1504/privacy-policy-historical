Obtaining Your Personal Information
We may obtain personal information about you when you register to use this website, place an order with us or when you provide feedback about our products or services.
Processing Your Personal Information
We will use the personal information that you provide us with to process your order for our products or services and to ensure that any goods ordered are delivered to the address specified.
When you place an order with us we may, if necessary, contact you to confirm that we are fulfilling the order in accordance with your instructions and according to our own high standards. We may also contact you to provide or obtain any other pertinent information concerning your order.
When you enquire or provide feedback about our products and services we will use the contact details that you have provided to respond to you.
Any feedback that you provide will help us to understand how our products and services are perceived by our customers and which of our products and services are of most interest. We may use such information to tailor our service offerings to suit your needs and improve our product and service offerings for the benefit of our customers generally.
In order to source the product that you require and ensure that it is delivered to the delivery address that you have specified as quickly as possible, it sometimes may be necessary for us to pass your delivery address details to an external publisher or supplier acting on our behalf to enable them to dispatch the goods that you have ordered directly to you. However, your order will always be managed by TSO and we will only provide our suppliers with the minimum information necessary to facilitate the delivery of the goods to you, such as your name, address and the details of the products to be supplied. Our suppliers have provided sufficient security guarantees in relation to any personal information that we might provide them with for these purposes and they are required to act only on our instructions in relation to any such information.
Direct Marketing Material
We may use your personal information to keep you informed of our products, services and events that we feel may be of interest to you or your business. We may also use your personal information to keep you informed of new and/or existing products that are similar to those which you have previously purchased.  All recipients of the newsletter have consented to receiving such material.
You may at any time ask us to cease or not commence sending you direct marketing material by contacting our customer services division on Tel: +44 (0)333 202 5070 or by sending an email to tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk.
Upon receipt of notification that you do not wish to receive marketing material from us, we will action your request within a reasonable time period.
