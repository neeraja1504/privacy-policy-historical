Collection of Information:
Non Personally Identifiable Information (Cookies):
STS uses cookies solely for internal recordkeeping and aggregating data about the traffic on the Site.  Third parties may, however, be placing and reading cookies on your users' browser, or using web beacons to collect information, in the course of ads being shown on your screen.  If you choose not to accept cookies from the Site or from third parties, you may disable that option through your web browser.
When someone visits our websites, we automatically receive their computer’s IP address.
If you use any features available on our website by a third party, it may result in information being shared between us and the third party. For example, if you use Facebook’s “Like” feature, Facebook may register it and may post that information on Facebook, or ads from our company may appear in your stream.
Cookies:
We use “cookies,” including tracking pixels. These pixels are connected to outside platforms, which may include Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, and other companies.

- zip code,
- date of birth,
- email address, and
- any other personally identifiable information that you submit in correspondence with STS, in your STS profile or on the Site.
STS does not allow children under the age of 13 on the Site, nor does STS knowingly collect any information from any person under the age of 13.  If STS is informed that a profile or user account is being made by a person under the age of 13, STS will immediately remove the posting and any personally identifiable information that may have been inadvertently collected by STS.
Your safety is important to us.  Please keep in mind that any information you provide to anyone you meet through the Site is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Remember to be vigilant about protecting your personal information.  If you are going to meet someone that you have connected with on the Site, STS recommends that you meet them in a public place.
Use of Personally Identifiable Information:
STS will use the personally identifiable information that it collects about you to contact you in response to consumer-initiated inquiries, to provide the services to you that you request, to alert you to changes in services or features, and to provide you with requested information regarding STS or our services.  We may, from time to time, contact you about offers that we, or third parties with which we may partner, have that we believe, in our sole discretion, may interest you.
STS reserves the right to release current or past user information: (a) in the event that we believe that the Site is being or has been used in violation of STS's Terms and Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (b) upon receipt of a properly authorized and authenticated governmental request for information; (c) in response to a subpoena or a court order, (d) to comply with relevant laws; (e) in response to an investigation of fraud regarding a specific consumer; (f) in an effort to safeguard the person or property of a STS employee or a third party; or (g) if STS is sold or acquired.
Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when STS, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.
If you no longer wish to receive emails from us which you have not specifically initiated, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable e-mail.  STS processes all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion.
International Users:
By using the Site and providing STS with data, you understand and agree that due to the international dimension of the Internet, STS may use the data collected in the course of our relationship as set forth in this Privacy Policy or in other communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, you acknowledge that your personally identifiable information and other data may be stored on servers located in the United States or in other international locations. By providing us with your information, you consent to the transfer and storage of such information.
SPAM:
STS does not tolerate Unsolicited Commercial Emails (also known as "SPAM") or other unsolicited emails to our users.  Your use of the services on the Site does not authorize you in any way to add other users of the Site to your physical or email mailing list without their express consent.  If it is brought to our attention that you are sending unsolicited emails to our users, we will immediately terminate your account and will cooperate with all legal authorities to aid in your prosecution for violations of state and federal SPAM laws.
Third Party Sites:
Users listing products for sale or third party advertisers on the Site may direct you to a third party website.  Those websites are not affiliated with STS and their privacy policies may differ from STS's privacy policy.  STS is in no way responsible for the privacy policies or treatment of information from third party websites and strongly encourages you to review the privacy policies of every website you visit to determine what information they collect and how such information is handled by that website.
How We Store Private Information:
Our shopping cart and online payment processing is provided by Recurly and Authorize.net. Recurly retains our clients’ personal information, including credit card information.
Our merchant processing company is Chase Paymentech. Chase retains personal information, and does not retain the credit card information.
Storage of Information:
Profiles:
