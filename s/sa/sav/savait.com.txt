This storage allows us to create our websites and our offers according to your needs and facilitate the use of the website. For example, some data are stored to avoid their repetition each time.
Which cookies does WEBSITE OWNER use?
The most part of the cookies we use are deleted when the browser is closed (end of session) automatically by your hard disk (this is why they are called session-cookies). Session-cookies offer you, for instance, the "cart" function even if you are browsing different pages. Moreover, we also use cookies which remain in your hard disk. When you will return to our web page, the system will automatically detect that you have already visited us and it will store data and preferred settings. These temporary cookies or even permanent (duration from 1 month to 10 years) are stored in your hard disk and deleted after a fixed period. These cookies are mainly necessary to make our offer easier, more efficient and safer for users. Thanks to these files for instance it is possible to display information which best fit your interests. The only aim of cookies is to adapt our offer to your needs as a customer and to make your browsing more comfortable.
Which data are stored in cookies?
The cookies used by WEBSITE OWNER do not store personal data. As a consequence, the cookies we use cannot be attributed to a specific person and then they cannot lead to you. When cookies are accepted, an identification code is generated. Your personal data will never be connected to the identification code and there will be no attempt to do that. Your name, your IP address and similar data which may be attributed to you will never be used. Based on the cookies technology, we only receive information as an alias, for example in relation to which pages of our online store are visited the most, which products are viewed the most, etc.
What is OnsiteTargeting?
Based on cookies technology, WEBSITE OWNER website collects data to optimize our business proposals and our range of online products. These data are not used to identify you personally, but they exclusively allow assessing the use of the homepage as an alias. Your data will be never connected with your personal data stored. This technology enables us to submit you promotional offers and/or specific offers and services, whose content is based on the information obtained through the clickstream analysis. Our goal is to make our online offer interesting and to submit you commercial offers which reflect your interests.
Are there also third-party-cookies?

Then, when you visit our website, cookies of associated companies will be stored in your hard disk as well.

Such temporary or also permanent cookies (their duration ranges from 14 days to 10 years) are stored in your hard disk and automatically deleted at the expiration of the predefined period. Even cookies of associated companies do not contain personal data. Through a user ID data can be collected only as a pseudonym. For example, we talk about data connected to the products viewed, if you have purchased something, which products you have looked for etc… During this process, some of our advertising partners also get information about which pages you have already visited, or in which products you are interested, in order to show you a promotional offer which fits your interests at best. These data as a pseudonym will never be related with your personal data. They only have the purpose of helping our advertising partners to confront you with promotional offers which may actually be of interest for you.
