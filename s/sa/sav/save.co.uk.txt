What Information Do We Collect?
When you visit the Site, you may provide us with two types of information: information you actively choose to disclose ("Active Information") and information collected in a way not visible to you on an aggregate, anonymous basis as you and others browse our Site ("Passive Information").
When we refer to "personal information" we mean information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, or email address. Sharing personal information with us is entirely optional.

The Site is not intended for use by anyone under 18, except with the explicit permission and under the supervision of a parent or guardian who accepts full legal responsibility for the minor's use. No person under 13 should disclose information on this Site. We don't knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us at the email address provided below to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities.

Passive Information We Collect
Our Site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our Site is used. Passive Information gathered may include your Internet service provider, browser type, operating system, the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the sites visited just before and just after our Site. Passive Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you remain anonymous. If you do not wish to transmit "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult the "Help" section of your browser to correctly do so. If you elect to turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain features of the Site and your use of some portions of the Site may be affected.
What is a Cookie?
Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (Europe) has produced a series of web pages (see http://www.allaboutcookies.org) which explain how cookies work and how they can be managed.
How Do We Use the Information Collected?

Any Active Information retained would be used to assist the delivery of the content, features, advertising, services, or information you requested, and to optimize your experience and enhance the quality of the time you spend with us online. We may use the Active Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to our Site, new services, features or products we offer, or other information we think you will find valuable.

We also may share web site usage information about visitors to our Site with third parties, such as advertisers on our Site, for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Site and other sites. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising companies may place pixel tags (also called clear gifs) on some of the pages you visit on our Site. We will then use the information that is collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to specific searches you conducted on Save.co.uk ****during earlier browsing sessions.
