We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what “personally identifiable information” (PII) we may collect and how it may be used. This statement only applies to www.savoryexperiments.com.
We may use the information collected in the following ways:

What information do we collect and how do we use it?
Information you voluntarily submit to our website:
We may collect PII such as name or email address when you sign up for our newsletter, leave a comment or complete a contact form.
Automatically Collected Information:
Like most websites, we collect basic PII and the device you use to access our Website. For example, when you visit our website, it logs your IP address, location, operating system, referring website, pages you viewed, dates and times accessed and type of device you used to access. We may also collect information on the information you view while here, such as links you click on.
Cookies:
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
Like most websites, we use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you voluntarily choose to share with us.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies, if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
Advertising:
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers, although if you’ve updated your personal web browser settings, this should prevent them from being seen.
We use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website, including MediaVine. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data.
The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Savory Experiments disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or demographic information collected from cookies. An example would be the Website telling a third party that the majority of it’s viewers are female or located in the United States.
