Privacy Policy - Vista Outdoor
This Privacy Policy applies to Vista Outdoor Inc. and Vista Outdoor Sales LLC, as well as our subsidiaries and affiliates and our trusted family of brands (collectively, “Vista Outdoor”).  Vista Outdoor has created this Policy to let you know we take your privacy seriously. This Policy explains our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected from our websites, online applications, kiosks, mobile applications, email, telephone inquiries, promotions, warranty registrations, newsletter service, surveys, forums, sweepstakes/contest entries, Idea Exchange, ratings and review service, social media sites and the websites hosted by our service providers and merchant associates (collectively, the “Services”).
Types of Information Collected.
When using our Services, we may collect (ourselves or through our trusted service providers or business associates) your name, age, gender, company name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, zip code and credit card information (“Personal Information”).  We may also collect other information that you submit or disclose in connection with the Services, such as product interests, reviews, feedback, testimonials, ideas, postings, submissions, photographs, diagrams, drawings, plans, notes, suggestions, inventions, creative materials, videos, designs, and other information (“User-Generated Content”).
Vista Outdoor may, directly or through a third party, collect information about you and your use of our Services whenever you use the Services.  For instance, we may collect various forms of information such as entry and exit points for our Services ( i.e., referring URLs or domains), Services traffic statistics, operating system and browser type (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Services. In addition, when you request pages on our Services, our servers automatically log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Vista Outdoor may store some information on your computer in the form of a “cookie” or similar file to help us maintain and improve these Services in many ways. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. With most Internet browsers, you can erase “cookies” from your computer hard drive, block all “cookies,” or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. Enabling cookies allows you to take full advantage of all the features on the Services and we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you elect to block the cookies, we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience on our Services. We may also include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site(s), and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
In some instances, Vista Outdoor may use tracking scripts or “tracers” that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by Vista Outdoor solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit certain web pages where Vista Outdoor may have placed a banner ad. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of the Internet unrelated to Vista Outdoor. Please note that Vista Outdoor does not use tracers to identify your personal information, and you remain anonymous unless and until you communicate with Vista Outdoor.
The Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from the Services from visitors in this age group. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites. Parents can also select “Personal Information / Opt Out” at our Contact Us page to access, change, or delete the personal information that has been submitted by a child.
Use of Information Collected.
Vista Outdoor may use Personal Information to send you information about us and our products, including news and promotional material, to solicit information from you, to provide a response or confirmation to an order placed on our merchant site(s) and for marketing research. We may use your Personal Information to customize the Services and display content that we think you might be interested in according to your preferences.  We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website.
