Who We Are
We are Moran Foods, LLC, operating under the brand name SAVE A LOT (“Save A Lot,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to the websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (we call these the “Sites”).
Independent Stores
We also have licensing and wholesale relationships with a network of independent retailers that independently own and operate their grocery stores (“ Independent Stores ”), but who license the use of our brand name and/or use our wholesale distribution network.
Some Independent Stores may operate their own websites or mobile applications, separate and apart from the Site. Those websites and mobile applications are not operated by us and are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Please review the privacy policy posted on those websites or mobile applications to understand the applicable information practices.
How We Collect and Use Personal Information
When we use the term “ Personal Information ” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information that we directly associate with a specific person, or that reasonably can be used to identify a specific person.  For example, this includes your name, home address, phone number, email address, birthday and any other information that we tie to these elements.
Personal Information does not include “aggregated information,” which is information that we collect about a group or category of persons or services.  It also does not include “de-identified information,” which is information from which we or our agents have removed information that can be used to specifically identify a person. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection, use, or disclosure of aggregated or de-identified information.
We collect the following types of Personal Information when you use our Site:
1. Information You Provide
We collect Personal Information you provide, for example when you enter the information into form fields on our Sites or enroll in our Smart Shopper Club program.  For example, we may collect:
contact information, such as your name, home address, and email address, which we use to communicate with you and authenticate you as a user;
demographic information, including age, product preferences, preferred store location and other interests and likes, which we use to better understand and analyze our customer population, support our operations including inventory and product management, to deliver relevant offers and ads, and to improve our products and services including the Site;
communications preferences, including marketing preferences, which we  use to manage how we engage with you;
application information related to becoming an owner of an Independent Store;
the content of inquiries you make.
2. Information Collected Automatically
We use various technologies to collect other types of data that do not directly reveal your identity (“ Other Information ”).  If we associate Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
These technologies include the following:
Logging Functionality: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data.  We generally only use this data for purposes such as security, fraud detection, and protecting our rights.
Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies: We and third parties we work with use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track information about you and your activities online over time and across different websites.  In addition, we use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and how you interact with the Site. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience, and analyze the use of our Site and solutions to make them more useful to you. These technologies also allow us to aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information, which may or may not include Personal Information, and provide this information to our service providers.
Most Internet browsers allow you to remove or manage cookie functions and adjust your privacy and security preferences.  For information on how to do this, access the “help” menu on your Internet browser, or visit http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies/.  Please note, however, that disabling our cookies may result in your inability to take full advantage of all of the features of the Site. To manage Flash cookies please visit Adobe’s website.
Analytics :  We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics to help us evaluate and measure the use and performance of our Site.  To opt out of the aggregation and analysis of data collected about you on our website by Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
3. Information We Obtain from Third Party Sources
We may receive additional Personal Information from third party sources that we may append to existing consumer information, such as email and mailing address verification.  We use this supplemental information to better understand our consumers, deliver relevant offers and advertising, and improve our operations, stores, Site and our advertising and marketing campaigns.
**4. Location Information  **
We may collect location information through the Site so we can offer you certain location-based services (such as delivering advertisements that are relevant to your particular location, and conducting analytics to improve our stores and the Site).
We may use various technologies, including IP lookup, to detect your location so that we can automatically show you the closest store to your area, rather than some random location. Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the website would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected and you must manually enter your location.
