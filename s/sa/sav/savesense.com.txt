We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:
a. The first type of information is non-personally identifiable information pertaining to a User, which may be made available or gathered via the User's use of SaveSense (“Non-personal Information”).

b. The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, or may be of private or sensitive nature (“Personal Information”).
Personal Information which is being gathered consists of the following:

For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists. We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained, inter alia, through your active acceptance to the Terms and this Privacy Policy.
3. How Do We Collect Information on Our Users?
There are two main methods we use:
