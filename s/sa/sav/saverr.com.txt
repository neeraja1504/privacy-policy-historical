Use of cookies
When your web browser accesses a specific web site such as ours, cookies (a type of small file) may, depending on your browser settings, be automatically stored on your computer's hard drive.
Cookies may be set by us, an affiliate network, or a retailer on both Saverr.com and retailer sites. When you go through to make a purchase on a retailer’s site it’s the cookie that gives us the information to track your cashback. Specifically it tells us which retailer’s site you’ve clicked through to and when. If you’ve made a purchase the cookie tells us the time you made it and the cashback amount. In some cases it may also record the product(s) (or type of product(s)) purchased and the value of the purchase.
How we use cookie information
The cookie information allows us to calculate and allocate you the correct amount of cashback for your purchase. It also allows us to present tailored offers to you when you’re on Saverr.
We also put all the cookie information together anonymously (so your identity and personal details are not accessible) and use it for internal management purposes. We may share this information with current or prospective retailers as it really helps in negotiating better cashback rates. This will always be done at an aggregate level and no personal data will ever be shared.
Managing your cookies
You can find out how to manage and remove cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.
If however you set your browser to reject cookies you may not be able to use certain aspects of Saverr and will not be able to earn cashback since theres no way for us to track the transaction.
