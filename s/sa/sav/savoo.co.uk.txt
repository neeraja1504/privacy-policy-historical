If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

With whom your Information may be shared
Savoo does not sell trade or rent your personal information to other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
Contests and Other Promotions – From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. If you enter one of these contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you’ll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can administer and operate the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion (including contacting you if you win, fulfilling a prize, and publishing a winners’ list). If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to our co-sponsor(s) as described below, please do not enter the contest, sweepstakes or promotion.

If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us. See “Updating your Information” below.
Mobile Applications and Location-Based Information – Savoo may have the ability to use your geographic location to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location. If you choose to enable Savoo to use your location information, then that information will be stored and used to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location.

We may use this information to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location.
Vendors  – We sometimes disclose the information we collect to companies that host certain services for us such as marketing distribution services on our behalf. These vendors only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit them from using the information except to market the specified Savoo products or services.
As Permitted by Law  – We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Savoo’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfer  – As with any other business, it is possible that Savoo, Inc. in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Savoo, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy policy unless you consent otherwise. We will provide notice in this instance as defined in our “Changes to this Privacy Policy” section below.
Cookies and IP Addresses –  To serve you faster and with better quality, we use “cookies” technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to “personalize” itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or “click-stream”) data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used Savoo. Cookies are not tied to your personal information. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner’s web sites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our web site This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. We also allow select third-parties to set cookies on our website. For example, we use a tracking service, Revenue Science, that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors. This aggregate visitor usage information collected on Savoo and used by the Revenue Science network for the purposes of delivering relevant advertising to our audience. Other examples include session cookies when accessing the Blog section of the website. These cookies simply track the session and are not tied to your personal information. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.
Clear Gifs – We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from our homepage. ** **
Confidentiality and Security
The security of your personal information is very important at Savoo and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example: We limit access to personal information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing requested products and services to you.
