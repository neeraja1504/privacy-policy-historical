Job applicants may choose not to provide Personal Information to Sanmina.
However, to the extent it is not supplied, Sanmina would not be able to assess the
suitability of such persons for employment and therefore to employ such persons.
Similarly, we would not be able to enter into agreements with independent
contractors who do not provide us with the Personal Information needed in order to
retain them and pay them for their services.
c. Temporary Workers (employed by staffing agencies or other third parties)
Sanmina collects only limited personal information from temporary workers
who are employed by staffing agencies or other third parties and who are assigned by
such third parties to work at our facilities. Should such persons not provide such
information to Sanmina, we would not be able to permit them to work at our facilities
or to access our IT systems.
d. Consent
Where required by law, we obtain your consent for the processing of sensitive
Personal Information. If we rely on consent for the processing of your Personal
Information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When
you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent
withdrawal.

In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to (1) request access and
receive information about the Personal Information Sanmina maintains about you, (2)
update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, (3) restrict or object to
the processing of your Personal Information, (4) have the information blocked,

have the same data protection laws as the country in which in which the data was
originally collected. Regardless of where Sanmina stores, processes or transfers
Personal Information, it will protect that information as described in this Policy. If
you are located in the European Economic Area, we comply with applicable legal
-8-
requirements to provide adequate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information
to countries other than the country where you are located. We may transfer Personal
Information to countries for which adequacy decisions have been issued, use
contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information, such as the European
Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses, or rely on third parties’ certification to
