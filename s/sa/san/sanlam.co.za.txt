If requested, you may choose to give us your personal information, for example your name and address or email addresses. This information may be needed, for example, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription.
Sanlam will advise you how it will use personal information before it collects the personal information from you. If you inform Sanlam that you do not want it to use your personal information as a basis for further contact with you or for any other purpose, it will not do so.
