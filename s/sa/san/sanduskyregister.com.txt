Automatically Collected Information
We obtain and retain certain information automatically when you interact with our Site, emails, and online advertising.  We use this information to enhance our services, create a more personalized experience, evaluate the operation and use of our Site, and to support our marketing campaigns.  When you access and interact with the Site, we may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.  We may collect this information using “cookies” and other website technologies (i.e., browser pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology).
“Cookies” and other website technologies are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.  Websites, apps, and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to manage, control, and delete cookies in the Help section of the toolbar. You can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  You can also manually delete cookies from your computers.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content, or personalization available through the Site.
Third parties that support the Site by providing services, such as tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. TANDEM MEDIA NETWORK does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
Information from other Sources
