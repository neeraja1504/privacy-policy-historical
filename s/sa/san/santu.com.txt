We take your privacy seriously.
We respect and protect the privacy of any information you provide about yourself on this website or in our apps.
This applies also to any information you collect with our apps by using functions such as cameras and microphones integrated in Internet access devices such as laptop computers, mobile phones and tablets.
We do not rent, sell, share or give your personal information to any third parties, unless you explicitly approve of or initiate such an action, for example by publishing product photos you have  taken.
Your information will only be passed on to affiliated companies if this is required to provide you with products or services which you have specifically requested.
However we may release your data if this is required by a legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
While we use some cookies on our website, these are only used to track general anonymous website traffic and to keep track of orders generated via our network of affiliates so we can pay commissions.
