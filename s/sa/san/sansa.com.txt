Information we collect
We collect different types of information, including personal information. "Personal information" is information that can be used to identify you, including name, title, occupation, postal or physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other information required to carry out a transaction, provide a service or deliver a product you have requested. Depending on where you are based, personal information may also include your Internet Protocol (IP) address and other information related to your computer, or an opinion you have expressed. We collect and store community discussions, chats, correspondence through our Sites and correspondence sent to us.
We will not collect sensitive information about you (such as information about your health or medical history, ethnic origin, political or religious beliefs, trade union or professional association memberships, sexual orientation, or criminal record) except with your consent or where its collection is required by law.
The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you with a product or service, communicate with you, or maintain our relationship with you. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not be able to provide these things to you, in part or at all.
We also collect other, non-personal types of information about you and analyze it in order to improve our products and services, and to personalize your experience with us. This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer and connection information such as browser type, version and time zone setting, operating system, and platform; product registration history, which we may aggregate with other information; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our websites including date and time; cookie number; and the products you viewed or searched for.
Much of the personal information we collect is collected online, but we also collect personal information off-line such as through customer service call centers, at in-person events, and through postal mail (such as rebate or warranty cards you mail in to us).
To offer you a more personalized experience with SanDisk, information collected through one SanDisk service may be combined with information collected through another SanDisk service.
Cookies, web beacons and other technologies we use
We use cookies (small files placed on your hard drive), web beacons, website analytics tools, and the personal information you provide us to personalize your online experience and improve our services.
For example, we use a cookie to remember the country or language preferences you selected on our web site. This saves you time, since you are not required to re-enter the same information each time you visit our site. Other cookies are "session cookies" which means that they are deleted automatically from your hard drive at the end of your browsing session on our Sites. You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the Sites that we do not control. For example, when you buy SanDisk products online through the SanDisk Store our ecommerce vendor may use cookies. You can modify your browser settings to control whether your computer accepts or declines cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain interactive features of our Sites. Note that you can always go back and delete cookies from your browser; however, that means that any settings or preferences controlled by those cookies will also be deleted and you may need to recreate them.
SanDisk Sites may contain web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that may be used to help deliver cookies on our Sites and allow us to track the number of visitors who have visited those pages. We may also include web beacons or cookies in promotional email messages so we can track whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Finally, we may use web beacons or cookies, or use third party web beacons or cookies, to help us compile aggregate, anonymous statistical information about the effectiveness of our Sites' operations or promotional campaigns.
As noted above, we collect information about you and analyze it in order to improve our products and services, and to personalize your experience with us. This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer and connection information such as browser type, version and time zone setting, operating system, and platform; product registration history, which we may aggregate with other information; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our Sites including date and time; cookie number; and the products you viewed or searched for. In instances where this includes use of personal data, this use will be in accordance with the consent you have given, or otherwise in accordance with applicable laws.
Use of personal information
We will not collect any personal information from you if you have not given us the requisite consent to do so. We will tell you why we wish to collect the personal information, and we will only use your personal information in the way and for the purposes we told you about when we collected it. We will not change the way in which your personal information is used unless we have your consent to do so.
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a positive and customized experience with us. You agree that we may use your personal information:
To deliver a product or provide a service you have requested;
To provide you with product registration, technical and customer support;
To administer promotions you enter such as a contest or sweepstakes;
To allow your participation in activities, such as online discussion groups, communities, and surveys;
To send you communications of interest that you have requested, such as emails or text messages about SanDisk (including the SanDisk Group Companies), our products and services, targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers;
To customize, measure and improve our products, services, content, and advertising;
To personalize your overall experience with SanDisk; and
To transfer to SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized Third Parties as described below.
Our use of personal data for marketing purposes is subject to your rights, which may be exercised without charge to withdraw your permission.
SanDisk will not use any government identifier to identify you (such as a Social Security Number, Tax ID number, or Medicare number). We will use and disclose these numbers and identifiers only for the purposes required or permitted by applicable law.
Sharing personal information
Unless we have your permission to do so, we do not rent or sell your personal information to third parties. SanDisk does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
By submitting your personal information to us, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to parties under the following circumstances:
We may share your personal information within SanDisk Corporation in the US or any of our parent/affiliate/subsidiary companies worldwide ("SanDisk Group Companies"), to guide decisions about their products, services and communications.
We may share your personal information with authorized third parties (such as our vendors) who help with our business operations, including the storage and processing of personal data for the uses listed in this policy ("Authorized Third Parties"). We provide Authorized Third Parties only with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service. We do not allow Authorized Third Parties to use your personal information for any other purpose.
We require that the SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized Third Parties adhere to procedures at least as restrictive as the procedures we follow ourselves, including this privacy policy.
We may need to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, and/or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We may disclose personal information and other information available to us when we believe, in our sole discretion, disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SanDisk's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
If SanDisk should file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if SanDisk should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, we may be required to disclose your personal information, including information you have allowed us to see or use in your record, to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions consistent with applicable data protection law.
Please remember that any information you choose to disclose in public areas of the SanDisk Sites (such as community forums or published product reviews) will become public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in public areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information.

Security of personal information
We appreciate your trust in sharing your personal information with us, and we are committed to protecting it. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
By way of example, access to personal information is restricted to those employees, contractors and agents of SanDisk who need to know such data to perform their assigned functions and develop or improve our products and services. Also, we store personal information you may provide to us on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. Also, if we were to transmit particularly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we would protect the information through the use of encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
We have legal obligations to protect the security of your personal data. Despite our efforts, there remains the possibility that information may be accessed, altered, disclosed, or destroyed due to a security breach. In the event of a security breach, if our investigations indicate that there could be significant harm to you as a result of such unauthorized access or disclosure we will promptly notify you and the proper authorities. We also encourage you to take precautions to protect your personal information when you are online. Create strong passwords by using a combination of letters and numbers when creating them, change passwords often, and use a secure browser.
Data retention
SanDisk will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary to honor your choices, fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by applicable laws and regulations (which, for example, may require us to retain certain transactional data). Your personal information will be destroyed or permanently de-identified in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For example, when the information is printed on paper it will be deleted/destroyed by shredding or incineration; where the information is stored electronically, it will be deleted by technical means to render the information unusable.
Links to other websites and social media platforms
Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites or social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube, which are outside of our control and are not covered by this privacy policy. Although we occasionally review the content of these third-party websites, in general we do not do so, and therefore we do not accept any responsibility for their content. You should review the privacy policies posted on these other sites.
Children and privacy
SanDisk does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are a minor in your country of residence, you may use SanDisk Sites and our services only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. For example, in the United States SanDisk does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we inadvertently have collected personal information from a minor under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems.
Transfer of personal information, Safe Harbor
We may transfer your personal information to SanDisk Corporation in the US or to any SanDisk Group Companies worldwide, or to Authorized Third Parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing, storage or fulfillment. The SanDisk Group Companies and Authorized Third Parties who may receive your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and the databases in which your personal information is stored may be located at facilities located across the world and not necessarily in the country in which you are located.
If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States to SanDisk Corporation and to other countries where the SanDisk Group Companies operate, whose privacy laws may be less strict. By providing your personal information you consent to that transfer.
SanDisk participates in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor principles for online, off-line and manually processed personal information. For more information about the Safe Harbor program, click here .
