Information Collection and Use
SanDiego.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SanDiego.com collects information from our users at several different points on our web site:
Registration
In order to use this web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.
Order
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill a customer's order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings that take place. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We process all orders in-house, and we use Wells Fargo Bank to bill credit card users for goods and services. Wells Fargo does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Links
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, TopLevel Corp., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
Email Newsletter
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information (such as name and e-mail address), for the purpose of sending the newsletter and no other secondary purpose.

Surveys & Contests
From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's name and e-mail address. SanDiego.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting the friend to visit the site. SanDiego.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact SanDiego.com or info@sandiego.com to request the removal of this information from their database.
Security
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and offline.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page (such as our order form), the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer), becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just "surfing". To learn more about SSL, follow this link: http://www.rsasecurity.com/standards/protocols/ssl_tls.html.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Our employees must use password-protected screensavers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to your information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an e-mail to info@sandiego.com .
Special Offers
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communication. Please see our choice and opt out below.

Site and Service Updates
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.
Correction/Updating Personal Information:
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by e-mailing our Customer Support at info@sandiego.com .
Choice/Opt Out
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-out" mechanism, so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off our lists.
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt out of receiving these communications by sending email to us at .'; document.write( '' ); document.write( addy_text5993 ); document.write( '<\/a>' ); //-->\n
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party or not.

Privacy Statement
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
