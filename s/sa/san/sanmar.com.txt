DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
SanMar does not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease personal information shared to our representatives, collected on our website or included in our email lists to any third party. We will only use the personal information that you provide for the reason that you provided it to SanMar. For example, if you provide us with a shipping address we may use that personal information to create a shipping label. We may also share certain personal information with vendors or service providers that SanMar uses to service its customers. For example, a shipping address may be shared with the carrier used to deliver the package to you. SanMar may also share your personal information with vendors that help us provide you with services and help us provide you with an excellent customer experience. SanMar’s third party vendors only have access to your personal data for a short period of time. SanMar makes best efforts to be sure that its vendors are contractually obligated to carefully handle data received from SanMar and to delete it after a reasonable period of time.

GDPR RIGHTS
European Union data subjects have certain rights related to personal information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation. If you qualify, it is your right to request (a) access to your personal information; (b) data correction to your personal information is incorrect or incomplete; (c) object to SanMar’s use of your personal information because there is a strong legitimate reason that we should not process your personal information that is unique to you; or (d) SanMar’s deletion of your personal information. If you provided us with consent related to your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time.

DATA SECURITY
We take precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Please note that our data security precautions are not a guarantee that that data will not be subject to unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction if our safety precautions are breached.

If for any reason you believe that SanMar has not adhered to these privacy principles or you wish to object to or withdraw previously provided consent to process your personal information, please notify us by e-mail at customertechsupport@sanmar.com and we will endeavor to review and promptly correct the problem. Please use the words 'Privacy Policy' in the subject line.
EXTERNAL LINKS
This website provides links to various websites that SanMar does not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our website and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between our website and a third party website, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection practices and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to our site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.
INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS
Any personally identifiable information that you provide to SanMar will be collected directly on servers located in the United States and maintained on servers located in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, this means that any information you provide will be transferred abroad.
