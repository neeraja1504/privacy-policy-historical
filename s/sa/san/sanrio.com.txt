When users come to the Site, we collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each user to the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we can determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
We also use Cookies to help us determine the type of content and sites to which a user to the Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of the Site and the specific functionality that users choose to use. Essentially, Cookies are a user's identification card for the Sanrio.com servers. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at the Site.
