Data Protection, Privacy and Cookies | Data Protection, Privacy and Cookies | University of Salford, Manchester
Here at the University of Salford we work hard to ensure that you get the very best experience, whether you are a visitor, a student, a staff-member, alumni or partner, without having to worry if your information is safe.
Outlined below is how & why we collect, use, & share your personal information, & your rights in relation to that data.
We know that there’s lots of information here, but we want you to be fully informed – we hope the following sections will answer any questions you have but if not, please do get in touch with us.
A bit about Us
The University of Salford is the “Data Controller” of your personal data & is subject to the data protection legislation & to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (“GDPR”). We are registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) registration number Z469563X and our Data Protection Officer is Andrew Hartley.
Privacy
We appreciate an individual’s right to privacy & in all situations we strive to achieve a balance between protecting that right & confirming that we have the correct information to ensure we can provide an exceptional experience for all.
Under the GDPR a number of new principles mean that individuals have greater rights concerning their information & how it is used (see Data Subject Rights) We have detailed an overview of these principles below & included the Privacy Statements for all groups of people who the University of Salford interact with.
The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which an organisation may collect & process your personal data, including:
Public Task
To ensure that we meet carry out our role as an institute of higher education & provide our Students with required level of service we need to collect & process relevant personal data.
For example, when we record your academic results & validate with your previous Further Education provider.
Consent
In specific situations, we can collect & process your data with your consent.
For example, if you are a Graduate and you tick a box to receive email enquiring if you wish to become a donor.
Contract
In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.
For example, when you accept a place at the University we need to capture certain information in order to provide you with the place & service.
Legal compliance
If the law requires us to, we may need to collect & process your data.
For example, certain government departments need us to collect and pass on statistical data.
Legitimate interest
In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running the University which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, after you graduate, we will send you email newsletters updating you on what is happening here at the University.
When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.
Here are some examples of when we collect your information, for further details please take a look at the relevant Privacy Policy.
When you visit our website
When you engage with us on social media
If you join us as a Student or Staff member we need to capture data in order to enter into a contract with you
If your image is captured on the CCTV that we deploy across our sites for safety & security
When a donation or a purchase is made
When an individual attends a clinic run by one of the University Schools
Under the GDPR we are only permitted to collect the minimum amount of information needed to carry out a specific purpose, therefore depending on your relationship with us we collect different amounts of data.
Example, if you are making a decision about university choices & want some information sending to you we would only take your name & contact details (address & email) but if you are joining us as a member of Staff we would need more information, such as date of birth, gender, financial details.
If your relationship with us changes, we remove all unnecessary information that we hold on you.
Example, after Graduation, when you become an Alumni, we no longer need information on attendance or financial details so we will delete these & only retain details that enable us to perform Alumni activity, such as contact details, information on your degree, when you attended the University & details that help us shape our Alumni programme.
Different information is processed for different purposes, some of it is used to improve experience, such as Cookies on the website & other information helps us track performance, comply with legislation or help keep you informed of what is happening here at the University of Salford.
Detailed information about how we use information for different purposes can be found in the relevant Privacy Policies, but here are some examples:
Website Cookies tell us which pages you find useful, & therefore how we can improve your experience online
We collect & report upon sensitive personal data, such as gender, ethic origin & disability data in order to undertake equal opportunity monitoring
We require financial data to administer financial activity, such as fees, scholarships & bursaries
We take photographs in order to issue Access Passes
Information captured during Research projects will be processed in order to develop our programmes & insight
Data is retained for as long as it is required to perform its purpose, or for as long as is required by law. At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis & business planning.

Sometimes we share your personal data with trusted third parties, in order to meet our contractual needs or to improve our services.
Here’s the policy we apply to those organisations to keep your data safe & protect your privacy:
We provide only the information they need to perform their specific services
They may only use your data for the exact purposes we specify in our contract with them
We work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected & protected at all times
If we stop using their services, all of your data held by them will either be deleted or rendered anonymous

Whenever you have given us your consent to use your personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time & withdraw that consent.
You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for direct marketing activity through all channels, or selected channels. We must always comply with your request.
In cases where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our contract with you, public task or for a legitimate interest, you can ask us to stop for reasons connected to your individual situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have an overriding reason to continue processing your personal data, if this is the case we will advise you of the reason.

Data Protection
The GDPR, building on previous data protection legislation, gives people the right to know what information is held about them & requires the University to ensure that personal information relating to living individuals is handled properly, held in confidence & is protected from inappropriate disclosure to third parties.
It provides a comprehensive & modern framework for data protection in the UK. and will give people more control over use of their data, provide new rights to move or delete personal data & impose stronger sanctions for malpractice.
Everyone who collects & manages personal information at the University of Salford must do so in a way that complies with the University's Policy on Data Protection, https://www.salford.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/316733/DataProtectionPolicyV2.0.pdf the 6 principles, and the new Individual Rights under GDPR.
