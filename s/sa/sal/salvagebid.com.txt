Salvagebid takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information. However, no data transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures Salvagebid takes to protect your personal information:
Secure Socket Layer Encryption: Â Salvagebid uses Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption when transmitting certain kinds of personal information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time Salvagebid asks you for a credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Salvagebid, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.
Vendors and Partners: Â Salvagebid works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.
Employee and Contractor Access to Information: Â Salvagebid limits access to your personal information to those employees who Salvagebid reasonably believes need to come into contact with that information to provide you with use of and access to Salvagebid's Services.
Education and Training for Employees: Â Salvagebid has implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every Salvagebid employee.
