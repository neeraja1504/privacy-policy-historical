Place of data processing and authorized personnel
Data processing relating to the services on these websites takes place at the premises of the Internet service providers used to make and host the site and at the Data Controller’s premises.
Data is processed only by authorized personnel, including for any maintenance and administration of the processing systems.
Types of processed data
Navigation and technically essential data
During the course of normal operation, the computer systems and software procedures used to operate this website collect personal data, the transmission of which is an intrinsic part of using Internet communication protocols. Such information is not collected to be associated with identified parties, but could, by its very nature, make it possible to identify users when processed and associated with data held by third parties. This data category includes IP addresses or the domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the website, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) addresses of requested resources, the time of the request, the method used to place the request with the server, the size of the file obtained in reply, the numeric code indicating the status of the reply given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and to the user’s IT environment. This data is only used to obtain anonymous statistical data relating to use of the website and to check that it is operating correctly, and is immediately deleted after processing. The data could be used to determine responsibility in the event of hypothetical IT offenses against the website.
Data provided voluntarily by the user
Data relating to identified or identifiable persons may also be processed, on the basis of additional information submitted by the party concerned: for example, by filling in data collection forms; or through the optional, explicit and voluntary sending of e-mail to the addresses appearing on this site, involving the sender’s address subsequently being acquired, which is necessary to reply to requests, and any other personal data included in the communication.
E-commerce data
Data processed to manage shop orders includes personal details, addresses, purchase notes, recommendations and notes.
Profiling data
Profiling data regarding the interested party’s shopping habits or choices is not directly collected. It is still possible that this information may be collected by independent or separate parties through links or the inclusion of third-party elements. Refer to the Cookies section.
Cookies
Like other websites, this website saves cookies in the browser of the user’s computer to transmit personal information and to enhance the user experience. Cookies are small text files that are sent to the user’s terminal equipment (usually the browser) by visited websites, where they are stored, sometimes for a long time, to be then resent to the same websites on the user’s next visit.
As explained below, it is possible to choose to accept cookies or not and which cookies to accept, bearing in mind that refusing to use them may affect the ability to complete certain transactions on the website or the accuracy and suitability of certain customizable content or the ability to recognize the user from one visit to the next. Where no choice is made in this regard, the predefined settings will be applied and all cookies will be activated. However, relevant decisions may be notified or changed at any time.
In particular, “session” cookies are used, which are not stored permanently on the user’s computer and are deleted on closing the browser, use of which is strictly limited to the transmission of session identifiers (consisting of numbers randomly generated by the server), which are necessary to enable secure and efficient browsing of the site and which avoid the use of other IT techniques that would potentially jeopardize the confidentiality of users’ browsing and do not allow the collection of personal data that could identify the user. Analytics cookies are also used, which help understand how visitors interact with the site’s content, by collecting information (geographical and web location, technology used, language, landing page, pages visited, exit page, time spent on the site, etc.) and generating website usage statistics, without personally identifying individual visitors. All these are technical cookies, which, as consent is not required, operate on an opt-out basis. Technical cookies are not shared with third parties, as they are necessary or useful for the functioning of the site. They are therefore only processed by authorized qualified persons, data processors or system administrators.
Lastly, the site includes cookies from third parties (which are independent and for which the Data Controller has no responsibility), which also perform profiling functions.
For information about these, refer to the respective sites:

Some people prefer not to allow cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you. In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy. What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.
Another feature of some browsers is incognito browsing mode, meaning that any cookies created while in incognito mode are deleted after the browser is closed.
Refer to the following instructions for cookie management in the relevant browsers:

Purposes of processing, communication and disclosure of data
The personal data collected is only used to perform the requested services and is disclosed to third parties only when necessary for that purpose. Services include: browsing and simple use of the website and its content; registration and access to the restricted area; donations and payments; subscription to and receipt of the newsletter; recommendations; contact requests, etc.
Some services involve more detailed information.
In any case, no data derived from web services is disclosed or published without the prior approval of the party concerned.
Finally, please note that in some cases (not subject to ordinary management) the Public Authorities may also request personal information, to which the Data Controller is obliged to respond.
Optional provision of data
Apart from what is required in terms of navigation and technically essential data, the user is free to provide personal data for specific requests regarding products and/or services. Without certain essential data it may be impossible to fulfill the request.
Management of approval for processing
When necessary and, in any case, after having read the policy, the interested party is required to consent to the processing and disclosure of their personal data for the purposes and within the limits described; failure to do so would prevent the Data Controller from processing the data in order to perform and provide the services requested by the interested party.

Leaders Area
This is a restricted area that is accessible only after prior authentication, exclusively for use by authorized and appointed persons. Unauthorized access to this area or remaining in it will be prosecuted (Article 615b of the Penal Code) and constitute an administrative liability offense on the part of the body (Article 24a of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001) for which the offender works. Authorized users acknowledge that, in this area, technical cookies (session, security, navigation cookies, etc.) are used in the user’s browser, which cannot be refused in order for the site to work correctly. The primarily automated processing of user data (authentication credentials, access and attempted access logs, operation logs, etc.) falls within the scope of the Data Controller’s IT system management and is regulated and described in detail in the internal IT procedures. Data is stored temporarily, is not disclosed and may be accessed, when necessary, by technical personnel (developers and system administrators), unless necessary for other legitimate purposes as laid down by the Personal Data Protection Code. Information (text, video and images) that the user uploads to the restricted area is protected by encryption and authentication systems and can be accessed only by authorized users, or by parties with a direct interest and/or intermediaries involved. This information is not disclosed.
