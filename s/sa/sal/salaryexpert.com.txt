This web site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other
regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note
that you are transferring your personal data to the United States, which does not have the same
data protection laws as the EU. By providing your personal data, you consent to:
   The use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.
   The transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.

Aggregate Information:
Clickstream and Demographic Information. ERI may collect Clickstream Information about you
and your use of our Site whenever you visit the Site. For instance, we may collect information
such as entry and exit points for the Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), Site traffic statistics,
page views, impressions, operating system, and browser type. In addition, when users request
webpages on the Site, ERI's servers automatically log the IP address of each user. An IP address
is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the World
Wide Web.
Clickstream Information and Demographic Information may be aggregated for usage, sales, and
marketing purposes ("Aggregate Information"). When ERI aggregates such information, ERI
compiles the information in a manner that describes the purchases or characteristics of users of
the Site generally, but does not individually identify any specific user, activity, or transaction. ERI
may also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to the Site from affiliate websites and
the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is similarly aggregated and is not tied
to an individual purchase.
ERI may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any
and all Aggregate Information. Should ERI share such information with other companies, it is not
traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. Should ERI correlate any
Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information
under this policy. In rare circumstances, ERI may use such information to identify a user when
necessary to enforce compliance with an agreement between ERI and the user, to comply with
law enforcement requests, or to protect ERI's Site(s) or other users.
Cookies. ERI may make use of "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small text files stored on a
user's computer by a web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A
cookie itself is neither designed nor intended to read any information from a user's computer
(other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the website that originally
placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the
same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use
of a website based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the
user's computer to the websites, which may correlate other information, including personally
identifying information, with the cookie.
ERI utilizes cookies in order to automate access and data entry functions of the Site such as
correlating online ordering information, tailoring the Site to your preferences or interests, or
customizing promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow ERI to track use of the Site to
determine those areas that are useful or popular and those that are not, thereby enabling ERI to
improve and update the Site.
You may adjust your Web browsers in order to: (a) alert you regarding the use of cookies, or (b)
allow you to refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click
3
on the "Start" button and then select "Control Panel," "Internet Options," and the "Security" tab. If
you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users,
in the browser, select "File," "Preferences," and then "Advanced" to view the cookie options. If
you disable cookies, certain functions on the Site may not function properly.
Links to Other Sites. Please be aware that ERI provides links to third-party websites as a
service to guests, and ERI is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of
these third-party websites. Please note that these third-party websites' privacy policies may differ
from those of ERI. ERI encourages you to review and understand the privacy practices
associated with each third-party website before providing any third-party website with information.
Children. The Site is intended for the use of a general audience. The Site is neither designed nor
intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy
of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the
age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on the Site. We ask that parents supervise
their children while their children access the Internet.
Security. ERI uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to
protect it from loss, misuse, alternation, or destruction by any unauthorized party. For example,
ERI encrypts order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology in order to protect customers' information as it is sent over the Internet to ERI's server.
Access. If you would like to have Personal Information that you have submitted to ERI deleted
from ERI's system, please send your request to info.eri@erieri.com.
Opting-Out. If you do not want ERI to use your e-mail address for ERI's own marketing or
promotional purposes, you can remove yourself from ERI's e-mail list at any time by sending your
request to optout@erieri.com.
