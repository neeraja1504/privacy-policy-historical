Nectar
We are a partner in the Nectar loyalty card scheme.  That means that if you use your Nectar card when shopping with us you will be awarded points for most things that you buy.  The points can be spent with us or with any other Nectar partner.  If you use your Nectar card we can also see what products you have bought from us.  That allows us to personalise the offers we send to you and understand a bit more about the kind of shopper you are.

A 'cookie' is a very small text file that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive which allows us to help you get the best out of your visit to the website and improve your user experience. A 'cookie' can be thought of as an identification card which tells a website when you have returned.  To read our Cookie Policy please click here.
Links to other websites
Whilst we make every effort to provide you with links to other high quality, reputable websites, these websites are not under our day to day control.  Therefore we cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with their use of your information, the website content or the services offered to you by these websites.  We advise you to consult the privacy policy and terms and conditions on each website to see how each supplier may process your information.

Please remember it is your responsibility to set appropriate privacy settings on your social network accounts so you are comfortable with how your information is used and shared.

We treat all the information we hold securely and with the utmost care.
Your payment details are stored on our system in an encrypted format and can only be accessed when you place an order using your user name or email address and password.
Please be aware that we will only ever contact customers requesting confirmation of account details if your card is declined at the point of payment (this is not the same as the automatic pre authorisation which happens when you order your products online), or in certain circumstances when a refund to your card is required as Customer Care Team do not have access to your payment card details.
