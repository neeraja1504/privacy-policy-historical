Our Privacy Commitment to You
SaskTel places a high priority on the loyalty of our customers, and that loyalty is built on a foundation of good products, competitive prices, and, above all, excellent customer service.
Respecting your right to privacy is an important part of our service excellence commitment.  It is our goal to treat your personal information with the utmost respect. To us, this includes keeping you up-to-date on your rights as our customers and providing you with information on how we use your personal information. Our Privacy Statement outlines our commitment to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.
SaskTel may update this statement from time to time as reflected in the date at the end of this document, so please review it periodically. You are also encouraged to review the Legal Notices and User Agreement provided on this web site. They too, are provided for your information and protection.
Why We Collect Personal Information
Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable individual. This includes information about your product and service subscriptions and usage. Publicly available information, such as a public telephone book listing of your name, address and telephone number, is not considered personal information.
SaskTel collects information about you during the application process to confirm your identity and credit history, when communicating or transacting business with you, and when providing service to you. We may also collect information about you from third parties that have the right to disclose such information to us.
Telephone calls to or from our service representatives may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes.  We understand that some of this information is private, which is why we collect personal information only for the following purposes:
To establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you and to provide you with ongoing service. For example, we will collect information about you during the application process to conduct a credit history and / or when communicating or transacting business with you to confirm your identity; if you prefer to use pre-authorized payment for our services, we will collect bank account information in order to process payment.
To understand your needs and develop and recommend suitable products and services. For example, we maintain a record of products and services you receive from us, and we may ask you for additional information so that we can serve you better. For instance, if you wish to view your bill using our electronic payment service, we will ask for your e-mail address.
To manage your account and understand your needs and preferences * allowing us to  offer you *** better products and special offers that we think may be of interest to you.
To manage and develop our business and operations, including personnel and employment matters. For example, we analyze the usage of our networks to plan for future growth. We also collect information from individuals who apply for jobs with SaskTel.
To meet legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we may collect information in order to respond to a court order.
Sharing Your Personal Information
Personal information is not sold or rented to any parties outside of the SaskTel corporate family, without your consent or as permitted by SaskTel's Tariff.
We do share this information with the companies we select as our business partners, and who supply services to us. However, we require them by contract, to honour our privacy principles in the handling of personal information they obtain from us. The information provided to our business partners is used only for that purpose and any disclosure outside of SaskTel is made on a confidential basis . Should we sell a part of our business or merge or amalgamate part or all of our business with another entity, we may need to disclose customer information as part of the transaction. This is a normal business practice in any such transaction. Any such disclosure would be subject to appropriate privacy and security safeguards. In certain circumstances in which it is necessary to do so, or where permitted by law, we may disclose your personal information without your consent to the following parties:
the customer or an agent acting on the customer's behalf, such as Power of Attorney;
companies we select as our business partners;
a company that publishes a directory or directory-related services,
a collection agency or party used to determine creditworthiness or, for collecting unpaid balances;
a credit bureau reporting agency
courts, law enforcement agencies or otherwise legally empowered entities;
we may disclose personal information to meet legal or regulatory requirements, such as under a court order or, to a government institution if required or authorized by law;
to public authorities or their agents in cases of emergency e.g., a 911 call;
ombudsman

However, you will continue to be contacted as necessary to service your account, and you will receive marketing information included with your regular account mailings.

The information you provide to us on our web site is securely maintained and kept confidential. Information is retained in secure facilities, and protected from unauthorized access. We provide technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
For some services, SaskTel uses service providers located in another country to process and store information related to that service and as a result foreign governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of that country.
Children
The privacy of children is important to us. We encourage parents to review our Privacy Statement and our Legal Notices and User Agreement documents. We ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. Our services are intended for individuals who can form legally binding contracts. SaskTel does not use our web site to intentionally collect or use a child's personal data.
As an added protection for children, on any of our commercial web sites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, we will obtain the permission of a parent or legal guardian before collecting, using or disclosing any personally-identifiable information about a child, e.g., for participation in contests or promotions.
SaskTel is also a sponsor of Project Cleanfeed Canada, an initiative involving Canada's largest Internet Service Providers who have teamed up with Cybertip.ca to protect their customers from inadvertently visiting foreign web-sites that contain images of children being sexually abused and that are beyond the jurisdiction of Canadian legal authorities.
