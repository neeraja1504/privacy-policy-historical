Here are some important tips to use when dealing with prospective employers
Do not give your social security number unless you are confident that the other party is who they claim to be. For example, you could ask them for a call-back number to use for verification purposes.
Be careful when providing credit card or bank information, or engaging in any monetary transactions. Be sure to verify the legitimacy of the employer with whom you are interacting.
Do not provide any non-work-related personal information (e.g., Social Security Number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.
Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside your own country
Be wary of emails that offer an opportunity that involves acting as a go-between for money transfers. Disregard the email and DO NOT follow through with the employment offer being made.
