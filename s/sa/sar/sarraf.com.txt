Verify your identity for payment authorization;
Ship your order to you;
Contact you regarding your order status;
Personalize your shopping experience;
Send you helpful information from Sarraf Jewelry; and,
Generate anonymous statistics.
Your personal information will be shared with your credit card company and the party through whom your product is shipped. This shared personal information includes all the following:
your name;
your e-mail address;
your street address;
your telephone number
Your personal information will not be sold to mailing-list firms or distributed to any of Sarraf Jewelry's partners without your permission.

Further, Sarraf Jewelry provides you with access to third party partners to provide you certain services . If you decide to utilize these types of third party services , you will be directed to that third party's application. Sarraf Jewelry will provide that third party with your transaction information and then that third party will collect the additional information it needs in order to provide you with the requested service. Any information that you provide directly to that third party in connection with such services is covered by the privacy practices of such third party. Sarraf Jewelry is in no way responsible for the data collected or the privacy practices of any third party. You may want to consult the privacy policies of a third party prior to providing that third party with your address or other identifying information.
