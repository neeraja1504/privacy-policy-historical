Data Collection ****
Saach undertakes to collect Your Data by means that are:
fair;
legal; and
transparent.
If you visit Saach’s web-site , your web-browser automatically discloses, and Saach’s web-server may log, the following information: the date and time, the IP address from which you issued the request, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the URL of any page that referred you to the page, the URL you requested, and whether your request was successful. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.
Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web-form , may also be logged. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.
Any additional data that your web-browser automatically provides  may also be logged. This will be the case, for example, if your browser has previously been requested to store data on your computer in  ‘cookies’ and submits them each time you request a web-page within a particular domain (such as saach.tv). This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.
If you disclose personal data to Saach in conjunction with an identifier such as your name or your credit-card details , Saach will collect Your Data. Moreover, any data that becomes available to Saach through any of the means described in the preceding paragraphs may be able to be associated with that identifier, and hence become Your Data.
Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Saach undertakes to collect Your Data  from you  and not from other parties. This undertaking is qualified as follows:
where Saach reasonably considers that the protection of its financial interests requires that it gather YourData from other sources, or from additional sources. This applies in particular where Saach has a lending exposure to you, and seeks information about your creditworthiness;
where Saach reasonably considers that its capability to deliver quality services to you will be materially enhanced by gathering YourData from other sources. This applies in particular to consumer profile data.
Where Saach collects Your Data from sources other than you , it undertakes:
to do so only by legal means;
to do so only with your Consent; and
to declare to you what sources it uses, and under what circumstances.
Saach undertakes to declare the  purpose of collection  in a manner which is clear and meaningful, and to avoid vague, highly inclusive statements such as ‘to support our operations’.
Data Security ****
Saach undertakes to  store  Your Data in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity.
Saach undertakes to store Your Data only in  jurisdictions  where data protections are at least equivalent to those required under the OECD Guidelines.
Saach undertakes to  transmit  Your Data in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity.
Saach undertakes to implement appropriate  measures to ensure security of Your Data against inappropriate behaviour by Saach’s staff-members and contractors. These include:
training for staff in relation to privacy;
access control, to limit access to Your Data to those staff and contractors who have legitimate reasons to access it;
particularly in the case of sensitive data, audit trails of accesses, including the identities of staff and contractors accessing the data;
reminders to staff and contractors from time to time about the importance of data privacy, and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour;
declaration of appropriately strong sanctions that are to be applied in the event of inappropriate behaviour
clear communication of policies and sanctions; and
processes to audit, to investigate and to impose sanctions.
Data Use ****
Use refers to the application of Your Data by any part of Saach, or any staff-member or contractor of Saach in the course of their work.
Saach undertakes to use Your Data only for:
the purposes for which it was collected ;
such other purposes as are  subsequently agreed  between Saach and You;
such additional purposes as may be  required by law. In these circumstances, Saach will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that the use has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; and
such additional purposes as are  authorised by law  (in particular to protect Saach’s interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to Saach or have committed a breach of the criminal law).
Saach undertakes to use YourData only if it has  demonstrable relevance  to the particular use to which it is being put.
Saach undertakes to use YourData in such a manner as to take into account the possibility that it is not of  sufficient quality for the purpose , e.g. because it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or out-of-context.
Data Disclosure ****
Disclosure refers to making YourData available to any party other than Saach and You. The term disclosure may include many different conditions of data transfer, including selling, renting, trading, sharing and giving.
Saach undertakes to disclose Your Data only under the following circumstances:
in the course of business being conducted between You and Saach , where disclosure is necessary to a contractor, such as a transport company. Where Your Data is disclosed in this way, Saach undertakes to exercise control over Saach’s contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms;
in other circumstances that are directly implied by the purpose agreed between You and Saach  at the time of data collection or subsequently. Where Your Data is disclosed in this way, Saach undertakes to exercise control over Saach’s contractors to ensure that their actions are compliant with these Terms;
with your consent , or at your request;
where required by law , such as a provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or subpoena. In these circumstances, Saach will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that the disclosure has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law;
where permitted by law  (e.g. the reporting of suspected breach of the criminal law to a law enforcement agency; and in an emergency, where Saach believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure of YourData will materially assist in the protection of the life or health of some person), provided that Saach will apply due diligence to ensure that the exercise of the permission is justifiable.
In all cases, Saach undertakes to disclose only such of Your Data as is necessary in the particular circumstances.
Data Retention and Destruction ****
Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Saach undertakes:
to  retain  Your Data only as long as is consistent with its purpose; and
to  destroy  Your Data when its purpose has expired, and to do so in such a manner that Your Data is not subsequently capable of being recovered.
This undertaking is qualified as follows:
Your Data may be retained in Saach’s  logs, backups and audit trails  within short-term retention cycles that are devised to protect the company’s operations. In such cases, Your Data will be destroyed in accordance with those cycles;
Your Data may be retained beyond the expiry of its purpose if that is  required by law , such as a provision of a statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or sub poena, or a warning by a law enforcement agency that delivery of a court order is imminent. In these circumstances, Saach:
will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that Your Data is being retained, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; and
will only retain Your Data while that provision is current, and will then destroy Your Data;
Your Data may be retained beyond the expiry of its purpose if it is  authorised by law  (in particular to protect Saach’s interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to Saach or have committed a breach of the criminal law). In these circumstances, Saach will only retain Your Data while that situation is current, and will then destroy Your Data.
Access by You to Your Personal Data ****
Saach undertakes to provide you with  access  to Your Data, subject to only such conditions and processes as are reasonable in the circumstances. In particular, Saach undertakes to enable access:
conveniently;
without unreasonable delay; and
without cost.
Saach undertakes to establish and operate  identity authentication protections for access to Your Data  that are appropriate to its sensitivity, but practical. This may involve some inconvenience; for example, relatively straightforward procedures may be involved in order to provide you with access through a channel that you have previously registered with Saach (such as a particular email-address), but may impose more onerous procedures if you wish to use some other channel.
In the event that you dispute some aspect of Your Data, Saach undertakes to take reasonable steps in relation to the  amendment, supplementation or deletion  of Your Data.
You undertake:
not to seek access for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably frequently;
to accept that deletion of some data may not be consistent with the provision of particular services by Saach to you.
Information about Data-Handling Practices ****
Saach undertakes to make information available to you about the manner in which Saach handles your data:
in general terms, in a readily accessible manner; and
in more specific terms, on request.
Where Your Data is disclosed to a contractor, Saach undertakes to make information available to you on request about the manner in which Saach’s contractors handle your data.
Saach undertakes to ensure that the information provided is meaningful, and addresses your concerns.
You undertake:
not to seek such information for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably frequently; and
to accept that the disclosure of excessive detail may harm the security of Your Data and Saach’s business processes, and may harm Saach’s commercial interests.
Handling of Enquiries, General Concerns and Complaints ****
If you have enquiries, general concerns, or complaints about these Terms, or about Saach’s behaviour in relation to these Terms, you undertake:
to  communicate them in the first instance:
to Saach only;
in sufficient detail;
through a channel made available by Saach for that purpose;
Saach undertakes:
to provide one or more  channels for communications  to Saach, which are convenient to users;
to promptly provide  acknowledgement  of the receipt of communications, including the provision of a copy of the communication, the date and time it was registered, and Saach’s reference-code for the communication;
to promptly provide  a response  to the communication, in an appropriate and meaningful manner.
You further undertake to not pursue Saach through any  Regulator or the media :
until and unless Saach has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the initial communication; and
while Saach and you are conducting a meaningful dialogue about the matter.
Enforcement ****
Saach declares that its undertakings in these Terms are intended to create  legal obligations,  and that those obligations are intended to be  enforceable  under appropriate laws in appropriate jurisdictions. These include laws relating to data protection, privacy, fair trading, corporations and criminal laws.
You undertake to seek enforcement only in a  jurisdiction  that is relevant to the transactions that have taken place between You and Saach, in particular the jurisdiction in which you live or in which you performed the relevant acts, and the jurisdiction in which Saach is domiciled or performed the relevant acts.
Changes to These Privacy Undertakings ****
Saach undertakes:
not to unilaterally make any material change to these Terms in a manner that reduces the protections for Your Data;
to take all practicable steps to prevent any company that acquires this company or any of its relevant assets from materially changing the Terms applicable to Your Data in a manner that reduces the protections for Your Data;
where it is considering making changes to these Terms, or creating more specific Terms relating to specific services, to consult with appropriate representative and advocacy organisations;
where it makes changes to these Terms, to ensure that the differences between successive versions are readily accessible;
to maintain all prior versions of these Terms in such a manner that they are dated, and readily accessible.
