While some cookies are used to control basic functions of the site, some cookies store basic user information in certain ways.  Some cookies that are essential to your use of a SABINET site have already been set.

SABINET does not sell or share personal information about or the purchasing history of individual users, except as set forth above and in the following circumstances:
In certain situations, SABINET may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, European Union data subjects may seek an administrative or judicial remedy or to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the GDPR. Information on how to file such a complaint is available here  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
