Privacy Statement
Introduction
SABMiller Plc and its associated companies respect your privacy. This privacy statement outlines the type of personal information we may collect about you and how we may use it. We may update this statement from time to time, so please check it occasionally. By using our websites and/or providing personal information to us, you agree to the terms of this statement.
Collection and use of personal information
"Personal Information" includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, IP address, activities and product preferences. Generally, you may visit our websites and enjoy our products without providing us with any personal information. However, from time to time we may need to collect your personal information for a specific purpose, for example in order to allow you to take part in a competition or product promotion. You may also decide to allow us to contact you about our products. We will always endeavour to ensure that there is information readily available to you concerning the purposes for which your information is being processed. We will not use your information for any other purposes.
You may choose to use social media in order to contact us or find out about our products. You should be aware that the data which you contribute on social media is frequently subject to the privacy terms of the websites concerned, which are not under our control, and is therefore not covered by the terms of this privacy statement. We recommend that you read the terms of use of all social media you use, including in particular the information on privacy and how you can control the use of your personal information.
In common with many other businesses, we derive statistical data from the personal information we collect in order to analyse the effectiveness of our sales and marketing. We may share this statistical data with third parties, but not in a form which allows you to be identified or targeted.
From time to time we may need to collect information from you relating to your country of residence and your date of birth. This is because we do not market products containing alcohol to persons who are below the legal age for purchasing alcoholic beverages in the relevant country or (where there is no such age under local law) below the age of 18. If the information you provide shows that you are under the age threshold, then we will not store your information, although our websites may set cookies on the devices you use to access our websites in order to guard against attempts to bypass age control. For more information see our cookie statement. Where possible, we may use other information available to us from reputable sources in order to verify your date of birth.
Use of IP addresses
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your organizationâ€™s local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online.
We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the use of our sites. We do not ordinarily link a user's IP address to personally identifiable information of that user, which means each user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we may use IP addresses to identify users of our sites when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the site's terms of use, or to protect our services, sites or other users.
Visiting other websites
Our websites may provide links to websites operated by companies outside the SABMiller Group as a service to our users. This privacy statement does not apply to those sites. Please ensure you check the legal and privacy statements posted on each site you visit.
Disclosure
Personal information includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth and e-mail address. Generally, you may visit our website without providing us with any personal information. However, from time to time we may need to collect your personal information for a specific purpose, for example providing you with information that you have requested. We may also have statutory obligations to collect your personal information, such as the obligation to collect data on ethnic origin and disabilities under South African employment equity legislation (applied only to South African residents during the application process). If there are other purposes for which we will use your personal information, we will tell you at the time of collection. By providing this information, you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information for the purposes notified.
We may disclose your personal information to our associated companies and to third parties for the purposes made known to you. Apart from this, we will not sell, transfer or disclose your personal information to third parties unless we have your express consent, if we need to do so in order to fulfil any request you may have made, or where we are lawfully requested to make disclosure by a regulator or a law enforcement authority.
From time to time we may need to transfer your personal information from one jurisdiction to another. In such cases we will always endeavour to ensure that your information will be treated in accordance with the standard applicable in your stated country of residence.
Cookies
Our websites use cookies, for various purposes. In some cases these cookies are set by third parties. Further details about these cookies, how they interact with your personal information, and about what you can do to disable their use, are set out in our cookie statement.
Security and accuracy
The security of your personal information is important to us. We have put physical and technical procedures in place to maintain this. Only authorised staff has access to your information.
If you have submitted personal information to us and would like to see it, to delete it from our records, or to update it, then please use the opt-out or unsubscribe tools on any marketing email you may receive from us, or visit the contact us page.
