Saba may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this information with personal data we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and create more tailored advertising to provide products and services that may be of interest to you.
6. Sharing Your Personal Data
Personal data may be shared within the companies making up the Saba group, solely in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. All such companies are bound by appropriate data processing agreements and/or confidentiality undertakings, and will only use personal data in accordance with this Policy. Such companies are located within the European Economic Area, in countries that are regarded by the EU Commission as featuring an adequate level of data protection, or are subject to a valid transfer mechanism.
Personal data may also be shared, as required, with those who provide products and/or services to Saba and it customers - such as web site hosting, information technology consulting, web site management, foreign language support, complementary products and services requested by Users, data analysis, audit, legal, administrative, back-up, security, marketing and promotion. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of personal data necessary to provide the services on our behalf, and the third parties are (where legally required) bound by appropriate order data processing agreements (including a GDPR compliant level of data protection) and/or comprehensive confidentiality undertakings and therefore not permitted to use your personal data except for the limited purpose of completing the requested service or transaction.
Circumstances may arise where Saba may decide to sell, buy or otherwise reorganize some or all of its business. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers. Saba will seek appropriate protection for personal data in these types of transactions. Saba may also retain and disclose personal data in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal processes; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Saba, Website visitors, clients or the public; and (5) enforce our Website terms of service.
7. Preferences; Opt-Out (Withdrawal)
We may also ask Website Users to choose whether to allow Saba to share their personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. We will honor the choices made. If you subsequently decide that you no longer wish to receive promotional emails from Saba, or if you no longer wish to allow Saba to share your personal data on a going-forward basis for marketing purposes with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving such emails or from such sharing by simply following the opt-out procedure specified in such e-mail. In addition, if you have registered on our site, you may opt out of receiving any future marketing or similar messages by emailing your request to unsubscribe here: DataPrivacyRequests@saba.com
We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, and in conformance with applicable law. If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related emails from such third parties, please contact such third parties directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related emails.
Your personal data will be stored after the opt-out request for as long and as far as we are obliged to do so within the scope of the legal archiving obligations or we still need your personal data to carry out or process an existing contractual relationship or for purposes of proof.
We point out to you that the processing of your personal data, which we have carried out on the basis of your given consent until your withdrawal, is not affected by the withdrawal and remains legal.
Subject to applicable law, you may be entitled to withdraw your consent (opt-out) to the processing of your personal data for the future at any time. To do so, please contact the office mentioned in Section 12 below.
8. External Links
The Website may include links to other web sites not controlled by Saba. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of personal data and/or information by such third parties. Once you leave our Website, use of any personal data you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the site you are visiting.
9. Security and Confidentiality
Saba takes appropriate and commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, accidental loss or damage and unauthorized destruction. Unfortunately, however, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure. Saba staff and third parties who handle personal data are required to treat it confidentially and are not permitted to use or share it except as provided in this Policy.
For the aforesaid purpose, your personal data is encrypted during transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS). This means that the communication between your computer and the servers of the Website takes place using a recognized encryption method, which is considered secure in the current version (currently TLS 1.2). If your browser supports TLS, this function protects the transmission of personal data. In this case, most browsers display a short dialog box or a graphic icon to indicate whether the security protocol is supported. You can find further information in the help function of your browser.
10. Data Retention
We will not keep personal data longer than as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes outlined herein, or as required by law or regulation. We seek to avoid the retention of unnecessary or duplicative information. Thus, we delete personal data of Website users routinely, unless we are legally obliged to keep such data for a longer period or we still need your personal data to carry out or process an existing contractual relationship or for purposes of proof. In such a case we delete the relevant data after the legal retention period has expired or as soon as we no longer need the data for the execution or processing of an existing contractual relationship or for purposes of proof.
Saba's headquarters office is located at 4120 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 200, Dublin, CA 94568.
11. Access, Deletion, Correction, Restriction of Processing, Objection and Data Portability
Our goal is to ensure your personal data is accurate and complete. You can help us accomplish this by letting us know when it changes. Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to obtain information from us about your personal data processed by us, as well as the right to correct, delete, restrict processing, object to processing and to data portability. If you wish to exercise one or more of the above rights, please contact the office indicated in Section 12 below. Should there be a requirement for Saba to retain your personal data, Saba will delete it when the requirement to retain it has ceased.
