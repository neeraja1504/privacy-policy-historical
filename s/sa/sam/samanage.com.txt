Privacy Policy | Samanage
Effective date: March 5, 2018
Purpose
This privacy policy applies to www.samanage.com owned and operated by Samanage.
Samanage respects the privacy of anyone who uses a Samanage website (www.samanage.com) or the Samanage Service. Samanage publishes this Privacy Policy to communicate how we gather and use information about you and how we protect it. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Information Related to Data Collected for our Customers
Samanage collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a user of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
Samanage acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information.
Samanage has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct the query to the Samanage customer (the data controller). If the customer requests Samanage to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.
We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customer. Samanage will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Information Collected
We require customers who use the Samanage service (Service) to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and email address. At the time you express interest in receiving additional information or evaluating our service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional personal and company information, such as your role. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version.
Samanage uses the information collected to provision and deliver the Service for organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our Service, and to send information regarding our company and our partners, such as marketing promotions, newsletters, and invitations to participate in events. Other than in connection with provision of the Service, customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@samanage.com.
Except as stated at the time we request information, or as contemplated in this policy or the Samanage Master Subscription Agreement or required by law, we do not disclose any personally identifiable information (including, without limitation, email addresses) that is provided by customers to third parties. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
Samanage may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share customer information with them to provide the Services. Examples include billing, fulfilling orders, provisioning, sending emails, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and EU-Swiss Privacy Shield, Samanage is potentially liable.
We may utilize a tool that enables us to monitor visitors inputs (which includes mouse and keyboard actions), but we will only save information regarding the time and date of such inputs and the related input field. In addition, as part of the registration process, we will collect and store information filled out by you in the registration form, which may be later retrieved in case that the registration process was interrupted and needs to be reinitiated. We may also use this information to contact you for technical assistance reasons and/or sales purposes.
Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to www.samanage.com.
Protection of Company and Others
Samanage may release information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Samanage, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We may choose to buy or sell assets during the normal course of business. Customer information can be one of the assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Samanage, or substantially all of its relevant assets, were acquired by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise, customer information would be one of the assets that would be transferred. You will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Customer Data
Customers using the Service will be storing data and information (Customer Data), and will connect the Service to customers’ computers using the Samanage Agent (Agent) for the purpose of collecting configuration and inventory data and storing data together with the Customer Data. Samanage will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any Customer Data except as provided in this policy or in the Samanage Master Subscription Agreement or as may be required by law, and except for the purposes of deploying, supporting or enhancing the Service. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.
Samanage may also be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Samanage is subject to the investigative and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Customers who are Covered Entities or Business Associates under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (“HIPAA”) must agree to comply with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, including without limitation the Minimum Necessary Rule at 45 CFR 164.502(b). While Samanage has put safeguards in place consistent with those required by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, because of the nature of Samanage service, Samanage does not expect to receive any Protected Health Information (PHI) from Covered Entities or Business Associates. Because Samanage does not review Customer Data, as set forth above, Customer understands and accepts that Samanage will not be able to provide the identities of individuals whose PHI is in Samanage’s system for any HIPAA reporting obligations.
Samanage may provide the ability for website visitor to request additional information or contact Samanage. We collect certain information from visitors such as their name, phone number and email and the purpose of their request or interest. This information is captured in our systems to better serve our customers and visitor needs. We also capture log information from our servers to help diagnose technical problems, and to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our website visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
User Access and Choice
Upon request Samanage will provide customer with information about whether we hold any customer personal information. If customer personally identifiable information changes, or if the customer no longer desires our service, customer may update, change, amend and delete/remove registration information by going to the user or company profile record under the setup/administration section. To discontinue the Service customers should simply let a trial period expire. For paid subscription and if you need assistance in correcting, updating or deleting your information, please send your request to support@samanage.com or contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. Samanage will respond to your correction or update request within at most 30 days from the date of your request.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information to improve our services.
