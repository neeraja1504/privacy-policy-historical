We do not sell member information.

Information we collect
We collect information in order to better serve our members. Sometimes the information we collect includes simple things like what browser you are using. Sometimes the information we collect can also include sensitive or private information, such as medical bills and other health information. We will try and explain what we collect and why, and also what we use the information for.
We collect information in two ways:
Information you give us.  This includes uploading images of bills, entering in personal information on an application or simply requesting more info. This type of information is always given to us voluntarily, and many times the purpose is to provide a service to you.
Information such as your name, address, date of birth, email etc. may be collected and used to send you additional information about Samaritan or as part of your membership information. It is the goal of Samaritan to only collect data necessary to conduct the needs of the ministry and any agreed upon service in a way that is simple and secure.
When a Need is published to the membership, the name, address, prayer request and short description of the Need are included in a share slip sent to a certain number of members based on need size. This allows the membership to share directly with one another.
Information we get from your use of our services.  We collect information about what you use on our site and how you use it. This information helps us to provide a higher level of service and gives us insight on how best to improve. The information we collect includes:
