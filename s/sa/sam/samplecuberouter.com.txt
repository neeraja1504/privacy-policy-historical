What is personal data?
"Personal data" is any information relating to an identifiable or identified person (you as a user). An identifiable person is someone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, for example by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
The processing of special categories of data, defined as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and of data concerning health or sex life, is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions.
Personal data which we handle
The processing of the personal data, the specific purposes for the processing, the legal basis for the processing are described below, and for how long we store your personal data is described below.
Email address
We collect and process your email address to validate that the user entering our system is a real person. We do this as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Address
We collect and process your address (only postal code, state, region and country) as most surveys are geo-targeted to respondents from specific locations. We do this as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Date of Birth
As most surveys are targeting respondents based on age, we collect and process your date of birth/age , as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Professional Details
Many surveys are targeted to specific professional profiles. Therefore, we collect and process your professional details as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Profiling Details
For statistical reasons, many surveys require profiling details (including gender, highest completed level of education, occupation, marital status and annual/monthly income). We therefore collect and process this personal data as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Event registration details
Some survey creators collect event registration details , and this is therefore collected and processed by us, as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
Special categories of personal data
On rare occasions, survey creators ask for any of the here specified special categories of personal data. This means religious/philosophical belief, race and ethnicity, political opinion, sex life, and sexual orientation. Therefore, we collect and process such information, as it is necessary for our performance of a contract where you as a user are a party.
All of the personal data which we collect/process is stored by us for as long as you as a user are active and is automatically deleted when you have been inactive for six (6) months. All profiling details described above are always deleted after six (6) months and must be re-entered by you.
Opinion Capital inc. may share your personal information and/or social-demographic information, including, without limitation, a unique identification number (" UID "), postal code, region, province, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, non-personally identifiable information on household members, consumer product and service usage and ownership (e.g., computers, cars, mobile devices, video games, etc.), home ownership, pet ownership, employment information (e.g., title, role, travel, industry, etc.), and social grade, with third party sample/market research companies (individually each a " Third Party MR Company " and collectively the " Third Party MR Companies ") for the following purposes:
Identifying client survey opportunities that you may be eligible for through the Third Party MR Companies; and
Disclosing such data elements to clients of the Third Party MR Companies for audience measurement services; and
Appending such data elements to completed client surveys and delivering the appended survey data to clients of the Third Party MR Company(ies) for analytical or research purposes; and
Other uses as set forth in their privacy policy.
If you are eligible for a client survey opportunity offered through a Third Party MR Company, the Third Party MR Company will provide your unique identification number and a survey link to us and we will invite you to participate in the client survey through a router link, a survey wall or by email via a SurveyAlert you subscribed to. We will not share your name, email address, or phone number with the Third Party MR Companies. In connection with the sharing of your information with a Third Party MR Company, your information may be transferred and stored outside of your country of residence, including, without limitation, in the United States, and by agreeing to this privacy policy you are agreeing to the processing and exportation of your personal information as set forth in this Section.
If you have any questions about this data sharing please contact privacy@opinioncapital.com or you can opt-out by emailing us the same way. If you opt-out, it is the responsibility of us to inform the Third Party MR Companies. Please note that Opinion Capital inc. is solely liable and responsible for managing all opt-out requests. Your participation in such survey opportunities does not entitle you to any benefits offered by, or membership with, the Third Party MR Companies.
