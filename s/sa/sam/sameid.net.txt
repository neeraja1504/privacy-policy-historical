Privacy Policy
[%STATUS%]
Principles
We have a few fundamental principles about privacy and the information we collect:
We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display through SameID.net.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.
Introduction
SameID.net operates web-based services. It is SameID.net's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. This privacy policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of the personal information we collect and how you can access and update this information.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, contact admin@SameID.net.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, SameID.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SameID.net's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SameID.net’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SameID.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
SameID.net also uses third party tracking-utility partners who use log files to collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SameID.net does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to SameID.net's websites choose to interact with SameID.net in ways that require SameID.net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SameID.net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up as a user at SameID.net to provide an email address. We also provide them the opportunity to provide additional information such as name and phone number. Those who engage in transactions with SameID.net – by purchasing a account plan at SameID.net, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, SameID.net collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SameID.net. SameID.net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Opt-Out Policy
SameID.net offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering services at SameID.net, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties as outlined in this privacy policy, simply send us a request at admin@SameID.net

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
