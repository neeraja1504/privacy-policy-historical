Collected information
We've structured the SaudiGulf Airline websites so that, in general, you can visit SaudiGulf Airline on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. We make this notice readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every SaudiGulf Airline web page.
There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. Generally, you will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the SaudiGulf Airline websites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services.
