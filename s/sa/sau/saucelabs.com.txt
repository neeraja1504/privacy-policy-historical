You may also provide information specific to your interaction with our Services, such as payment information to make a purchase. In such instances, you will know what data is collected, because you will actively submit it.

Unless you also actively submit personal information to us, any information that is passively submitted typically does not allow us to identify you personally.

In these circumstances, we may collect and process your contact information (e.g., name, email address, phone number and business address), information about your business and its interactions with us, and any other personal information you actively provide to us.

To Whom Do We Disclose Your Personal Information?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share your personal information only as described below and in accordance with applicable law.
Third-Party Service Providers : We employ our Affiliated and other unaffiliated companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as to send email, remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links (including paid listings and links), process credit card payments, and provide customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Affiliates : We share your personal information with our Affiliates to help fulfil sales, respond appropriately to requests and to improve our and their services and business practices. A list of our operating Affiliates and their addresses is available here.
Business Transfers : As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, business units or our entire business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise) and applicable laws.
Protection of Sauce Labs and Others : We disclose account and other personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sauce Labs, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

What Security Measures Have We Implemented?
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input, to protect information you submit via our Services.
We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
