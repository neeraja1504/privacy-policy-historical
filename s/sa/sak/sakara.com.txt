NUTRITION AND ALLERGY DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY WAIVER
We want you to be your healthiest, but we’re not doctors.  You should always consult your doctor before making any changes to your health regime--including starting on a Sakara meal program or using Sakara products.
By using Sakara products or services, you acknowledge that you are doing so at your own risk, and have consulted with your doctor or other health professional about your diet change.
We do not claim our meal program, products, or services will alleviate, heal or cure any health condition or symptom. The content of this website and any product or service Sakara offers are not meant to diagnose, treat, prevent or cure any medical condition, and should not be used as a substitute for consulting a doctor or other health professional. Any information that you find on this website, on websites we link to, receive from our employees, suppliers, or agents by phone, email or other communication channel, or obtain through contacts you make through Sakara should be verified with your doctor. Consult your doctor with any specific health questions or problems you may have. If you think you have a medical emergency or any condition requiring immediate attention, call your doctor or 911 immediately. The statements made by Sakara Life on this website and our programs and products have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Our program is not intended for people with severe allergies. Our kitchen facilities process and regularly use nuts. We modify meals upon request, but do not provide a product for people with medically-necessitated diets or severe allergies.
PRICING AND AVAILABILITY
All prices are shown in U.S dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice; provided, however, that if we change the amounts or other charges associated with our various subscription plans, we will provide you with advance notice of such changes. We will not, however, be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes. The shipment of your subscription meals or products to you after our delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your subscription(s) in accordance with the cancellation policies set forth in the “Cancellation of Subscription” section of these terms.
All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to substitute Products (including, but not limited to, specific ingredients in a meal or entire meals) without prior notice. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and due to the perishable nature of certain ingredients and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at info@sakaralife.com. Note that gifts with purchase during special programs are available on a first-come, first-serve basis and subject to availability.
Our meal programs are scheduled according to availability. We cannot guarantee that a certain date is available to start the meal program as spots fill up quickly. The cut-off time for the program sign-up is 11:59PM EST two days before you want the program to start (for example: for Monday start, you must order the program no later than 11:59PM EST on preceding Thursday).
Most Sakara products and services displayed at the Site are available only via online request in the United States while supplies last. Sakara does not ship internationally. In the case of international deliveries via third- party services, Sakara shall not be responsible or be held liable for delivery or use of the products once Sakara has delivered to specified U.S. destination.
PAYMENTS, BILLING AND PROMOTIONS
Payment is due upon purchasing your Sakara Life product or program. By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any payment method problems before we proceed with your Order. If you want to change or update your payment method information, you can do so at any time by logging into your account. If a payment is not successfully settled and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the payment method, as it may be updated. You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, preferences you select, changes you make to your Subscription, or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third party-payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.
By signing up for a meal program subscription, you acknowledge and authorize Sakara to collect, save, and charge your provided payment method for future transactions on your account regarding your subscription. For more details on recurring billing, please see the section titled “CONTINUOUS SUBSCRIPTIONS.”
PROMOTIONS, REFERRALS, AND DISCOUNTS
If you are using a promotion or a discount code, please enter it at checkout to receive an immediate discount. Only one promotion or discount code may be used per order. Promotion or discount codes may be used on already discounted programs, however we reserve the right to cease this practice at any time without notice. If you are using a discount code on a subscription program, once the first week of the subscription ends, we (or our third-party payment processor) will begin billing your designated payment method on a recurring basis for the non-discounted price of your program (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) for as long as your subscription continues, unless you cancel your subscription prior to the cutoff date for any weeks of your program beyond the discounted week. Instructions for cancelling your subscription are described in the “Cancellation of Subscription” section below. Please note that you will not receive a notice from us that the discounted week has ended, or that the full-priced portion of your subscription has begun. Holiday and other special promotions may, at the option of Sakara, carry specific terms and conditions, and we reserve the right to create, amend, and enforce said terms, conditions, and restrictions.
Through our referral program, (Share the Glow program), we offer you the opportunity to receive a $50 discount off of an organic meal delivery program for each new client that you refer to us who completes an order of an organic meal delivery program. We also offer a $50 discount to each new client that you are referring, valid only on their first order of our organic meal delivery program. Please note that in order for you and the new client to be eligible to receive the discount, they must be a new client (have not ordered any meals or products from Sakara Life before), they must purchase an organic meal delivery program, and they must order using the appropriate discount code and through your shared URL links. Once they place their eligible order, you will receive an email with a $50 discount credit, valid on our organic meal delivery program.

Where should we leave your Sakara cooler bag or box? (the more descriptive the better)
Is yours a residence or commercial building?
Should we leave at your doorstep, hang on your doorknob, or leave with your doorman?
Would you like the delivery team to call you on arrival?
Delivery Schedule
We will notify you via email of our should there be a change in delivery schedule due to holidays.
DELIVERY DISCLAIMER
Sakara is not responsible for failed deliveries due to incorrect or incomplete addresses.
All Sakara meals are to be kept refrigerated until consumed and freshness cannot be not guaranteed past the 4th day upon receipt. It is up to the client to maintain freshness once received. Our meals are packaged with insulated liners and ice packs and will typically remain cold and fresh for several hours, but depending on the season and temperature in your geographic area at the time of delivery, advance planning by you should be made for immediate and proper storage of your meals prior to consumption. It’s important to put your Sakara meals and perishable items in the refrigerator when you receive them. By purchasing the Sakara organic meal delivery program, you agree to properly and promptly refrigerate all meals until you plan to eat them.  Since all of our food is fresh (and preservative-free, chemical-free, etc.), it will go bad if not properly taken care of.
In certain areas, you may be able to provide additional delivery instructions when setting up your account or placing your order, such as requesting that your delivery be left with a doorman or neighbor. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself. We will do our best to deliver your meals to you in accordance with your specifications. However, if you are not home to receive the delivery, our team will leave your bag or box according to your delivery instructions or in the safest available spot. Sakara is not responsible for replacing programs once delivered, in the event that you are not home and the delivery is taken.
Once the delivery has been made based on your specifications, we are no longer responsible for any damage or delay on part of other persons, circumstances, or for the security of its contents. You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of the Products you receive. If you think the contents are not suitable for consumption or have been tampered with, please let us know as soon as possible so we can find a more suitable arrangement for the next delivery.
Sakara is not responsible for damage or loss of personal property during deliveries if evidence of misconduct cannot be provided.
PROGRAM AND DELIVERY MODIFICATIONS
If you are traveling, you can reschedule your deliveries by signing into your account, or email us at info@sakaralife.com for help. Because all meal programs are made to order, we require that you let us know by Wesnesday at midnight of any changes to be made for programs beginning the following week, including but not limited to paused delivery, address changes, meal modifications, and delivery window changes.
WEATHER & TRAFFIC ALLOWANCES
Our delivery partners do their best to get your food to you on time so you may enjoy it at its freshest. Still, they run into delays due to weather, traffic and other factors that are outside of their control. We  cannot   guarantee delivery  within your selected time slot.
In instances of inclement weather, we hold the right to cancel our deliveries in order to avoid putting our delivery teams at risk. In such a case, we will notify you as early as possible and your program will be automatically extended by the number of days cancelled. If this does not suit your schedule, please let us know and we will do our best to find a better arrangement.
As both traffic and weather are outside of Sakara’s normal control, cash refunds cannot be issued for affected orders.
RETURNS, REPLACEMENTS, REFUNDS, AND CREDITS
Since our products are handcrafted and made-to-order with fresh ingredients, we cannot accept returns. All sales are final. If a product arrives damaged or you have concerns, please contact our Wellness Team (info@sakaralife.com). We do our best to ensure a flawless experience, and depending on the circumstances, we may, in our sole discretion, replace the meal or products, provide you with a full or partial refund for the purchase price of that meal or products, or provide you with a credit for that meal or product that will be automatically applied to future deliveries under your meal subscription. If issued, a refund may take 3-5 business days to show up, depending on which bank you use. If you are provided with a credit for a future program, we may implement the credit in a variety of ways at our discretion, including extending the program for you ourselves, providing you with a discount code to use on a future order, or applying a credit to your account, which will be automatically deducted from your next payment. If you have any questions regarding the replacement, refund, and credit logistics, please reach out to us at info@sakaralife.com for help.
Refunds will not be issued for delays that are the result of factors outside Sakara’s control, including but not limited to weather, traffic, and unexpected events as they relate to our delivery partners. If for any reason have we have to cancel your delivery, you will be notified by email, and the number of meals canceled will be credited to your account which will be applied towards your next subscription payment. If this does not suit your schedule, please let us know and we will do our best to find a better arrangement.
