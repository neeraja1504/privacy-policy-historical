Users, at any time, may request a deletion of their personal data. If such request is made, the account will be disactivated and will remain in backups and life-cycle we maintain to ensures we do not store data inside backups more than 90 days. Users may email dataprotectionofficer@sdc.com to request data deletion, cancel their User account or fill out the GDPR User Rights form on the site. If Users fail to make payment for any premium plans, SDC.com will remove all paid features and return Users to the Free / Trial Plan.

Data Retention
Information storage and security
SDC.com uses data hosting service providers in the United States to host collected information, and we use technical measures to secure all data. Despite the thorough security measures and safeguards that SDC.com implements to protect data, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, SDC.com cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. SDC.com has policies in place in case of such situation and will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe. Please contact dataprotectionofficer@sdc.com for more information.
How long we keep information
How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will make every effort to delete your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
User Account information: We retain User information until User delete their account(s), which then we will continue retaining the data for up to 90 days after account deletion. In particular: Email, Admin Notes, IPs, Access History, Payment History and Nickname. SDC.com maintains this practice due to the following reason:
In the event that User’s account has been compromised and purposely deleted. SDC.com will help maintain and restore data once the situation is rectified.
An account was mistakenly deleted by Users. In such an event, SDC.com will be able to restore data for Users.
Various data storage systems and backups have different lifecycle policies which are held for a maximum of 90 days. For example, our database backups are encrypted, incremental and full re-cycle in 30 days. It is impossible to erase User data inside encrypted incremental backups in real-time.
SDC.com may also retain some of the User data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies any specific Users, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about any Users. The information you share on the Services: If User’s account is deactivated or disabled, some of the User information and the content that Users have provided will remain in order to allow other members or other Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to forums. SDC.com will hold User data up to 90 days after account cancellation in case Users will renew again within that time frame.
Marketing and Promotional information: If Users have elected and provided consent to receive marketing and promotional emails from SDC.com, we retain information about Users’ marketing preferences unless asked specifically to delete such information. SDC.com retains information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable and specific period of time from the date such information was created.

Data Subject Access Request Procedure
Data Subject Access Request (“DSAR”)
A Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) is any request made by an individual or an individual’s legal representative for information held by the Company about that individual. The Data Subject Access Request provides the right for data subjects to see or view their own personal data as well as to request copies of the data.
A Data Subject Access Request must be made in writing. In general, verbal requests for information held about an individual are not valid DSARs. In the event a formal Data Subject Access Request is made verbally to a staff member of the Company, further guidance should be sought from Data Protection Officer, who will consider and approve all Data Subject Access Request applications.
A Data Subject Access Request can only be made via any of the following methods: email, post, or corporate website. DSARs made online must be treated like any other Data Subject Access Requests when they are received, though the Company will not provide personal information via social media channels.
Requirements for a valid DSAR
In order to be able to respond to the Data Subject Access Requests in a timely manner, the data subject should:
â€¢ Submit his/her request using a Data Subject Access Request Form.
â€¢ Provide SDC.com with sufficient information to validate his/her identity (to ensure that the person requesting the information is the data subject or his/her authorized person).
Subject to the exemptions referred to in this document, SDC.com will provide information to data subjects whose requests are in writing (or by some other method explicitly permitted by the local law), and are received from an individual whose identity can be validated by SDC.com. Requests are more likely to be successful where they are specific and targeted at particular information.
Factors that can assist in narrowing the scope of a search include identifying the likely holder of the information (e.g. by making reference to a specific department), the time period in which the information was generated or processed (the narrower the time frame, the more likely a request is to succeed) and being specific about the nature of the data sought (e.g. a copy of a particular form or email records from within a particular department).
Exemptions
An individual does not have the right to access information recorded about someone else, unless they are an authorized representative, or have parental responsibility.
SDC.com is not required to respond to requests for information unless it is provided with sufficient details to enable the location of the information to be identified, and to satisfy itself as to the identity of the data subject making the request.
In principle, SDC.com will not normally disclose the following types of information in response to a Data Subject Access Request: â€¢ Information about other people – A Data Subject Access Request may cover information which relates to an individual or individuals other than the data subject. Access to such data will not be granted, unless the individuals involved have previously given consent to the disclosure of their data in one of the scenarios detailed above, such as communications from other users.
â€¢ Repeat requests – Where a similar or identical request in relation to the same data subject has previously been complied with within a reasonable time period, and where there is no significant change in personal data held in relation to that data subject, any further request made within a three month period of the original request will be considered a repeat request, and SDC.com will not normally provide a further copy of the same data
â€¢ Publicly available information – The Company is not required to provide copies of documents which are already in the public domain, such as stories, forum contributions, and other User generated content.
â€¢ Opinions given in confidence or protected by copyright law – SDC.com does not have to disclose personal data held in relation to a data subject that is in the form of an opinion given in confidence or protected by copyright law.
â€¢ Privileged documents – Any privileged information held by SDC.com need not be disclosed in response to a DSAR. In general, privileged information includes any document which is confidential (e.g. a direct communication between a client and his/her lawyer) and is created for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice.
Data Subject Access Request Refusals
There are situations where individuals do not have a right to see information relating to them. For instance: â€¢ If the information is kept only for the purpose of statistics or research, and where the results of the statistical work or research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the individuals involved.
â€¢ Requests made for other, non-data protection purposes can be rejected.
If the responsible person refuses a Data Subject Access Request on behalf SDC.com, the reasons for the rejection must be clearly set out in writing. Any individual dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her Data Subject Access Request is entitled to make a request to the Data Protection Officer to review the outcome.
No Guarantees for Factors Beyond SDC’s Control
While this Privacy Statement expresses SDC’s standards for maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond SDC’s control (e.g., “script kiddies, crackers and other malcontents, hurricanes, tornados, acts of God, loss of power, diseases, loss of mind, body and soul”) that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, SDC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.
