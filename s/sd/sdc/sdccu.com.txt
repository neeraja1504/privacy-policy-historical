We do not disclose your nonpublic personal information to any nonaffiliated third party or to any affiliate except as permitted by law. For example, we may share your nonpublic personal information as necessary to effect a transaction you request, or in connection with servicing or processing your account. We may also share your nonpublic personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties in order for such other parties to perform business or professional services, such as printing, mailing services, data processing or analysis, or customer surveys, on our behalf or to otherwise assist us in processing transactions on your behalf, maintaining or servicing your account, fulfilling your service request or protecting the security of your financial records.

Security Procedures
The security of nonpublic personal information is very important to us and we take a number of steps to protect it. We limit access to personal and account information only to those San Diego County Credit Union employees who need to know that information in providing products and services to you. We maintain procedural, electronic, and physical safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also require affiliates with whom we do business to maintain strong confidentiality practices.
We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from you. Cryptography scrambles information exchanged between your browser and our online banking server. Encryption happens as follows: when you enter and submit your account number and password for online banking, your browser establishes a secure session with our server. The secure session is established using a secure and industry standard protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encryption. This protocol requires the exchange of what are called public and private keys. Keys are random numbers chosen for that session known only between your browser and our server. After the keys are exchanged, your browser will use the numbers to scramble (encrypt) the messages sent between your browser and our server. Both sides require the keys because they need to descramble (decrypt) the messages when they are received. The SSL protocol is designed to not only ensure privacy but also to ensure that no other browser can "impersonate" your browser, nor alter any information sent. You can tell whether your browser is in secure mode by looking for the secured lock symbol at the bottom of your browser window. The numbers used as encryption keys are analogous to combination locks. The strength of encryption is based on the number of possible combinations that a lock can have. As the number of possible combinations grows, it becomes less likely that anyone would be able to guess the combination in order to decrypt the message.
Most of today's browsers offer 128-bit encryption which results in a large number of possible combinations. Our servers are compatible with browsers that provide 40-bit encryption, although we recommend the use of 128-bit capable browsers. Click here to determine the level of encryption that your browser supports.
We want you to use our Site with confidence, knowing that the information you submit to us is secure. To verify that a page on our Site is secure, position the arrow of your mouse over a portion of the page where there is not a graphic image. Right click on your mouse and select the option that provides properties or information about the page being viewed (Note: The option title will vary by browser).The properties or page information section will indicate the encryption strength being used to view the secure page.
All online applications, forms and email on our Site are secure and feature a small graphic of a lock on the page. The encryption strength varies from 40 bit to 128 bit depending on the browser you are using. You will also see a VeriSign graphic on pages in our Site with applications, forms and email links. VeriSign provides us with Internet trust services for secure electronic communications over IP networks. You may click on the graphic to verify that our secured site certificate is valid. VeriSign provides additional information about their services and security.
Emails that you may send to us outside of our the sign-on page for online banking on our Site, may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured Email. We provide a number of additional security features in online banking. Online banking will "timeout" after 15 minutes of inactivity. This prevents curious persons from continuing your home banking session in case you have left your PC unattended without logging out. Requests you make through the Internet are handled by our home banking server, which retrieves the information you request from our mainframe via proxy-based firewall servers. These servers act as the intermediary between you and our mainframe computers. When you submit your password, it is compared with the password we have stored in our secure data center. We allow you to enter your password incorrectly four times. If you enter your password incorrectly more than four times, your online banking account will be locked until you call us to reinitialize the account. We monitor and record "bad login" attempts to detect any suspicious activity, such as someone trying to guess your password. You play a crucial role in preventing others from logging on to your account.
Never use passwords that are easy to guess. Examples of bad passwords are: birth dates, first names, pet names, addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers. Never reveal your password to another person or entity. You should periodically change your password in the Account Management section of Internet Branch.
Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of member information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information only to authorized persons, processes and transactions.
Correcting Inaccuracies
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as due to a change in your address), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update your personal data provided to us. These actions can usually be done in the Account Management section of Internet Branch. Alternatively, you can write to us at, San Diego County Credit Union, 6545 Sequence Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Or you may call us at (877) 732-2848.
