In circumstances where a you consent to personal information being sent outside Australia, the receiving entity will be subject to applicable data protection and privacy laws operating in that jurisdiction. You may have rights to enforce the receiving entities compliance with applicable laws but you may not have recourse against the receiving entity under Australian Privacy Legislation and regulations in relation to how the receiving entity treats your personal information.
The School may also store personal information in the ‘cloud’ which may mean that it routes across international networks and/or resides on servers outside of Australia where it may be stored for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Sensitive Information
In referring to ‘sensitive information’ the School means information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences, criminal record or health information and biometric information about an individual.
Sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided, or a directly related secondary purpose, unless you agree otherwise, or when the use or disclosure of the sensitive information is allowed by law.
Management and Security of Personal Information
The School’s staff are required to respect the confidentiality of students’, parents’ and guardians’ personal information and the privacy of individuals. The School has in place steps to protect the personal information the School holds from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, by use of various methods including locked storage of paper records, physical security of servers, use of firewalls and restricted access rights to computerised records via logins and passwords.
Updating Information
The School endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up to date, relevant and not misleading. A person may seek to update their personal information held by the School at any time.
The Australian Privacy Principles require the School not to store personal information longer than necessary. The School takes reasonable steps to de-identify or destroy personal information no longer required by it for the permitted purpose.
Access and Correction to Personal Information
Under the Commonwealth Privacy Act (and Health Records Act), an individual has the right to request access to any personal information which the School holds about them and to advise the School of any perceived inaccuracy. There are some circumstances where access may be denied. Such circumstances would include where release of the information would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others, or where the release may result in a breach of the School’s duty of care to the student. Students will generally have access to their personal information through their parents, although older students may seek access themselves.
Requests to access any information the School holds about you or your child should be forwarded in writing to the Privacy Officer (privacyofficer@strathcona.vic.edu.au). The School may require you to verify your identity and specify what information you wish to view. The School may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying your application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. If the information sought is extensive, the School will advise the likely cost in advance.
Note that personal employment records are exempted from the Act, and hence from access.
Breach of the Australian Privacy Principles
If a person believes the School has breached its obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles, that person should forward a complaint in writing to the Privacy Officer (privacyofficer@strathcona.vic.edu.au). The complaint should include sufficient details of the alleged breach. The School will respond to that person within a reasonable time after receipt of the complaint. In responding to that person, the School will determine whether a breach has occurred and, if so, the appropriate response in light of the circumstances.
If the person does not believe the complaint was adequately dealt with by the School, that person may make a further complaint to the Privacy Commissioner and seek advice regarding any such complaint from the Privacy Hotline 1300 363 992. Once referred to the Privacy Commissioner the complaint will be dealt with by way of conciliation. If a resolution cannot be reached the Privacy Commissioner may make a determination which is binding on the parties and enforceable at law.
A person wishing to make a complaint should first attempt to resolve any complaint with the School directly before referring the complaint to the Privacy Commissioner.
Consent
Generally, the School will refer any requests for consent and notices in relation to the personal information of a student to the student’s parents. The School will treat consent given by parents as consent given on behalf of the student and notice to parents will act as notice given to the student.
