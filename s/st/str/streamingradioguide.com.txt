ISP Directory - Privacy Statement
FindAnISP.com has created this privacy statement to fully inform you of the ways in which we do or do not gather and communicate your private information.
Page Tracking
Like all web sites, we have the ability to see IP addresses of users who visit our site, and the pages that those IP addresses visited, and at what times. In addition to the normal logging of web accesses provided by the Apache web server, we log every page access into an SQL database for real time analysis.
This information is useful to determine:
How people find the web site
If the information on this web site is organized in a useful manner
Links within the web site that may be broken
Web Traffic and trends to predict future growth of the service
Statistical data which is useful to our sponsors
Third Party Advertising
From time to time, this website hosts third party advertising (primarily Google Ads) in the form of text ads and banners. By placing these ads on our web pages, your activities may be tracked by the advertiser using cookies, beacons and other tracking methods which could permit that advertiser to associate your activities across multiple web sites and to personally identify your actions with information they gather from other sources.
We do not disclose any information to third parties that is personally identifiable.
Cookies
As of 5/26/2001, we are actively using cookies on the findanisp.com website. The use of cookies permits us to track the activites of individual users and how they have navigated through to the ISP websites. This information is critical to determine how users found our directory and whether they found the information here useful.
The site will function correctly with cookies inhibited, however it may make it more difficult for us to accurately measure how well the web site is functioning.
Most Browsers have the option to limit the conditions under which the browser will accept cookies from our web site and third party web sites. Consult your browser's help for specific details.
Disabling cookies will not prevent third party javascript code and beacons from tracking your actions, even with cookies completely turned off. Google knows all, sees all. Your privacy depends on your trust in their corporate ethic to Do No Evil....
Oh hold on, the Google Code of Conduct says "Don't Be Evil", not DO no evil. Evil people don't ever believe they are evil.
For additional details on the subject, perform a search on "Falun Gong google censorship", but using another search engine.

Submission of Rating information about an ISP is voluntary.
We require an email address with a rating to:
Permit us to contact you if we have questions about the information you've provided

Discourage anonymous unverifiable reports
