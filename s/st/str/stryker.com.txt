Please read the entire Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use before using or submitting information to any Stryker web site. Except as written in any other disclaimers, policies, user agreements, terms of use or other notices, this Privacy Statement and the Terms of Use are the complete agreement between you and Stryker with respect to your use of this site.

INTRODUCTION
The information we receive and how we use it depends on what you do when visiting our site. We collect and use your non-personal information (information that is not identifiable to you personally) differently than your personal information.
**WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION? **
Each time you visit this site to read or download information we may collect certain information about you from your computer. This information is collected from your computer's web browser and may include information such as the following ("non-personal information"):
• The type of web browser software you use (for example: Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.)
• The name of the domain from which you access the internet
• The internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site
• The date and time you access our site
• The pages you have visited on our site
• Information that has been de-identified
If you only read or download information on our site, we do not collect or learn your name, email address, home address or other personal information about you; however, certain non-personal or anonymous information may be passively collected (that is gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, internet tags or web beacons and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream, etc.). Your internet browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous information such as the URL of the web site you just came from and the internet protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. We may also place a text file called a cookie in the browser files of your computer when you visit. The cookie may be stored on your computer's hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information. U.S. Government Information Bulletin (I-034) contains a good description of cookie technology at: http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits but some parts of our site may not work properly for you if you do so. We will not allow third parties to place cookies on our site.
**WHAT DOES STRYKER DO WITH NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION? **
There are no restrictions to the way Stryker can use or share non-personal information. We will use non-personal information to help us make our site more useful to visitors and for other business purposes. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal information, we may share them with others. All information that is not personal to you or someone else, such as questions, comments, and suggestions (collectively "feedback") shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and Stryker shall be free to disclose and use the same, for any purpose and through any means, without any obligation whatsoever to you. By choosing to send a message to Stryker, you acknowledge that all feedback will be considered to be non-confidential. Stryker shall have no obligations of any kind with respect to such feedback and shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, exhibit, display, transform, commercialize, create derivative works and distribute the feedback to others without limitation.
Further, Stryker shall have no obligation to acknowledge and may not be prohibited from using any ideas, inventions, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such feedback or anything else you send to Stryker via the web site for any purpose whatsoever including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products incorporating such feedback.

When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional) as well as choose a user name and password.
