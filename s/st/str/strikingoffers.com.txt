Your Privacy at Striking Offers
Striking Offers is very serious about protecting your privacy. It has established this privacy policy to explain to you how your information is protected, collected and used, which may be updated by Striking Offers from time to time.
Protecting your privacy
We offer email anonymization by default to reduce 3rd party harvesting & spam. Only after a user elects to respond to another user will their email address be revealed.
We don’t run banner ads, pop ups, pop under, or any other kind of commercial ads.
We don’t share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.
We don’t engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites.
Striking Offers, or people who post on Striking Offers, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.

We may collect personal information if you post it in our listings, or if you contact us directly. Please do not provide any personal information on Striking Offers postings that you expect to keep private.

Data we store
All classified and forum postings are stored in our database, even after “deletion,” and may be archived elsewhere.
Our web logs and other records are stored indefinitely.
Although we make good faith efforts to store the information in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
