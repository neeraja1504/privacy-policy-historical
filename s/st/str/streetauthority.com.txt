This information may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and, in the case of a purchase, billing information. StreetAuthority uses registration and subscription information to maintain records about your use of our services, for billing purposes, and for us to occasionally send you information on products and services that we offer.

Subscriber and Site Visitor Surveys
From time-to-time we may also conduct surveys, although you don't have to respond to them. This research is compiled and analyzed only on an aggregated (group) basis. We do this to better understand our users' needs and improve their overall experience when using our service.
