_Web Browsing & Wireless Application Information _tells us about the websites you visit and the mobile applications you use.  It also helps us to assist you when ordering products or services; and

Your California Privacy Rights:
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell your personal information to other companies, and we will not share it with other companies for them to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent.
California Web Site Data Collection & "Do Not Track" Notices:
Web Site Data Collection: We do not knowingly allow other parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites when you use our websites and services.
"Do Not Track" Notice: Because internet and mobile network providers "do not track" and similar signals do not yet operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, Stream and the networks on which we operate currently do not respond to those signals. For more information on Do Not Track, please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with these requirements, or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us at legal@streamenergy.net, or write to us at Stream, 14675 Dallas Parkway, Suite 150, Dallas, Texas 75254.
Security:
As previously stated, Stream does not sell any information that personally identifies you.  We only keep the information for as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes.  After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or undecipherable.
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secured technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential.  Some other examples of technology we use to protect your information are:
Maintaining and protecting the security of computer storage and network equipment, and our security procedures require employee user names and passwords to access sensitive data;
Applying encryption or other appropriate security controls to protect personal identifying information when stored or transmitted by us;
Limiting access to personal identifying information to only those at Stream whose jobs require such access;
Requiring caller/online authentication before providing customer account information.  This way, only you or someone who knows your information will be able to access or change the information.
Although we strive to keep your personal identifying information secure, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that this information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of unauthorized intentional or unintentional acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy).
All of our employees are subject to the Stream Employee Handbook and certain state-mandated codes of conduct. Under the Stream Employee Handbook, all employees must follow the laws, rules, regulations, court and/or administrative orders that apply to our business. Specifically, this includes all legal requirements and Stream policies protecting the privacy of communications and the security and privacy of your records. We take this seriously, and any of our employees who fail to meet the standards in our handbook are subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
Finally, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that we have experienced a security breach and there is a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where notification is otherwise required by law.
Access to Your Information:
You may contact us ask to review the personal identifying information we have on file to make sure it is correct.
Future Changes:
In the event of a change in corporate ownership, information about our customers and users, including personal identifying information, may be shared and transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. This also applies in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which customer and user records would be transferred to another entity as a result of such a proceeding.
We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes we make and also to satisfy legal requirements. We will post a prominent notice of the change on our websites.  We will provide you with other appropriate notice of important changes at least 30 days before the effective date.
Cookies:
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites’ or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.  We use cookies to compile aggregate data about the site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.  We may contract with the third-party service providers to assist in better understanding our site visitors.  These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

Security:
Stream Energy will take all steps deemed reasonable by us to secure any personal information in our possession and to keep such data accurate and contemporary. Yet while we require our employees and service providers to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by our firm, it is not possible to give absolute assurance that the information provided to us will be secure at all times. Accordingly, Stream Energy will not be held responsible for incidents resulting from any unauthorized access to your personal information.

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI):

CPNI includes the types of telecommunications services you currently purchase, how you use them, and the billing information related to those services, including items such as the types of local, long distance and wireless telecommunications services that you have purchased and your calling details.

Stream uses technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of CPNI and protect it from unauthorized access or improper use. Stream does not disclose CPNI outside of the Stream companies or their agents without customer consent except as required or allowed by law.

Stream does not sell CPNI to unaffiliated third parties.

If you wish to restrict our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes, you may contact a customer service representative at the customer service phone number located on your Stream bill.
Restricting our use of your CPNI for marketing purposes will not affect the provision of any Stream products or services to which you subscribe, nor will it eliminate all types of Stream marketing contacts.
