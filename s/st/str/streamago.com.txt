When consulting this informative notice we invite you to keep in mind that, unless defined otherwise, capitalized terms shall have the same meaning as in the general terms of use of StreamagoApp, which we therefore invite you to read carefully.
Information on the collection and processing of personal data
Registration and Creation of the Account In order to use the Service, you must create your account on Streamago through the registration procedure. To do this you need to provide – also through third party services (e.g., Facebook) – personal data such as name, e-mail address, other information relating to your social graph etc.. Such data shall be used for the purposes connected to the use of the Service, and, in case of a specific authorization, also:
* To obtain general and specific information on User's preferences;
* To send information and commercial offers, also of third parties;
* To send advertising and informative material;
* For commercial communications, also interactive;
* For direct sale activities or activities aimed at the distribution of products and services;
* To develop studies and statistical research on sales, customers and other information, and communicate the latter to third parties if the case may be.
Navigation Data The IT systems that allow the functioning of the Service automatically acquire, in their day-to-day functioning, certain personal data that are implicitly transmitted while using web communications protocols. If processed with data owned by third parties, such data may identify the users/visitors. Some examples are IP addresses and domain names of terminals used by the users/visitors which use the Service. If the User activates the geo-location feature, also data related to the location of the User shall be acquired. Such information shall be used to facilitate the use of the Service and may be collected and managed anonymously for statistical surveys. Cookies Like many websites and applications, also StreamagoApp uses cookies, which are small text files sent by the Server of Streamago Inc.'s website or partner to the User's browser and automatically stored on the User's computer. The main purpose of such cookies is to make the Service more accessible and we therefore suggest you instruct your browser to accept them. During the first access to Streamago's website the User shall be informed that by continuing to navigate the website he gives his consent to the use of cookies. If the User wishes to block cookies, he can instruct the browser to change the relevant setting. Please be informed that blocking cookies may impact the use of the Service. There are various types of cookies: (i) “session” cookies, mainly used to facilitate the use of the Service, which are downloaded and then deleted once the Browser is closed; (ii) “persistent” cookies which are stored on the user/visitor's hard disk until they expire; and (iii) “profiling” cookies used for purposes other than those of a technical nature, such as advertising. Persistent and profiling cookies can always be disabled (opt-out) also if they are anonymous, i.e., they do not collect personal information which could lead to the identification of the user (e.g., IP address). In this regard it should be underlined that the browser data that may be identified ( personally identifiable information : PII) through cookies cannot lead back to the user and are not stored. Instead, session cookies are mainly used during the authentication, authorization and navigation stages, accessed through the registration. Furthermore, Streamago uses third party cookies and to this end invites you to consult the privacy policies of such third parties which can be accessed through the following links:
