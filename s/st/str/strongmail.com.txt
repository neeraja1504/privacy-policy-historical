Client Data is governed as described in  ** Section III (Client Data)** of this Privacy Policy.
III.  CLIENT DATA
3.1  Client Agreement. Our Clients engage Selligent to perform Services for them under a services agreement. All Personal Data that we process in order to provide Services to our Clients is collectively, “Client Data”.

3.3  Selligent as Processor. Selligent is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all Client Data. This  ** Section III (Client Data)**  explains our practices with regard to all of the Client Data we process for our Clients, including any reports, analyses or other materials we generate for our Clients which rely on or reference to such Client Data, including:
(a)  SaaS product(s ). Client will provide, through Client’s use of an On Demand/Cloud service, Client Data collected by Client (not by Selligent) respecting the individual(s) or entity(ies) Client wish to contact using the Service(s) being provided to Client. In addition, if ordered by Client, the Services may collect Client Data for Client concerning the behavioral use by an individual or entity in Client’s campaign(s), which may associate certain preferences with an email address or other Personal Data,  and adjust a Client’s campaign in its contact with such individual(s).
(b)  Hosted social/viral product(s ). As part of its Services, Selligent hosts technology that enables Clients to seek and share information from their customers, clients and/or users, including information that a user may share about others (“friends”). The information entered may reside in the forms of addresses for email and other electronic delivery format(s), which addresses may reveal a name and/or personal characteristic that such person has represented in the address format. In addition, depending on the interface, campaign and message created by the Client, those entering information, including individuals, may enter information revealing their first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, and other information that can identify them, as well as email addresses and other information regarding friends.
(c)  Reports.  In addition, Selligent will report to its Clients aggregated anonymous data pertaining to Clients, Client Data or the companies and individuals who are customers or clients of a Client that participated in a campaign, including without limitation generically the number of contacts in a participant’s email address book (but not any content, which Selligent will not collect nor store unless the user requests that the Selligent product or service collect and enter such information for such user to share a message).
It is the responsibility of each Selligent Client to use such anonymous information only in accordance with its Privacy Policy practices, applicable law and/or express permission. Selligent will not sell, market, or distribute any Personal Data in any way to any third party(ies), except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy or in a specific agreement in accordance with applicable law(s). Any user may decline to provide Personal Data by choosing not to participate in a program offered by a Selligent Client, or their users. Alternatively, anyone may elect to opt out of receiving any further message in a campaign or respecting other future communications from a Selligent Client and/or user by replying to the message with an unsubscribe request according to the instructions provided with the campaign message.
3.4  Sharing of Client Data. Selligent will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Client Data except as provided in the services agreement with Client and as provided in this  Section III :
(a)  Selligent will disclose Client Data of a particular Client to such Client and to other entities or individuals when instructed by the Client.
(b)  We may disclose Client Data to our affiliates and service providers as needed to provide the Services that our Client has requested. These entities are all contractually bound to limit use of Client Data as needed to perform the Services.

Selligent acknowledges that individuals have the right to access receive a copy of, and/or other rights as provided for by applicable legislation, regulations or decrees with respect to their Personal Data.  If Personal Data pertaining to you as an individual is Client Data, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have with respect to such Personal Data, including right to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with our Client directly. Because Selligent personnel have limited ability to access the Client Data submitted by our Clients as part of our Services, if you wish to make your request directly to Selligent, please provide the name of Client who submitted your data to our Services.  We will refer your request to that Client, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
3.7  International Transfer of Client Data.
(a) Location of Client Data. With limited exceptions, our Client Data is maintained in the region (NA or EEA) where the Client is located. However, some Client Data from Clients may be processed in a region other than where Client is located.
(b) Transfer. We may transfer personal Client Data pertaining to individuals outside the United States or the EU to our affiliates and service providers in the United States and elsewhere in the world. These transfers are happening under the appropriate legal mechanisms in compliance with the relevant data protection rules on transfers (Privacy shield, Standard Contractual Clauses, etc.).
(c)  Global Support. In the performance of an agreement with a Client, Selligent provides global support to such Client on a 24/7 basis. Selligent may access Client Data that resides on a server or cloud from any location where its customer support representatives are located. Support via ticketing will be automated and sent to the call center that is active, and calls to the call center will also be directed accordingly on a 24-hour basis.  U.S. support center will have access to European Client Data, and our Europe support center will have access to US Client Data.

3.8  Client’s Responsibilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any service agreement with Client or otherwise, it is the Client’s sole responsibility to provide and abide by its own online information practices, including its privacy policy, including presenting verbatim or a summary of the practices set forth in this section by way of privacy policy, and to use and share with Selligent only information it has authority to use in the manner used (by either permission or applicable law).  Selligent is not responsible to initiate the collection of information except as expressly agreed with a Client and Selligent is not responsible for verifying the integrity, lawfulness and reliability of the Client Data. With regard to any Special Category Personal Data (“Special Category Personal Data” includes Personal Data regarding a person's race, ethnicity, political beliefs, trade union membership, religious or similar beliefs, physical or mental health, genetic or biometric data, sexual life, sexual orientation or criminal record), and to the extent permitted by any DPA or other contractual agreement in place between Selligent and Client, it is the Client’s responsibility to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations when collecting and processing such data, including with regard to the submission to Selligent for processing, and the processing performed by the Client on Selligent’s platform.
As part of the Services, contact details may be used to send notifications and follow-up messages regarding a promotion being run by a Client, and it is Client’s responsibility to use such hosted information only as authorized by its own privacy policy, online information practices, applicable law(s) and/or express permission.

IV.   INFORMATION WE COLLECT
4.1   Voluntarily Provided. Other than Client Data which was obtained and processed by Selligent as provided in  ** Section III (Client Data)** , we obtain Personal Data about you as a Visitor, a prospective business contact or Client if you choose to provide it.  For example, if you contact our email mailboxes or you are listed as the contact person for certain Services ordered by a Client or if you create a profile for a Client account. In some cases, you may have previously provided your Personal Data to Selligent (if, for example, you are a former Client). In addition, some pages on our Website may ask the Visitor to provide information, including Personal Data in order to receive communications, documents, or information about an event. Such information may include: name; email address; physical location/address; entity affiliation; and information about intended or desired use, interests, and preferences.
By submitting Personal Data to Selligent, you understand and acknowledge that Selligent uses this Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Note that for some information and in the context of a set of specific purposes, you may also require an explicit opt-in.
Your Personal Data is not used for other purposes, unless we obtain your permission, or unless otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. For example, if you send us an email message requesting information about Selligent, we will use your email address and other information you supply to respond to your request.  If you send us a resume to apply online for a position with Selligent, we will use the information that you provide to match you with available Selligent job opportunities. Where we ask for use your Personal Data for additional purposes, we will ask your permission for this at the point of collection.
Selligent generally collects only the Personal Data necessary to fulfill your request. Where additional, optional information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection and where applicable, unless this Personal Data is required for the performance of a contract or the follow-up of precontractual requests, explicit consent will be requested.
Other than Client Data which may contain Special Category Personal Data which is processed by Selligent as provided in  ** Section III (Client Data)**, Selligent only collects Special Category Personal Data when the relevant individuals voluntarily provide us with this information or where such information is required or permitted to be collected by law or professional standards.
Please use your discretion when providing Sensitive Personal Data to Selligent, and under any circumstances, do not provide Sensitive Personal Data to Selligent, unless you thereby explicitly consent to Selligent's use of that information for its legitimate business purposes and consent to the transfer and storage of such information to and in _  Selligent databases. If you have any questions about whether the provision of Sensitive Personal Data to Selligent is, or may be, necessary or appropriate for particular purposes, please contact Selligent as provided in _ ** _ Section XIV (Your Comments and Questions)__** ._
4.2  Automatic Collection of Personal Data.
In some instances, Selligent and its service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to automatically collect certain types of information when our Websites are accessed, or when Client uses the Services, or through emails that Selligent may exchange with a Visitor or Client.
The collection of this information allows us to customize a Visitor’s or Client’s online experience; improve the performance, usability and effectiveness of the Services; advertise and market our services; measure the effectiveness of our marketing activities; and generate and analyze statistics about our Clients use our Services.
(a)  IP Address/log information. When Visitors or Clients visit any of our Websites, we may collect (automatically log) their IP address (the unique address identifying a computer on the Internet) and standard web log information, such as browser type and the pages accessed on our Websites. The IP address will be automatically recognized by our servers. We may also use this information in aggregate form to maintain and improve our Websites and the Services and to generate and analyze statistics about our Websites and the Services and our Clients’ use of the Services (under legitimate interest, i.e. the freedom to do business)
(b)  Cookies. When our Websites are accessed, “cookies” may be placed by or for us on the visiting computer. When a Client accesses a Service by logging in using a password and/or user ID, we send a "session cookie" to that computer. This type of cookie helps us recognize visits to multiple pages on the Websites during the same session, so that we don't need to ask for a password on each page. Once a registered Client has logged out or a browser is closed, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect. We may also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display an email address on a sign-in form, to avoid the need to retype the email address on each log in to a Client account. We encode our cookies so that we can interpret the information stored in them.  You are free to decline our cookies if the browser permits, but doing so may interfere with use of our Websites.
(c)   Do Not Track.  Our Services may not recognize browser-based Do Not Track signals. However, as discussed above under “Cookies,” you may be able to modify your browser settings to block all cookies, or to block “third-party” cookies. Cookies that we set on our Services are considered “first-party” cookies. Details on your ability to restrict or change the Personal Data that we may collect about you are listed below  ** Section XII (Your Choices, Including Opt-Out Options)**  of this Privacy Policy.
(d)  Usage Analytics. Selligent uses several third-party usage analytics tools including Google Analytics. More information about how Google Analytics is used by Selligent can be found here:  ** http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html**.
To provide Visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the Services or to other web analytics services.
(e)   Location-based tools. Selligent may collect and use the geographical location of a Visitor’s or Client’s computer or mobile device. Selligent will obtain the explicit consent of the Visitor or Client prior to collection of such information if legally or contractually required to do so.  With respect to the collection of precise information about the location of a Visitor or Client’ mobile device, once the Visitor or Client has consented to the collection, the consent may be adjusted by them by managing your location services preferences through the settings of the mobile device they are using.  This location data is collected for the purpose of providing Visitors and Clients with information regarding Services which we believe may be of interest to Visitors or Clients based on your geographic location, and to improve our location-based Services.
(f)  Web beacons. Selligent or its service providers may use web beacons (i.e., small image files on a web page that can be used to collect certain information from your computer, such as an IP address, the time the content was viewed, a browser type, and the existence of cookies previously set by the same server) to track the effectiveness of third party web sites that provide us with recruiting or marketing services or to gather aggregate visitor statistics and manage cookies. Selligent only uses web beacons in accordance with applicable laws.
If you reject the cookies associated with some web beacons, you can render them web beacons unusable, although the web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address but cookie information will not be recorded.
In some of our communications with prospects, Visitors or Clients, we may monitor recipient actions such as email open rates through embedded links within the messages. We collect this information to gauge interest in our Services, and to maintain and improve them.
(g)   Social media widgets and applications. The Services may include functionality to enable sharing via third party social media applications (such as the “Like” button on Facebook® and the widget on Twitter®). These social media applications may collect and use information regarding your use of the Services. Please be aware that certain of the Personal Data that you provide via such social media applications may be collected and used by other members of that social media application and such interactions are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide the application. We do not have control over, or responsibility for, those companies or their use of your information.
In addition, Selligent may include blogs, forums, crowd-sourcing and other applications or services on its Websites or in social media, in its Services or otherwise online (collectively “social media features”). The purpose of social media features is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and content. Any Personal Data that you provide on any Selligent social media feature may be shared with other users of that social media feature (unless otherwise stated at the point of collection), over whom we may have limited or no control.
4.3  If You Become a Client Through an Agreement.
When you are a Client, in addition to the information collected as described in  Section 4.1  and  4.2 , we also collect the types of information described in this  Section 4.3.  As described in  ** Section III (Client Data), as part of providing the Services, we also may collect Client Data about your customers, and their clients and/or end users (including information they share about others). Client Data will be collected, used, shared and protected as set forth below and in  ** Section III (Client Data).
Before permitting a Client to use a product or service, we may require such Client to provide information we can use to verify the Client’s and user’s identity, address or location, or to manage risk.
Such information may include without limitation, bank or credit card account information for automatic payments, taxpayer ID number, ID card or passport information or physical location of server(s).
We may also obtain information about a Client from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. When a Client is using a Service, we may collect information about a Client’s computer or other access devices for fraud prevention purposes. Clients will also provide Selligent with identifying information to set up and administer the Services, including authorized user identification information, and business and technical contact information, which will be used to perform the Services.
4.4  Employees.
We receive information, including Personal Data when you apply for a job in the “employment” section of the Website, or through another channel. Any such information gathered in relationship thereto will be used solely to evaluate whether your background and experience make you a candidate for a career with us.
We may also receive information from our Client’s users as a result of participation in online learning programs through use of Selligent’s Learning Management System (“LMS”), including email address and other contact information and scoring.
The information from the LMS system is stored in the United States, with consent of the Client’s users.
4.5  Blog/Message Board, email, etc.
To the extent Selligent makes available any forum for public comment, such as a blog, message board or chat space, contributors should be aware that any profile information disclosed by them is available to all users of the applicable forum, and is thus neither private nor confidential.
Selligent cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed or communicated online in such fora, and contributors disclose any such information entirely at their own risk.
Selligent reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, to remove any content a poster may post on a blog, message board or chat space and restrict subsequent access to any such forum. Selligent further reserves the right to republish any posting to any such forum elsewhere on the Internet in any format. When Selligent is contacted via email, we answer by sending an email response to the sender.
We also store the email we receive for compliance with a legal obligation or to the extend it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry.
We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so.
4.6  Additional.
Finally, we may collect Personal Data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy.
For example, we may collect information when you respond to a survey, set your preferences, contact us through customer services or by other means, enter a contest or sweepstakes or participate in another promotional or information gathering activity.  Any information collected through these methods shall be used as provided in any announcement related to such item(s) and if none, then in accordance with  ** Section IV 4.1 (Voluntarily Provided)** and provided there is an appropriate legal ground for such collection (e.g.: consent, execution of a contract, legitimate interest, i.e. the freedom to do business,…).
V.  How We Use Personal Data
Use in General. We use the information (including Personal Data) we collect from or about Visitors and Clients (including without limitation, through technologies such as those described in  Section IV 4.3  (Automatic Collection of Personal Data) primarily to provide better customer service to Clients, to improve and customize the content Visitors and Clients see, to help recognize Visitors and Clients when you use other devices, to provide the Services requested by Clients, and to contact Visitors and Clients about special promotions and new Services and for purposes including the following:
provide Services and client support upon Clients request or order;
administering orders and accounts relating to our suppliers or Clients;
process transactions and send notices about Client agreements, the Services or a Client’s transactions;
resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our agreements with Clients and our Acceptable Use Policy(ies ) and those of contracted third parties of which Clients and Visitors have been made aware;
customize, measure, and improve our products, services and the content and delivery of our Services and Website(s);
provide information about Services and events, programs or surveys, send Clients and Visitors targeted marketing, product and/or service update notices, and promotional offers based on the communication preferences of Visitors and Clients;
Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties;

Send information to a Client’s contacts if we are asked to do so by a Client; and
Perform data analyses (including market and consumer search, trend analysis, financial analysis and anonymization and aggregation of Personal Data).
The legal ground of this processing is either the necessity for the performance of the contract,  for pre-contractual discussion or the legitimate interest derived from the freedom to do business.
In most cases, Visitors who voluntarily provide information will receive a personalized message from one of our sales representatives with more information about the communication, document, or event, or our Services, via phone or email. If the Visitor has opted in to receive email communications from Selligent during contact with our Websites or sales representative, the Visitor will receive regular communications from Selligent until opting out using one of the clearly specified methods in the email communication.
Client Data will be used and protected as set forth in  ** Section III (Client Data)**.
VI.   Where and How We Store, Process and Protect Personal Data
Personal Data collected is stored and processed on computers in the United States, Europe and other countries and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal, state and EU or local laws and regulations.
We maintain adequate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
When processed as part of a hosted service, the information may be processed and stored on the servers of third party providers hired to provide the hosting, and our agreements with such parties require that they not use, disclose, or share such information except in line with Section VII below.
Despite Selligent's best efforts, however, security cannot be absolutely guaranteed against all threats. To the best of our ability, access to your Personal Data is limited to those who have a need to know. Those individuals who have access to the Personal Data are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. We also make reasonable efforts to retain Personal Data only for so long as the information is necessary to comply with an individual's request or until that person asks that the information be deleted, or as necessary for the performance of the Services to our Clients.
Client Data will be protected as set forth in  ** Section III (Client Data).**
VII.  How We Share Personal Data with Third Parties
Selligent will not sell or rent any of your Personal Data to third parties in the normal course of doing business and only shares your Personal Data with third parties and service providers as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your Personal Data with

Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented.
