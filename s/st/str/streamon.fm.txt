Collection of your Personal Information
We may request that you enter certain personal information about yourself, including your email address, phone number, and/or home address into our Site.
Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the Site. If you sign up for an aspect of our Site that involves tracking personally identifiable information, we may also collect personally identifiable information from other internet sources and database services. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for an aspect of our Site that requires it.
We may also record information about users’ use of our Site, such as local internet address, click history, the times and dates at which users access our Site, the particular portions of the Site used, and the details of any transactions conducted using the Site. Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you use the Site. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Site, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Site.

How We May Use or Disclose Your Personal Information
We will use your personal information to authenticate your access to our Site. We will only disclose your personal information to third parties in furtherance of transactions into which you elect to enter using our Site.
Your personal information will remain solely within our secure system and will not be disclosed to any of our partners, or any other third parties. We may, however, combine your personal information with that of our other users in a consolidated database from which we may extract aggregated information, which is statistical information about our users as a group not containing any personally identifiable information about you or any other individual user. We may disclose the aggregated information referenced above to third parties for their use.
We may use your personal information to contact you to inform you of changes to the Site, or to otherwise communicate with you about issues regarding the Site. To opt-out of all further contact initiated by us, email us at any time at support@futurimedia.com .
We may contact you to offer you the opportunity to avail yourself of new or additional products services, which contact may be construed as marketing. You may later opt-out of receiving marketing-related communications from us by sending an email to: support@futurimedia.com .
We may disclose your individual personal information if compelled to do so by law, governmental rule or regulation, judicial process, or court order. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets or equity, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Site, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on our Site.
We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Site (the “Analytical Data”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Site users.

We may automatically collect and receive certain information from your computer or mobile device, including your access and/or use of the Site, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see “Cookies and Related Technologies” below). For example, each time you access the Site, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came (if applicable), the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “traffic data”). We may link this traffic data to your unique Site user ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Site, and better understand and market to our customers and Site users.
We also make use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Site with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Site. This also includes where we track certain metrics. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms of Use.
