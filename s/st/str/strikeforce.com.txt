A child’s parent has the option to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties, but if such disclosure is necessary to make available a service which has been requested, then the child will not have access to such service. Children will not be permitted to provide personal information via the Strikeforce Site or to sign up for Public Activities online.
