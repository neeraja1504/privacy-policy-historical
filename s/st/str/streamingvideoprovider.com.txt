This information is collected by most websites and is used to optimize your experience on the Site.
Job Applicants : You may voluntarily provide data about yourself in connection with a job application. Such provision of data is subject to the privacy policy of the third-party platform you use to submit your application. You will have the opportunity to review that privacy policy before providing the data.
Cookies and other tracking technologies. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about you, such as personal information, information about the devices you use to access the Site and your interactions with the Site. For more information about the use of cookies on the Site, please review our Cookies Policy.
We may also use web beacons on our Site and in email communications. Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we, or our third-party service providers, place on our Site and in emails. Alongside cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page on the Site, or opened or acted upon an email. This information allows us to measure the performance of our Site and our email campaigns.
Advertising on Third-Party Websites and Ad Networks. We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on the Site and third-party websites, which may include serving or tracking advertisements on or relating to the Site. Our third-party service providers may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on the Site and third-party sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. The privacy policies of those third parties will govern your interactions with such third-party websites or ad networks. If you do not want this information used by third parties for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if you are located in the European Union, click here). Following these processes will opt you out of receiving StreamingVideoProvider ads that are targeted to you. You may, however, continue to receive generic ads that are targeted to the general public.

This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on the Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the device you are using by your ISP and, in many cases, IP addresses are shared by multiple people or computers and may be dynamically generated (meaning they change over time). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you use the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) you visited. We may combine this automatically-collected log information with other information we collect from you. We do this to improve the functionality of the Site.
Analytics. We use third-party analytics provided by Google Analytics. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes information about you and information on how to opt out from Google’s collection of information from you, please click here.
Do Not Track. The Site does not recognize a “do not track” setting (or similar mechanism) from your browser to indicate that you do not wish to be tracked or to receive interest-based ads.
Security. The security of personal information that StreamingVideoProvider collects from Site users is of great importance to StreamingVideoProvider. We use organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control. No data transmission over the Internet or data storage system, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. When you submit personal information via a lead form on the Site (such as name, phone number, and email address), we encrypt the transmission of that information. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at privacy@streamingvideoprovider.com.

Information We May Collect
Information Collected from Viewers. In connection with our provision of StreamingVideoProvider Services, we may collect certain information about Viewers (Viewers can be our customer's website viewers or our customer's customer's viewers in a scenario when our customer is acting as white-label reseller of StreamingVideoProvider Services). Such information may include personal information, which is information that identifies an individual or relates to identifiable person. Information that may be collected when videos are viewed via StreamingVideoProvider Services includes:
Unique IDs such as IP addresses or device ID.
Viewer name, address, email address, title and industry or any other custom data our Customer may choose to collect from Viwers. Note that StreamingVideoProvider collects this information about Viewers only if a Customer elects to use certain features of StreamingVideoProvider Services (such as Audience Forms, External Uploaders with Metadata forms, Pay-Per-View) that are intended to collect such information.
System information, such as device, browser and operating system type and version, screen resolution and preferred language.
Referring domain, destination domain and destination path.
Video-viewing activity, such as player loads, number of views, viewed minutes, percent of content viewed, new Viewers, unique Viewers, attention span, top domains, geography, traffic sources, search terms and other similar information. This information is aggregated and anonymized (meaning it is not connected to an individual Viewer).
Geolocation data.
Other personal information of a natural person that may be included in videos or other data that is uploaded to StreamingVideoProvider Services.
Information Collected from Customers.   To enable us to effectively provide StreamingVideoProvider Services, we may collect the following information from individuals authorized by Customers (such as a Customer’s employees) to use StreamingVideoProvider Services:
Name, business email address, business telephone number, company, title and business billing address and payment information.
Login credentials.
Information Collected from Customer’s Customers.   To enable us to effectively provide white-label StreamingVideoProvider Services, we may collect the following information from customers who are customers of our Customers when using StreamingVideoProvider Services:
Name, business email address, business telephone number, company, title and business billing address and payment information.
Login credentials.
Communication preferences.
Unique IDs such as IP address and device IDs.
Geolocation data.
Other personal information of a natural person that may be included in videos or other data that is uploaded to StreamingVideoProvider Services.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies. We, and our third-party service providers, may use technologies such as cookies and beacons to quantify use, analyze viewing and engagement with videos displayed using StreamingVideoProvider Services, conduct benchmarking, generate metrics, report to Customers and assess the quality of StreamingVideoProvider Services.
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personal information we obtain from your use of StreamingVideoProvider Services. StreamingVideoProvider Services may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions of StreamingVideoProvider Services.
Web Beacons. We may also use web beacons, tags and scripts in connection with StreamingVideoProvider Services. Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that StreamingVideoProvider Services use to communicate analytics data on Viewer activity and service usage. Alongside cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique Viewers who have viewed a video and activity during a viewing session. This information enables us to measure the performance of our Customer’s videos and allows Customers to evaluate Viewer interaction with their video content.
HTTP Headers.   HTTP headers are information that is transmitted whenever a webpage is viewed, and contain technical information required for communication between a browsing device and a website server. Other electronic communication protocols (such as those used for email) also use headers to transmit information. Information may be transmitted through HTTP (or other electronic communication protocol) headers to StreamingVideoProvider from the Customer’s use of StreamingVideoProvider Services or from Viewer interaction with a Customer's video. This may include information about the device browser, the requested webpage and the computer or device being used (such as a carrier or device identifier).
Log Files. As is true of most online services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Viewer IP address, browser type, device type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data. An IP address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a Customer uses StreamingVideoProvider Services or a Viewer watches a video, along with the time(s) of the visit(s) and the page(s) visited. We may combine this automatically-collected log information with other information we collect. We do this to provide analytics data to our Customers, to improve the functionality of StreamingVideoProvider Services and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Analytics. We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to track the use of StreamingVideoProvider Services by our Customers. For information on how Google collects and processes information and how to opt out from Google’s collection of your information, please click here.
Do Not Track. StreamingVideoProvider Services do not recognize if a browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate the user does not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads.
Security.   The security of personal information that StreamingVideoProvider collects while operating the StreamingVideoProvider Service is of great importance to StreamingVideoProvider. We use organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control. No data transmission over the Internet or data storage system, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at privacy@streamingvideoprovider.com.

StreamingVideoProvider does not have access to full credit card numbers and does not store such information in its own systems. Information transmitted to the Payment Service is encrypted using SSL technology. The Payment Service is required to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and the rules and regulations issued by the payment card industry and the credit card companies.

Cross- Device Tracking. When Customers or Viewers use devices to display and/or view a Customer’s video content, we may receive information about their devices, including a unique identifier for each device. We and our service providers and third parties we collaborate with, including ad networks, may use cross-device/cross-context tracking. For example, a Viewer might use multiple browsers on a single device, or use various devices (such as desktops, smartphones and tablets), which can result in the individual having multiple accounts or profiles across these various contexts and devices. Cross-device/cross-context technology may be used to connect these various accounts or profiles and the corresponding data from the different contexts and devices.
Aggregate Information. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may use, process, transfer and store any data about Viewers and Customers in an anonymous (or pseudonymous) and aggregated manner. We may combine personal information with other information, collected online and offline, including information from third-party sources. We may also use information in other ways with consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. By using StreamingVideoProvider Services, our Customers agree that we may collect, use, share and store anonymized (or pseudonymized) aggregated data collected through StreamingVideoProvider Services for benchmarking, analytics, metrics, research, reporting, machine learning and other legitimate business purposes.
Automated Decisions. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may collect data in an automated manner and make automated decisions, including using machine-learning algorithms, about Viewers and Customers in order to provide and/or optimize StreamingVideoProvider Services, for security or analytics purposes and for any other lawful purpose.
