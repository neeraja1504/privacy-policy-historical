• Provide you with services and information, through e-mails from MP, the Site, your electronic devices, Apps and Software;
• Provide customer service;
• Conduct research and perform analysis in order to measure, maintain, protect, develop and improve our Services;
• Administer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys and provide appropriate notifications;
• Communicate with you about special offers, events, or new products or services that may be of interest to you;
• Customize and enhance the Services;
• Make communications necessary to notify you regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues; and
• Manage our business.
Clarity
We strive to communicate clearly about your privacy and how we handle your personal information.
Security
We follow security standards, processes and procedures that are designed to protect your personal information.
Integrity
We do not sell or rent your personal information and respect your preferences with respect to your personal information.
What is the personal information that we collect?
When you create an Account we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”), such as your email address, username and password. If you purchase a subscription to use the Services, we (or our third party payment processor e.g. PayPal ®) may also collect billing information such as your credit card information and billing address.
Your User Content
We collect and store the User Content you upload, stream or access via the Services.
Information Collected Using Cookies.
We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; and (3) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners displayed. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.
Information Related to Use of the Services.
Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, links on our Services that a User clicked on, duration of use of the Services, Content playback time, the amount of storage used in a User’s Account, the amount of Content a User accesses via the Services, the number of times our Services are used and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
We use service providers such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to increase our Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to our Site and our mobile applications meet the criteria required to process their requests. Accordingly, Log Data is shared with Google and Mixpanel, which have their own privacy policies (accessible at www.google.com/policies/privacy/ and https://mixpanel.com/privacy/, respectively) addressing how each party uses such information.
Location Information.
When you use our App we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation.
Most of mobile devices allow you to switch off the geolocation feature. If you do not wish that data regarding your location be collected, stored and processed by MP, you should modify the personal settings of your mobile device.
BY DOING BUSINESS WITH OR INTERACTING WITH MP, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE OF THE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
Inviting Friends to use the Services or Access User Content.
Account holders can invite their friends to use the Services via their Accounts in connection with our Referral Program. Account holders can also send invitations to their friends to obtain access to User Content collections. In connection with these features of the Services, Account holders may connect their Accounts with their accounts with certain third-party services such as Facebook (each, a “Third Party Account”) to enable Account holders to contact their friends and contacts via such Third Party Accounts. If an Account holder chooses to connect with a Third Party Account via the Services, the Account holder may have to provide us with his or her username (or userID) so that his or her identity can be authenticated by the Third Party Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to access certain information such as lists of Third Party Account friends or contacts and other information that the Account holder’s privacy settings on the Third Party Account permit us to access in order to present such friends or contacts to the Account holder via the Services, as applicable. We don’t receive or store passwords for any Third Party Accounts. Alternatively, if an Account holder provides MP with the email address of a friend, a message will be sent from MP to such friend on the applicable Account holders’ behalf, inviting the friend to use the Services.  These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the one-time communication to the friends and for analyzing the success of this feature of the Services. Invited friends may request that MP delete their PII by contacting us at theteam@streamnation.com. In any case, after 6 months, email addresses of friends who have not created an Account will be automatically deleted from our system.
What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?
We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described in this Policy:
Your Use of the Services.

Such User Content will be accessible in connection with your Account user name.
Information Shared with Our Services Providers.
We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.
It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties.

The Security of Your Information
We take significant and appropriate measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards, processes and procedures that are designed to protect your personal information, you must remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and so we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your personal information at all times and in all circumstances.

To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.
Modifying Your Information
You can access at reasonable intervals and at no charge the PII we process, the purpose of the processing, the categories of personal information we process as well as the third parties to whom your PII may be communicated.

International Transfer
You acknowledge and hereby explicitly agree that your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. For example, we may transfer your PII to the European Union and process it there.
