This notice covers personal data collected via the University’s website (www.strath.ac.uk), e.g. if you submit a query etc. If you engage with the University for other purposes via our website e.g. apply to study, complete a web-form to attend an Open Day etc. you will be provided with a more detailed privacy notice in relation to that process/service. This is to increase transparency and to ensure you understand how your information will be used. Any additional privacy notices supplement this central notice.
