By registering with, creating an account, accessing and/or otherwise using the Sites, or otherwise submitting your contact information to receive more information from us through the Sites (“Services”), you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy or the Privacy Policy of any SEI subsidiary website to the extent such Privacy Policy conflicts with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Sites.
This Privacy Policy may be changed by us from time to time without notice to you and the governing version will be posted on the Sites. Please review the posted terms on a regular basis as your use of the Sites will be governed by the then-current Privacy Policy.

5. Use of Your Personal Data. Your Analytical Information may be used to help us improve our Sites by enabling us to discover and address the needs of our Sites’ visitors. This includes making our Sites accessible to the variety of Web browsers and operating systems used to access our Sites.
Personal Data (Contact Information and Analytical Information) collected through the Sites is used for the purpose of responding to your requests for information about our products and services or to contact you about our future products and services.

Subject to applicable laws, in the event that part or all of Strategic Education, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries are bought, sold or otherwise transferred, or is in the process of a potential transaction, your Personal Data may be shared for evaluation purposes and included among the transferred business assets.
We may also disclose specific information when such disclosure appears necessary to comply with the law, a subpoena or other litigation process or to protect the interests or safety of visitors and customers, employees, students, learners, or others. This includes exchanging your Personal Data with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may disclose your Personal Data if we need to share your information to provide the products or service you have requested or we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Strategic Education or any of its subsidiaries to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Personal Data we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us). Further, we may disclose your Personal Data as necessary to protect us or our Sites’ users if we find that your actions on our website violate any of our usage guidelines for specific services or any agreement.

We use commercially reasonable efforts based upon the type and sensitivity of information being stored to protect the security of Personal Data collected through the Sites. Financial transactions submitted through the Sites are encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete the information from our databases and not use such information for any purpose, except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law.
