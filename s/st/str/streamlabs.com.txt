Our policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when we have your permission to do so. Occasionally, we may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, donation trends, user growth, etc.) with our partners and other interested parties. This information will never identify any individual personally or contain any personally identifiable information.
Streamlabs does not sell, lease, share, rent, or otherwise provide any personally identifiable information for marketing purposes to any companies or persons outside of Streamlabs. We may provide your personally identifiable information to service providers and affiliates that provide services in conjunction with our offerings, such as payment processors, fraud protection services, or other parties assisting in improving Streamlabs. Information is securely transmitted to these affiliates, and such affiliates will only receive information necessary to provide their respective services and will be bound by confidentiality agreements limiting the use of such information. Please be aware that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display in any public location through the use of our platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.
Streamlabs will only disclose personally identifiable information to government officials and law enforcement agencies when it is required by law (e.g. in compliance with a subpoena or court order) or if we believe in good faith that such action is appropriate and necessary to protect and defend the rights of Streamlabs, or to protect the safety of Streamlabs users, employees, affiliates, and the general public.
In the event that Streamlabs or some or all assets related to our services are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign any information we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

Links
The Streamlabs website contains links to other sites that are not under our direct control.

Information collected by such technologies will be disclosed to or collected by these services providers, who use this information to evaluate your use of Streamlabs. You may choose to opt out of their services if you do not wish to have your information collected by them.
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web brosers. DNT is a way for users to tell websites and services that they do not want certain information about their visits collected. We currently do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals at this time though, as the Internet industry is currently working towards accepted standardization and practices around DNT.
Data Security
Streamlabs has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your information. While we take precautions to protect sensitive information that’s transmitted online, we also protect your information offline . Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, such as billing or customer service, are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/serves in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
Please note that while we continually make every effort to implement safeguards to protect your personal information, the very nature of the Internet makes it impossible to guarantee the security of transmitted data. Streamlabs makes no warranties or representations as to the security and confidentiality of any data you transmit. Any data you transmit to Streamlabs is at your own risk, and we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
