Vida Shoes International, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Vida," "we," or "us") is committed to the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected from users of the Vida website, http://www.stridetrite.com (the "Website"), and how that information is used and disclosed. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions of Use, which governs your use of the Website in general.

We will notify users of such changes by posting a revised Privacy Policy on this page. Such changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Policy to this Website. We encourage you to check back periodically so that you are always aware of any such changes.
1. What categories of personal information do we collect on or through the website and how is it collected?
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means "personally identifiable information", i.e., individually identifiable information about an individual consumer collected online by the Website from that individual and maintained by us in an accessible form. Personal Information includes but is not limited to a person's first and last name, physical address, zip code, email address, phone/fax number, and/or social security number, as more particularly described under applicable U.S. privacy laws.
Personal Information is and/or may be collected from you in a number of ways, including:
when you create/update a user account;
when you subscribe to our email newsletter or mailing list;
when you participate in a survey, sweepstakes, contest or other promotion through the website;
when you contact customer service by email for any reason (for example, contacting Vida to provide your comments/feedback and/or concerns about current and or previous orders);
when you communicate with us via thirdparty social media sites;
when you submit personal information through photos, posts, comments, messages and/or stories for our potential use and/or publication; and
when you place an order or make a purchase from Vida ecommerce. as part of the buying/selling process, we will collect your full name, billing and shipping addresses, email address, phone number, credit card number, expiration date and potentially other information such as demographic information, gender, birthday or personal interests.
In some instances, you will have to provide a third-party's Personal Information through the Website (for example, if you request that we ship an order to a third-party).
If you provide us with Personal Information (about you or a third-party), you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the authority to provide that Personal Information and to grant us the right to use that Personal Information consistently with this Privacy Policy, (ii) you have provided that Personal Information voluntarily, and (iii) you consent to the use of that Personal Information in the manner indicated by this Privacy Policy. If you provide a third-party's Personal Information to us, you represent and warrant that such third-party is at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you provide a third-party's email address to us, you represent and warrant that you have the consent of that third-party to provide his/her email address to us.
In addition, we will collect and store certain non-personally identifiable information automatically whenever you interact with the Website. For example, we may collect your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information and reference site domain name when you visit the Website, in order to learn about your browser and operating system.
Like many other websites, we may also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage by using cookies (also called HTTP cookies, web cookies and browser cookies), web beacons (also called pixel tags, Internet tags and clear GIFs), audience management tags and related tracking technologies (collectively, "cookies"). A cookie is a small text file that a website sends through the browser to a user's hard drive or web browser for data storage. The information collected by cookies may include without limitation technical information about your computer (including your computer's IP address, operating system, browser type, and date and time of visit), and the webpages you view, features you use, searches you conduct, queries you make, links you click, purchases you make, and the third-party websites you have visited or visit later. Our use of cookies may enable us to relate your use of this Website to Personal Information that you have provided. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser; however, you should be aware that our Website, like most other sites, may not work properly with "cookies disabled". We therefore recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better experience on this Website.
Some of our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on the Website. By clicking on such URL, you will automatically enter our Website and we may collect information relating to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our email communications.
We may collect aggregate information regarding user behavior to measure interest in and use of our Website and promotions. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable and/or anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by the compiled information. For example, the number of people who visit our Website who are 25 years of age is aggregate information that does not personally identify a specific user. Aggregate information may be used to determine patterns and produce demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.
2. With what categories of third-party persons or entities may we share your personal information?
We will not sell, trade or rent to third parties any Personal Information that you provide to us on or through this Website; provided, however, that Vida may do so in the following circumstances: (i) as part of a merger or sale involving all or substantially all of the assets of Vida, a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change of control; (ii) with your consent; or (iii) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

We and these third parties may place cookies and related technologies on certain pages of our Website to facilitate the collection of your Personal Information and information regarding your use of the Website, which will enable us to serve you ads based on your past visits and online behavior.

4. What steps are taken to keep your personal information secure?
The security of your information is important to us. The Website has technical and security measures in place designed to help protect the Personal Information we collect about you and to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration, access, disclosure and/or destruction of the Personal Information under our control. Our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting all of your Personal Information including credit card number, name and address to prevent individuals from reading this information as it travels over the Internet.
We will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Website. However, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Vida to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, Vida cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.
In order to help protect Personal Information you provide to us, you should (i) not share your password or account information with others, (ii) use a secure web browser, and (iii) change your password frequently. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us.
5. How do you opt-out of receiving promotional communications and/or interest-based advertising?
If you provide us with a wireless number or email address, you agree to receive electronic promotional messages at such number or address from Vida and/or other of our affiliates, unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages.
You may opt-out of receiving such communications in the future by clicking on the opt-out (or unsubscribe) link within any electronic communication you receive from us and otherwise following the instructions in that communication. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us for up to ten business days as we process your request.
With respect to cookies, most browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.
In some, but not all, instances the Website, software services associated with the Website and third parties collecting information through the Website will follow certain Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

Please note that even though you may opt-out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, orders and communications with us. Also, a request to have us stop sharing your Personal Information with other entities for marketing purposes will only apply as of the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such request. In these cases, you will need to contact that entity directly.
