We aim to provide constant and uninterrupted access to the Services, but we do not take responsibility for issues outside our control, such as internet or connection issues. Specifically we do not guarantee:
• the availability of the Services on each and every device or platform all of the time
• that any technical issues that arise can be resolved quickly
• that the Services are error, virus or bug free
3) What do we mean when we refer to “Content” on the Services?
Content can be programmes, video, audio, text, images, either owned by us or licensed to us to use.
4) Whose Content is it?
All copyright, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the Content belong to us or our licensors. The Content is protected by various intellectual property rights, such as copyright and trade mark laws. You may not reproduce or distribute any Content except as provided below.
You may only use the Content for your personal, non-commercial use. However, provided they are credited to STV, you may publish short excerpts or summaries of a published article accompanied by a hyperlink which takes the reader to the whole article on our Services.
Your use of the Content must not (in our sole opinion) bring, or be likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.
Content on our Services may contain statements and opinions which are not our own, and with which we do not necessarily agree. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of all the Content.
5) Accessing our Services
Here are the ways to access our Services.
Visit our web-site at www.stv.tv
Download our Apps (including our STV Player App, and our STV News App)
Subscribe to e-newsletters
Enter a competition
If you join our Services, you will be opening an STV account, and you will be asked to enter your email address and a password ("Log-in details"), along with your name, date of birth and home address. You should keep your Log-in details confidential. Do not allow anyone else to use them. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Log-in details.

You must be 16 or over to join and open an STV account, or to subscribe to any newsletter.
You must provide a current email address and accurate personal details. You must not abuse any functionality of the Services, or other users, nor pass yourself off as another user. STV may require you to provide evidence to verify that your personal details are correct and that you are using our Services in accordance with our Terms of Use.
All information that you provide to us will be held and processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
6) What I should know about using the STV Player?
Age restriction
You must be 16 or over to join and access the STV Player.
Geo-restrictions
We apply "geo-blocking" measures to prevent access to some Content in cases where rights restrictions apply. Specifically, there is some Content which will not be accessible if you are located outside the central and north regions of Scotland (where we broadcast our Channel 3 service), and/or outside the United Kingdom.
You agree not to circumvent any geo-blocking measures or to access, or attempt to access, such Content if you are located in areas to which we have prevented access.
Programme Suitability and Parental Controls
Some of the Content available on the STV Player video on-demand service may contain material unsuitable for under 18s, or may be of a sensitive nature. We use different systems to identify such material.
• Where it is unsuitable for under 16s , we endeavour to identify it by flagging a symbol “G” (for guidance).
• Where is it unsuitable for under 18s (or of a sensitive nature, generally) we provide guidance notes.
We have built parental controls into the STV Player. It’s up to you to set the parental controls if any children have access to your device. Once set, they will prevent the viewing of Content labelled with a “G” symbol from that device unless a 4 figure PIN is entered.
“Catch Up” and archive Content is not live
Catch up and archive Content available on the STV Player is not live. Therefore, please do not respond to any invitation to enter any competition, phone-in, vote, quiz or any other interaction, as the time for the interaction may have come to an end. If you do so, you may still be charged, and your entry/contribution may be too late, and not included, or considered.
Live streaming
When we are live streaming, or simulcasting our television channels over the internet, there is a delay but the service is as near live as possible. Please bear this in mind when interacting with our Services.
Removal/Amendment
Please note that we may amend/remove Content available on our STV Player at any time without notice.
7) How may I use the Services?
You agree to use the Services only for non-commercial, lawful purposes, and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of third parties, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of the Services by any other user.

• use the Services for the transmission of any spam or computer viruses.

• copy, reproduce or otherwise publish any of STV’s trademarks or logos.

You also authorise STV to include some of your personal details together with your Contribution such as your name and location.
For editorial and compliance reasons, we might need to alter your Contribution and you authorise us to do so on the understanding that STV will not alter it in any way that misrepresents it.

• Your Contribution will not infringe or contravene any rights of any third parties (e.g. their entitlement to privacy or confidentiality) or contain anything which is defamatory, obscene, offensive or unlawful.
• You will not transfer files which contain viruses or other technologically harmful material.
If you submit a Contribution via a method which is available to the public, STV recommends that you do not disclose personal contact information such as your address or phone number.

• is the subject of any copyright infringement notice; or
• brings, or is likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.

If you breach any of these Terms of Use, and we choose not to take action against you, that does not necessarily mean that we will waive any subsequent breaches by you. In addition, if we do not exercise the entire remedy available to us, we may still do so at a later date.
11) Links to third party services

Please see our Cookie Policy for further details and how to manage your cookies.
3)WHY WE COLLECT DATA
Data protection and privacy laws permit us to collect and use your personal data on a limited number of grounds. The key grounds upon which we rely are:
• Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and/or those of third parties with whom we share your data as described in this policy, and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (please see below for more info).
• Where we have your consent.
• Where we need it to perform the contract we have with you.
• In order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
The only circumstance in which we rely on consent as our basis for processing your personal data is when you agree to receive email marketing from STV or from the Scottish Children’s Lottery (operated by STV ELM Limited).
In the table below we have set out a summary of our activities which involve the processing of your personal data and our legal bases for doing so.

4)HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE?
The security of your data is important to us. We have technical and operational security measures in place internally within STV, and externally with our authorised suppliers to protect the data we collect, use and store, against unauthorised access or disclosure; improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction or loss.
We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
However, please be aware that the sending of information through the internet is not completely secure. We do not guarantee the security of your data transmitted to and from our Services over the internet, and you accept the inherent security implications of using the internet.
5)SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA
We share your data in the following circumstances:
When we engage data processing companies to act on our behalf from time to time to help manage your data, to provide analysis and to deliver specific functionality. We require those we share it with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and our strict instructions. Please note that some of these companies may be either located and/or have servers which are located outside the European Economic Area (please see below for further detail).
If whilst entering one of our competitions you have expressly agreed that you are happy for us to do so, we will share some of your details with the prize donor or competition sponsor of that competition. Please note that any shared data will then be subject to the privacy policy of any prize donor or competition sponsor.
Where we are required or permitted to do so by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party or our users (which may include steps taken arising from a breach of our Terms of Use).
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer, or new business partner.
When you join STV and also register for the Scottish Children’s Lottery, operated by our group company, STV ELM Limited, we will share the data we hold about you with STV ELM to enable a greater understanding of users, and to provide more relevant advertising and other customised marketing communications across our respective services.
We will only share personal data with STV ELM when you are registered with both STV and the Scottish Children’s Lottery.
If you are not registered with both STV and the Scottish Children’s Lottery, we will only share aggregated, anonymised behavioural information about your use of our services.
A copy of the Scottish Children’s Lottery Privacy Policy is available here.
Where you have given consent to us to do so, we will pass your email address to STV ELM Limited for the Scottish Children’s Lottery to send you marketing communications.
Transfers of Data Out of the EEA
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA to certain authorised suppliers providing functionality or other services to us, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
Please Contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
6)MARKETING
We will only send you marketing emails about STV’s Services where you have given us consent to do so. Some of these communications are issued regularly (as is the case with our e-newsletters), others may be prompted by specific events, or programmes. Please note that these communications may be selected for you on the basis of information you have provided to us, and your use of our Services and may include third party advertising, or third party selected offers (targeted to your interests). Note that we may use your Registration, Technical and/or Analytical Data to form a view on what we think may be of interest to you.
You can unsubscribe at any time from email marketing communications or newsletters. Please go to your Preference Centre where you can manage the communications you receive. You can also unsubscribe via the unsubscribe link at the foot of any email, or contact us at enquiries@stv.tv.
Please note that if you unsubscribe from receiving email marketing from us You will receive service emails from us about your account or to update you on any material changes to our terms and conditions, privacy and cookies policies.
On occasion, when interacting with our Services, such as entering a competition, you may be asked for your permission to share some of your details to a prize donor or sponsor for their marketing purposes. That will be your choice, and at your discretion. To subsequently opt-out of receiving any such communications from a third party, you will need to contact the applicable third party. Please note that we are not responsible for the communications or the content of any communications you receive from any such third party.
Where we hold your address, we may from time to time, on the basis of our legitimate interests, send you marketing communications about STV’s products and services (which may also include third party advertising, or third party selected offers) by post. You can unsubscribe from postal marketing at any time by Contacting Us using the details at Paragraph 11 below.

9)YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to:
• Request access to a copy of the personal data we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request or “SAR””).
• Request correction of any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. Note that you can do most of this by amending your details via your account profile page.
• Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with a legal obligation. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
• Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information.
• Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
• Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
• Make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please Contact Us in the first instance.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please Contact us in writing.
Always keep in mind:

INTRODUCTION TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES ON OUR SERVICES
This Cookie Policy applies to our digital products and services which include our website (www.stv.tv); our STV Player App; our News App and our newsletters (the “Services”), regardless of the platform you use to access them. Whenever you use our Services data may be collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies.
In this policy we explain what cookies are, the types of cookies we use on our Services and what we use them for; that other people may use cookies on our Services; how you can opt out of viewing more relevant ads based on data we collect, including from cookies and how you can manage and control cookies.
If, after reading this policy, you are still struggling with cookies or want additional information on cookies we use on our Services, feel free to contact enquiries@stv.tv.
By using our Services, without changing your web browser settings, we’ll assume you’re happy to the use of cookies and similar technologies as described it in this policy. You can change your web browser settings at any time.
Please note that we update our Cookie Policy from time to time, so please take a fresh read through every so often. If we make significant changes, we will make that clear on our Services, or by some other means of contact such as email.
This Cookie Policy was last updated on 22 May 2018.
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND WHAT ARE THEY USED FOR?
A Cookie is a small amount of data which often contains a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone web browser when you visit a website or application (“App”). If your web browser settings allow it, such cookies are stored on your device’s hard drive and are read by the website or App on each subsequent visit.
When you use our Services, the pages you view (along with a cookie) are downloaded to your device. This enables us to find out whether a device (and probably its user) has used our Services before.
Cookies do many different jobs. They let you move from web page to page efficiently. They allow us to collect data about your experience of our Services which helps us improve the performance of our Services, personalise your experience and make your visits and use of our Services as straightforward, efficient and enjoyable as possible. They can also help to ensure that adverts (ads) you see online are more relevant to your interests.
Some cookies are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so they're there when you come back.
WHAT ARE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND WHEN ARE THEY USED?
Local storage performs very similar functions to cookies. It involves the storage of local files on the hard drive of the device you use to access our STV News App and STV Player App on AppleiOS and Android devices.
Like cookies, local storage can be sessional or perpetual.
Like cookies, local storage does many different jobs. It allows us, for example, to identify you as “signed” in and keeps you in a signed in state each time you use the App; to remember “resume” points in videos you have watched; and to manage parental control functions.
These locally stored files are essential to the operation of our Apps. It is not currently possible to opt out or remove these files from the device without deleting the App(s). For AppleiOS and Android, YouView, Samsung, Freeview, Roku, Now TV, Chromecast devices we send anonymous data to Adobe, our analytical processor, to track usage and for quality purposes.
When we talk about “cookies” in this policy we mean cookies or similar technologies.
WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES ARE USED?
The following types of cookies are used on our Services.
(i) Strictly Necessary cookies enable you to move around www.stv.tv and our Apps and to use their features. They allow us, for example, to;
recognise which users are registered users of our Services;
identify you as signed in to our Services and keep you signed in throughout your visits so that you don’t need to sign in each and every time you visit;
remember security settings, such as parental controls, which restricts access to certain content.
If your device or web browser is not set to receive them, aspects of our Services will not work for you. Disabled parental controls, for example, will not work, nor will our Services be able to recognise you as a registered user, and you may not be able to use the STV Player or view our Live or On Demand content.
(ii) Functional cookies allow us to remember choices you made previously, when using our Services, as well as details, like your user name. That helps personalise your use of our Services and make it more efficient and enjoyable. Examples of the things functional cookies do include;
allowing you access to your stored information if you have joined STV;
remembering your settings on your visits to our Services;
enabling us to serve the appropriate regionalised service relevant to your location;
remembering your place in a video if you leave the "On Demand" section of our Services at STV Player before you've finished watching a programme, so that you can pick up where you left off the next time; and
limiting the number of times that some ads which you may view on our Services are shown to you within a short space of time. This is sometimes called “frequency capping”.
(iii) Analytical cookies are used in analytical services provided by other organisations on our behalf to help us to profile people who use our Services and to better understand how they use them.
Analytical services allow us to;
* recognise your web browser or device if you have used our Services before;
* count the number of visitors to our Services;
* analyse patterns of behaviour among our users- see what parts of our Services are most popular;
* test different versions of a page or feature and how information is presented to you to see which one works best;
* identify what programmes and ads have been watched online;
which, in turn, allows us to:
* provide you with recommendations- for example, if we see that people who watched a programme you are watching also watched another programme, we might recommend that other programme to you;
* deliver more relevant ads to you; and
* improve our Services and deliver a better user experience.
Combining Data from analytical cookies with other data
If you provide personal data to us, such as your name, address, email address or date of birth, when using our Services, we may combine that with data we get from our analytical services and from data we collect from Experian to analyse how our Services are used. Where combined data can be used to identify you, we use it only in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
We may use that data to (i) send you newsletters that might be of interest to you where you have opted in to receive such communications and (ii) deliver to you ads across our Services (including in our newsletters) that are more relevant to your interests. You may opt out of (or back in to) receiving more relevant ads from us based on Combined Data at your Preference Centre. Please note that receiving more relevant ads from us on the basis of Combined Data is not OBA. WE describe OBA and how you can opt out of it in the (iv) Advertising cookies section below.
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board
We are currently participating in a research project carried out by the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB) to gather anonymised statistics about the usage of media players. The aim is to understand the number of users and the extent of use of these players and the content within them. Several other major broadcasters are also participating in the project. BARB has chosen Kantar Media to collect this data through the use of cookies that are placed on your device when you use STV Player. All data is collected anonymously and will not be used by us for any other purpose but for this project.
(iv) Advertising cookies are set by our advertising partners. Some have functional purposes such as capping the number of times you see an ad, but most enable Online Behavioural Advertising “OBA” (also known as ‘behavioural targeting' or ‘interest based advertising') which delivers ads to you that are more relevant to your interests.
(a) OBA cookies remember a user’s web browsing activity. Shared interests, based upon, and inferred from, the websites you have visited, are grouped together. Ads you view will be determined by these interests. For example, if you visit a sports’ section of a website and searched other websites for sport, that interest – together with the shared interests of other web users - might be grouped together as ‘sport loving” and you may be served ads for sport and sports’ related goods or services.
(b) Personalised retargeting is a form of OBA that enables our advertising partners to show you ads based on your online browsing away from our Services. Therefore, when you use our Services, you may see ads for products or services from websites you have visited away from our Services. These cookies will usually be set by advertising partners that are working with many advertisers and ad agencies. Our main advertising partners are detailed in the Managing Advertising Cookies section below.
Without these cookies, online ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.
(v) Other organisations’ cookies may be set on pages of our Services where we include embedded content from other organisations like Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. We cannot access or control these cookies. You should check the relevant organisation’s website for information about them.
DIFFERENT WAYS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL YOUR COOKIES
There are various ways that you can manage and control your cookies and we outline them below.
MANAGING COOKIES IN YOUR WEB BROWSER

The “Competition Period” is the period between the opening date and time and the closing date and time for the receipt of entries by STV.
All Competition entries and/or votes must be received by STV within the Competition Period. Any entries and/or votes submitted outside the Competition Period will be automatically disqualified. Where no opening date and time is specified in the Competition Promotion, the Competition opening date is the date the Competition Promotion is published.

(iii) photocopies and not originals; or incomplete.
STV reserves the right to disqualify any entrant and/or vote when it considers at its discretion, acting reasonably, that any entrant has used improper technical means to submit any Competition entries.
If STV believes, acting reasonably, that any Competition entrant is not an eligible entrant in accordance with these Competition Terms, or has otherwise breached these Competition Terms, STV is entitled to disqualify that entrant and/or exclude that entrant from participating in the Competition. By entering a Competition, you confirm to STV that all information submitted by you is true, current and complete.
F. Prizes
Prize descriptions are as specified in the Competition Promotion.
Where a Prize contains multiple components, the Prize must be accepted in its entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, the Prize cannot be separated.
The prize is subject to availability, there is no cash alternative and STV reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to substitute the prize with a prize of equivalent or greater value.
Where a prize is supplied by a third party, STV reserves the right to replace the prize with an alternative prize of equal or higher value if circumstances beyond STV’s control makes it necessary to do so.
The prize is not negotiable or transferable.
You are solely responsible for any expenses not specified in the prize description and STV does not accept any responsibility for any such expenses.
Unless otherwise stated in the Competition Promotion, prizes involving travel shall be restricted and will be the responsibility of the winner as follows:
(i) You will be responsible for travel to and from the prize destination and for any costs incurred. This shall not form part of the prize;
(ii) You will be responsible for ensuring that you, and any person travelling with you, are available to travel and hold valid passports (where necessary), any necessary visas and travel documents for the holiday in question on the travel dates specified.
(iii) You will be responsible for all travel insurance, holiday insurance and health insurance required or desired by you in order to use the prize.
Where travel dates are restricted or specified, the prize is only available for travel within the restricted and/or specified dates, and where travel dates are not so restricted or specified, all travel and holiday prizes must be taken within one year of the date of the winner being selected. Dates, once notified to travel agent, cannot be changed.
Prizes are awarded at STV’s discretion and no prizes will be awarded in the event of improper actions by or on behalf of any entrant.
Where a Competition prize is provided by a third party (“Prize Donor”), you may be required to complete additional formalities with the Prize Donor, including, by way of example, completing booking forms or signing up to and abiding by the Prize Donor’s reasonable terms and conditions. STV shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions of the Prize Donor or any other third party.
Not all Competition prizes are suitable for everyone. For example, some prizes may consist of items to be used for physical exercise or leisure activities. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are suited to use any Competition prize as it is intended to be used and to ensure that you understand how any such items work and their intended purpose and mode of operation. If you are, at any time, unsure as to your suitability to use any Competition prize that involves physical activity, you should consult your own doctor.
By entering any Competition, you agree to provide any additional personal information to STV, including your name, telephone number and address which is necessary for the purposes of contacting you to deliver the prize or for validating your identity and eligibility.
G. Winners
In the event that a Competition winner is to be selected at random from all eligible correct entries for the Competition, that winner will be selected by either:
(i) an automated computer process that undertakes verifiably random selection; or
(ii) an individual who is independent of and not involved in the Competition or its administration.
In the event that a Competition winner is selected as a result of a subjective evaluation of eligible Competition entries - for example, a photographic Competition, – the criteria for judging will be set out in the Rules. Unless otherwise stated, selection shall be undertaken by or under the supervision of either:
(i) an independent judge who is independent of and not involved in the competition or its administration; or
(ii) a panel of judges that includes at least one independent judge on the panel.
Where the names of the judges are not published on STV’s website at www.stv.tv for a period of 14 days after the Competition Closing Date, the names will be sent to anyone who writes to STV, within 28 days after the Closing Date of the Competition, requesting details of the judges and who encloses a self-addressed envelope to the address set out in Clause N(2).
Where entries are judged on creative or artistic merit or other subjective criteria, STV and/or the Competition judges (acting reasonably) reserve the right not to select a winner, and/or remove or amend selection criteria and/or the structure and operation of the Competition if entries are not of the requisite standard.
Where the winner is to be selected by STV consumers, unless otherwise stated in the Competition Promotion, the winner will be the contestant with the highest number of eligible votes.
In the event of a tie-breaker, the Winner will be selected by an independent judge whose decision will be final.
In the event that any Competition winner, after being selected as the winner, is subsequently disqualified from a Competition for any reason, STV shall, in its sole discretion, decide whether a replacement winner should be selected in accordance with the Competition criteria.
STV shall endeavour to contact Competition winner personally as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, using the telephone number or email address provided with the competition entry.
If any Competition winner cannot be traced or contacted after reasonable efforts have been made by STV or, having been contacted, the prize winner declines the prize in whole or in part, then STV reserves the right to offer the prize to the next eligible entrant selected from the correct entries that were received before the Closing Date, or may cancel the Competition and dispose of the prize in its discretion without any liability to that Competition winner.
STV does not accept any responsibility if the winner is unable to take up the prize. In such circumstances, STV may, at its sole discretion, choose an alternative winner, selected from the eligible correct entries submitted for that Competition
By entering a Competition, the winner agrees to provide their first and last name and county (or region) of residence for publication by STV or release on request.
STV may publish the winner’s name and city of residence on its website at http://www.stv.tv/. Where the winner’s name and city is not published, it will be released on request. Any such request must be made in writing, within one month of the Competition Period, and the writer must enclose a self-addressed envelope to the address set out in Clause N(2).
By entering a Competition the winner agrees to participate in any reasonable publicity and promotional activity required by STV and further agrees that STV’s may use your name and county (or region) or residence, image, audio and/or visual recordings of them in any publicity or promotional activity.
The decision of STV or the judges nominated by STV relating to the winner selection is final and no correspondence or discussion will be entered into.
H. Claiming the prize
Unless stated otherwise, the winner must claim the prize within 14 days. If the prize is not claimed or accepted within that period, the claim will become invalid.
The prize may not be claimed by a third party on the winner’s behalf. Unless otherwise agreed, the winner should allow 28 days for delivery of the prize.
The winner must inspect the prize on receipt and contact STV within 14 days from the date it is received and report any concerns about the quality or performance of the same to STV. Thereafter, the winner is deemed to have accepted the prize as delivered. Any rejected prize must be returned within 28 days, or such other reasonable period as STV may require.
I. Liability
Nothing in these Competition Terms is intended to, or shall be deemed to, restrict your statutory rights as a consumer.
Insofar as permitted by law and subject to paragraph I(1) above, STV, its agents or distributors will not in any circumstances be responsible or liable to compensate you or accept any liability for any loss, damage, personal injury or death occurring as a result of participating in a Competition or accepting any prize except where it is caused by the negligence of STV, its agents or distributors or that of its employees. Your statutory rights are not affected.
STV does not promise that the online or internet services in relation to a Competition will be free from errors or omissions nor that they will be available uninterrupted and in a fully operating condition. The services may be suspended temporarily and without notice in the case of any technical issues in relation to any telecommunications or internet network, problem with any system, server, or software, or as a result of any technical malfunction, failure or repair.
You agree to indemnify STV in respect of any losses suffered by STV resulting from any claim by a third party or any fine imposed upon STV in respect of any matter, arising from your use of our Services and entry into or participation in any Competition in breach of these Competition Terms, any Rules and/or our Terms of Use or from your violation of any applicable law or regulation.
J. Privacy
When you enter and/or participate in a Competition, any personal information you provide will be processed in accordance with the STV Privacy Policy. Any competition information you provide to STV, in addition to your account information, will be stored for a period of two (2) years.
Please note that in the event that you elect to receive marketing communications from a named Prize Donor, the use of your information by such third party will be subject to the terms of the Prize Donor’s privacy policy.

Comments and STV House Rules
We want your views but we also want to make this a place where people feel they can contribute without being shouted down. So we have a few simple House Rules which we ask you to respect. We reserve the right to take down or edit anything that we consider breaks these rules. These apply to any kind of contribution you make, not just to words but to pictures and videos as well.
Stay on the topic at hand.
Don't post anonymously.
Respect others; disagree as strongly as you like with someone but don’t spoil your argument by attacking or insulting them personally. That also means no hate speech, profanities or what we perceive as discrimination against groups or individuals.
Solid facts always back up an argument; so be as accurate as you can. Better still, leave a link to where you got the information.
Don’t include personal information (such as addresses or phone numbers), yours or anybody else’s.
Keep it legal – that means not defamatory, in breach of copyright, in contempt of court or in breach of privacy laws (see 5, above). Remember you are responsible for what you say.
No spam, advertising, spurious links or anything misleading.
We (that is, STV) welcome your views on our own products and services but we will delete material that is incorrect or just plain abusive.
If you see anything on our Services that you feel should not be there, please click on the word "Flag" on the Comment to alert us to it. You can also contact enquiries@stv.tv or phone us on 0141 300 3704. We will deal with it as quickly as we possibly can.
