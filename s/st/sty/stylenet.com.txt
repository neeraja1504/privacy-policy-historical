We collect only information necessary in order to satisfactorily process and complete customer transactions. Customer payment transactions are processed through a highly secure server. All customer information is nonpublic and will NEVER be shared or forwarded in any way to anyone not involved strictly in the process of completing our customers’ transaction.
High-Grade Encryption by Authorize.Net and PayPal is used to protect your credit card and banking information during checkout. NOTE: Your browsers padlock will be in the locked position on our checkout page that requests your credit card numbers. Preceding order checkout pages will show the padlock in the open position.

COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE
We communicate with users on a need-be basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their orders, confirmations or inquiries. We reply via administrative email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. StyleNet does not send out any secondary communications online or via postal mail from the personal information provided by users who make purchases on users’ web sites.
SECURITY
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just “surfing”.
DOMAIN NAME OWNERSHIP
Domain Names (a/k/a URL’s) registered on behalf of active StyleNet clients are legally owned by Stylenet. Domain names may also be transferred to Stylenet for convenience of managing DNS setting and email accounts. In the event that a client wishes to manage their own domain through a domain registrar of their choice, Stylenet will provide the required DNS information in order to activate the website, thus holding the client liable for renewing the domain registration, managing email accounts associated with the domain name, and any downtime of their website due to domain related complications. In the event a client wishes to terminate their StyleNet subscription, upon request, StyleNet will release control of the Domain Name to the client.
