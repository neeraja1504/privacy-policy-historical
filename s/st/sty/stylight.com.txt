Summary - Data protection
Personal data protection is a matter of trust and your trust is highly important to us. It is our interest to respect your privacy and your right to deal with the information about you. In the following, we would like to inform you about our data collection and our use of the data so that you feel safe when using our online offer. The legal rules about dealing with personal data are strictly followed by us.

Exceptions will be explained in this privacy notice.
1. Collection and Processing of Personal Data
1.1. General
All information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., name, address, phone number, date of birth or email address) is personal data.
In general, you are able to use our online offer without providing personal data. The usage of certain services may, however, require you to provide personal data, e.g., registration or the participation in a raffle. Mandatory fields are generally denoted accordingly.
1.2. Purposes of Processing and Legal Basis for the Processing
We process your personal data for the following purposes, based on the Legal Bases listed:
Providing this online offer and performance of contract following our Terms of Use (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
Personalization of the offer (Legal basis: Performance of a contract)
Dispatch of a newsletter with the recipient´s consent via email. (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
Performance of raffles under respective raffle terms. (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
House and third party advertising to the legally allowed extent or based on consent. (Legal basis: legitimate interests; there is a legitimate interest in direkt marketing as long as marketing occurs while complying with data protection and fair trade laws).
In case you wish to use services which first require the formation of a contract, we will ask you to register. Within the scope of registering, we collect personal data necessary for the formation and performance of the contract (especially e-mail address). Further data can be entered on a voluntary basis.
Prevention and protection against misuse (especially bot detection).
2. Data Transfer to Third Parties, Service Providers
2.1. Data Transfer to Third Parties
Your personal data is generally only being transferred to third parties as far as this is necessary for performance of the contract, if we or the third party have legitimate interests in transferring or if you have consented to this. If data is transferred to third parties based on legitimate interests, this will be explained in this privacy notice. Beyond or in addition to this, data may be transferred to third parties as far as we are obligated to do so under statutory provisions or an enforceable decision made by an authority or a court.
2.2. Data Transfer to Service Providers
We reserve the right to use service providers in collecting or processing data. Service providers are only given personal data that is necessary for their concrete task. This means that your email address may be forwarded to a service provider so you can receive a newsletter that you ordered. Service providers may also be assigned to provide server capacity. Service providers are generally involved as so-called processors which may only process users' personal data based on our instructions.
2.3. Data Transfer to Non-EEA Countries
We also forward personal data to third parties or processors who are located outside EEA countries. In such cases we ensure prior to the transfer that the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (e.g., by self-certification of the recipient for the EU US Privacy Shield or by having agreed upon so-called standard data protection clauses of the European Union with the recipient) or sufficient user consent is given. You may receive an overview of third country recipients and a copy of the appropriate or suitable safeguards in place. Please use the details provided in the Contact section.
3. Duration of Storage; Retention Periods
We store your data as long as it is necessary to provide our online offer and the services connected with it or as long as we have a legitimate interest in continued storage. In all other cases, we delete your personal data with the exception of such data that we are required to retain for the purpose of contractual or statutory (e.g., taxation or commercial law) retention periods (e.g., invoices). At this point, contractual retention periods may also result from contracts with third parties (e.g., those holding copyrights or IP rights). Data that is only retained because it is subject to a retention period is restricted from processing until the period expires and will then be deleted.
4. Log Files
Every time you use the internet, your internet browser or terminal device automatically transmits certain information which is then saved by us in log files.
We save log files for the purposes of determining disruptions, for security reasons (e.g., to elucidate attack attempts) and for the bot detection for a period of 7 to 30 days and delete them thereafter. Log files which need to remain stored for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally resolved and may be forwarded to investigating authorities on a case-by-case basis.
Log files contain especially following information:
IP address (internet protocol address) of the terminal device which is used to access the online offer;
Internet address of the website from which the online offer is accessed (so-called URL of origin or referrer URL);
Name of the service provider through which access to the online offer occurs;

Log files are moreover used for app analysis.

The providers of the tools (vendors) process data only as processors subject to our directives and not for their own purposes.

Be advised that with regard to tools that use opt out cookies, the opt out function is related to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time.

Regarding the processing of data in connection with the tools, the providers serve as controllers as long as we have not stated otherwise. The tools’ providers forward information, for the purposes mentioned before, to third parties, if necessary.
The tools either do not process user IP addresses at all or shorten them immediately upon collection.

9.5. Social Plugins with 2-Click-Solution
The different providers of plugins are in the following summarized as “Plugin Providers”.
To increase the protection of your data when visiting our online offer, plugins are embedded using the so-called "Shariff Solution". This means that when a page of this online offer is accessed, a connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider is not yet established.
Your internet browser establishes a direct connection to the respective plugin provider’s servers only when you activate the plugins. This way, the plugin provider receives information that your internet browser has accessed the respective site of our online offer, even when you do not maintain a user account with the provider or are not logged in. Log files (including the IP address) are transmitted directly from your internet browser to a server of the respective plugin provider and may be stored there. This server may be located outside the EU or EEA (e.g. in the U.S.).
The plugins are stand alone extensions of the plugin providers. We, thus, do not have influence on the scope of data gathered and stored by the plugin provider through the plugin.
If you do not wish for the plugin providers to receive, save, and use data gathered through this online offer, you should not use the respective plugins.
You can also block the plugins from being loaded with browser add ons (so-called script blockers).
Find out more about the purpose and scope of the data collection as well as about processing and use of your data by plugin providers and about your rights and possibilities to change settings to protect your data in the privacy statements of the respective providers.

Objection to data processing ensuing from the legal basis “justified interest”:
