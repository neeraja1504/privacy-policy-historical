Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US ("Google") and can be used to create, update and manage tags.
Tags are snippets of code on our website, which are used i.a. to measure traffic and visitor behaviour and to detect the impact of online advertising and social channels.
When you visit our website, the current tag configuration is sent to the end-user's browser with instructions for which tags should fire. The tool itself does not collect any personally identifiable information. The tool instructs other tags to fire, and these other tags may collect data. For more information on how Google Tag Manager works please visit: https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772432?hl=en&topic=2574304&ctx=topic and the use policy: https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/.
