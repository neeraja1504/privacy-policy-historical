Privacy Policy
STINGRAY PRIVACY POLICY
Stingray Group Inc., together with its affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities (collectively “Stingray”) are committed to protecting your privacy. Stingray's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Stingray collects, holds, uses and divulges the Information (as defined below) when you use its websites, web players, applications, widgets, products and/or services (collectively, the “Stingray Services”). By using the Stingray Services or by signing up to receive Stingray's newsletters, electronic messages, news, updates, contests, special offers and/or other written communications (the “Stingray Messages”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
In this Privacy Policy, “you” refers to the person using the Stingray Services if this person is 13 years old or over, or to a parent or legal guardian if the user is under the age of 13.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES STINGRAY COLLECT, HOLD, USE AND DIVULGE?
Depending on your use of the Stingray Services, Stingray may collect, hold, use and divulge the information that you knowingly choose to disclose and enter on any of the Stingray Services or that you otherwise give to Stingray and that can be used to identify you, such as your name, contact information, your e-mail address, location, information about your postal address, social media accounts and information about your age, your demographic information, mobile and/or computer device (collectively, the “Information”).
You can choose not to provide certain Information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of the Stingray Services. You may contact Stingray as set forth in the Section "Contact Stingray about Privacy" to address any issue thereof.
Stingray also gathers and may allow third parties to collect Information, including Information which is generated by your devices or computers when you interact with the Stingray Services, including location information and IP address. See Sections "Use of Cookies and Authentication Tokens" and "Online Behavioral Advertising" for more information on this topic.
WHY DOES STINGRAY COLLECT AND HOLD YOUR INFORMATION?
Stingray generally collects and holds your Information to:
Process payment for the Stingray Services that you purchase from Stingray, when applicable;
Communicate with you concerning your account and provide timely customer service when needed;
Track your location for the purpose of identifying the Stingray Services that are currently available to you;
Provide you with the Stingray Services, respond to and perform your requests for the Stingray Services, including to deliver the Stingray Services you have purchased;
Offer you product upgrades, and other Stingray Services;
Authenticate the users of the Stingray Services;
Provide you with targeted advertising while using the Stingray Services or third party services;
If you have consented to receive such information, provide you with the Stingray Messages and/or those of its partners and licensors;
Share your Content (as defined below) with other users of the applicable Stingray Services or third party services and platforms as detailed below;
Recommend you content based on your use of the Stingray Services (collectively, the “Purposes”).
The legal basis for using the Information for the Purposes is typically a contractual basis (i.e. to provide you with the Stingray Services) or because you have consented to such Purposes. However, Stingray may also rely on other legal grounds, for example, where the processing is necessary for its legitimate interests or for compliance with legal obligations to which it is subject.
Stingray's software may include the opportunity to disable certain software features to increase your level of privacy. However, certain technical information (e.g., zip code) may be automatically transmitted between networked servers to authenticate access to the Stingray Services, enable their delivery, or optimize your media delivery experience.
Stingray does not rent or sell any of your Information to third parties and will not share it with third parties without your consent, unless it is necessary to do so by law or for the purposes of or as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
WHEN AND HOW DOES STINGRAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
Stingray may disclose your Information to its partners and licensors to the extent such disclosure is required for the Purposes. Stingray may use third parties to facilitate its business, such as payment processors, hosting services providers, contractors for sending out e-mail updates about Stingray and the Stingray Services or for providing customer support services. In connection with these business operations, Stingray's contractors and service providers may have access to your Information collected by Stingray for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where Stingray utilizes third parties for the processing of any Information, Stingray implements reasonable contractual and technical protections in order for such third parties to keep all Information they process strictly confidential. Please note that these third parties may be located in other countries where the laws on processing personal information can differ from the laws of your country of residence.
Stingray may also disclose your Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law; (b) comply with the order of a competent judicial authority in any jurisdiction; (c) comply with legal process served on Stingray; (d) protect and defend the rights or property of Stingray; (e) enforce or verify your compliance with any part of the agreements that you enter into with Stingray, if any; (f) prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Stingray Services; or (g) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Stingray Services or the public at large.
