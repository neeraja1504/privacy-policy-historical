Privacy policy — Study in Holland
We are aware that you have placed your trust in us. Therefore, we handle your personal data with the utmost care. How exactly do we do that?
You register with a network, sign up for a training or subscribe to a newsletter. When you use one of our services, we ask you for your personal details, so that we can provide you with good service. These could be your name, address, email address and telephone number.
Use
We will use your personal data exclusively for the purpose for which you have provided it. If you entered your name and email address to subscribe to a newsletter, for example, we will not use the data to send you other information. Unless expressly stated otherwise, we will not pass on your personal data to third parties. Your data may be used by the authorities, if legally required.
If you ask us a question we may need to involve another organisation to answer this question. The data that we exchange with this organisation will only be used by them to answer your question.
When you subscribe to a newsletter, you can indicate a preference for certain topics. You will then only get to see news about those topics. We will save your preferences for as long as you are subscribed to the newsletter.

If you are under 16 years of age your parents or guardians need to give us permission to process your personal data.
