Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and saved by the browser. Most of the cookies the platform uses are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after a user’s visit. Other cookies remain in the device's memory until users delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize the user’s browser when the user next visits the site.
A similar technology is used for the Studydrive app, so called Cell-IDs. These allow Studydrive to identify the user’s mobile device, for example when a user opens the app again after the first use. One example: In the Firebase (see above) SDK-library an App Instance ID is used to identify app installations. In general, within the Firebase SDK, IDs of mobile device are identified by a technology that is similar to cookies.
Users can configure their browser to inform them about the use of cookies so that they can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, the user’s browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions users wish to use are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
