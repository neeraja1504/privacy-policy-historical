Study Stack - Privacy
The following statement outlines StudyStack's policies and principles regarding online privacy. StudyStack is committed to protecting the privacy of its users.
StudyStack reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time without notice. As such, and since we want to always make certain that our privacy policy is clearly understood, we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically to note any changes that may have occurred. Please forward any comments you may have regarding this policy to us at privacy@studystack.com.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
When a user signs up to join StudyStack, StudyStack will store the e-mail address entered into our database of users. StudyStack will not sell your email address to any other company. However, by providing your email address, StudyStack will be able to contact you if necessary with information about the StudyStack web site. Your email address is primarily used for resetting your password if you ever forget it.
The only time StudyStack requests a name to be entered is if a user upgrades to StudyStack's PRO plan. This Upgrade page is not accessible to accounts that registerd as being 12 or younger. The information entered while subscribing to the PRO plan is not sent to studystack's servers but is transmitted to stripe.com for payment processing.
StudyStack reserves the right to collect information regarding who entered what data. This allows StudyStack to notify the individual who entered a certain piece of information if it suspects that the information is incorrect. If a copyright holder claims that information you entered infringes on their copyright, StudyStack may share your email address with them.

Advertisements
To allow StudyStack to remain a free website, StudyStack displays advertisements on its pages. Alternatively, you may upgrade to our PRO plan that does not display ads. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Many of the ads displayed are from Google's AdSense advertising network. These ads may allow Google to know that you have visited the StudyStack web site. This information helps Google to display "interest-based" ads that should interest you more. If you prefer not to participate in interest-based advertising, you may opt out of this program at google.com.
Clicking on advertisements will redirect you to the web page of the advertiser. The StudyStack privacy statement does not apply to the advertiser's website.
