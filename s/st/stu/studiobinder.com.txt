Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control
You may be aware that a European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have become more transparent about those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:
Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
Right to Erasure - the right to request that we remove your personal data;
Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
Right to Object -
the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.
StudioBinder puts you in control of how we process your personal data. If we send you electronic marketing messages based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may, at any time, respectively withdraw such consent or declare your objection (“opt-out”) at no cost. The electronic marketing messages you receive from StudioBinder (e.g. those sent via email) also will include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself (e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you).
You can find out more about the GDPR rights described above and the controls we provide here. If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact us at any time. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity.

We use anonymized and aggregated information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, creating marketing and promotion models, improving the StudioBinder, and developing new features and functionality for StudioBinder Features.
Types of Information We Collect
Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access the StudioBinder Features generally. However, you may be required to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the StudioBinder Features. We may collect non-personal information such as your browser type, when you accessed the StudioBinder Features and from what physical location you accessed the StudioBinder Features. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of the StudioBinder Features. We also may use this data to monitor the StudioBinder Features’ performance and to make the StudioBinder Features easier and more convenient to use.
We collect personal information when you create an account through the StudioBinder Features; participate in registration forms, order forms, feedback forms or surveys; purchase a product through the StudioBinder Features; participate in forums, news groups, or bulletin boards on the Site; use third-party applications such as Intercom or Google Analytics; or receive customer or technical support.
To create an account for the StudioBinder Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including your name, company name, email address, and password. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account, including your profile picture, phone number, or company address is optional, but enables you to gain more from the StudioBinder Features.
When purchasing a premium plan or subscription through the StudioBinder Features, you will also be required to provide a credit card number, billing address, phone number or other payment information. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.

Third Party Privacy Policies
Through the StudioBinder Features, you may be able to link to technology, software and services owned and controlled by third parties (“ ** Third Party Features** ”). You may be permitted or required to submit personal information to access Third Party Features. Such use of Third Party Features and submission of information through Third Party Features will be subject to such applicable third party’s terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy. You agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to StudioBinder to enforce your rights in relation thereto. When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on the Site, or accessible through the StudioBinder Features, which links you to any Third Party Features, our Terms of Use no longer applies and you must read the terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.
How We Use Your Personal Information
The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide the StudioBinder Features to you, depending on the StudioBinder Features for which you register. This includes alerting you of new products or services, features, or enhancements to the StudioBinder Features; verifying your identity; handling your customer service questions or issues; processing orders; requesting feedback; distributing newsletters; and notifying you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.

We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the StudioBinder Features (the “ ** Analytical Data** ”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any StudioBinder Features users.
