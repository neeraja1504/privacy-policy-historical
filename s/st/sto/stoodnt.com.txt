IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS
Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Stoodnt app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Stoodnt app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES
We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:
If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Stoodnt account with a email provider (e.g., Google) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as Stoodnt for Business, we may receive information about you from your employer.
If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a College Counselor or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User.
