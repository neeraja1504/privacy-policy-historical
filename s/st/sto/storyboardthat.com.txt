Storyboard That Privacy Policy | Clever Prototypes
Introduction
This privacy policy (“Policy”) is designed to inform users of the Storyboard That service, including all associated websites (collectively, the “Service”) about how Clever Prototypes, LLC (“Clever Prototypes,” “we” or “us”) gathers and uses personal information collected by us in connection with the Service. We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using or otherwise benefiting from the Service or otherwise submitting personal information to Clever Prototypes via the Service. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
What Information Do We Collect?
Limited Personal Information:
We collect the following personal information in connection with the Service: (a) if you register as a Clever Prototypes user directly, we will collect the personal information you submit to us to build your user profile, including your name, email address, and zip code; (b) if you pay fees by credit card, we may collect the name, expiration date and credit card number for the relevant card; and (c) if you communicate with us by email, we will collect your email address. All of this information is referred to in this Policy as “Personal Information”.

Without limitation, you shall not submit to Clever Prototypes any social security number, financial account number, credit or debit card number (other than the number of the card paying for the Service), driver’s license number or government ID number.
When parents or guardians (or schools and/or teachers acting in an educational context) create accounts for students under 13 years of age, we may collect personally identifiable information – including first name, last name, and email address – regarding the students on whose behalf such accounts are created for the sole purpose of rendering the Service. Students under 13 years of age who use the Service under the supervision of a parent or guardian (or school and/or teacher acting in the educational context) are permitted to provide or upload any personally identifiable information.
We will use commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect all such personally identifiable information.
User Data:
The Service allows all users to create storyboards using data provided by Clever Prototypes and, optionally, data provided by users. All data uploaded by users is referred to in this Policy as “User Data.”
Web Tracking Information:
We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Service efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Service. Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications, and Clever Prototypes’ Contractors (as defined herein) may also do so. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information, except for internal operational, product development, and administrative purposes of the Service. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.

Users should be aware of this when they leave our Service and review the privacy statements of each third party website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Service.
Amendments:
Clever Prototypes may modify or amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, as determined by Clever Prototypes, in the way in which Personal Information is collected, used or transferred, we will notify you of these changes by modification of this Privacy Policy, which will be available for review by you at the Service.

Geographic Location
We offer the service in several geographic regions. We define a geographic region as the location where a user is located.
Users Within the United States
For users within the United States, we process data in data centers located in the United States. We have adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our possession. We comply with state and federal laws governing the protection of personal information.
Users Within the European Union
For users within the European Union, we transfer data from the European Union to data centers located in the United States for processing. Such processing is performed in accordance with Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
