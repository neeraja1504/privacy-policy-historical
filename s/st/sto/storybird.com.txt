In addition to information that you provide, we collect, and we use third party services to assist us in collecting and understanding, Program and Site usage information. For example:

3. Children Under 13
In the event that the Site or Service is used by individuals under the age of 13, Storybird will comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior consent of their parent or legal guardian. In order to become a Member, a child under 13 must provide a nickname, password and parent email address. We use that parent email address to request consent from the parent or legal guardian before allowing the child to register, in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). If we do not receive consent or if we do not receive a response, we delete the child’s and parent’s information. When a child under 13 registers for a classroom account, we rely on the school to provide consent on behalf of the parents or legal guardians, in accordance with our Terms of Use.
We collect only the minimally required personal information from children under 13, and do not condition participation by them in any Storybird feature with a request for personal information.
Parents of Students may view work created in their child’s Student account via a class code. Parents of Regular Members under 13 may receive notifications about new work their child has created, view comments on their child’s stories, and view followers and re-posts via the parent email that is associated with their child’s account.
Our systems employ filters for Stories and Comments that are intended to prevent the communication of both personal information and age-inappropriate words and phrases. In addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag inappropriate communications. No filtering system can be perfect, so we encourage all Members to never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation.
In the case of Regular Members, parents or legal guardians of a minor child may also review or request that we delete their child’s personal information, ask us to deactivate their child’s account, or revoke any consents they have provided for their child by contacting us. Note that we may take reasonable steps to verify your identify and your relationship to the child before completing your request.
