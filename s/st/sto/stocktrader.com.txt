PRIVACY POLICY - StockTrader.com
This Privacy Policy controls and governs your use and access to any and all of Reink Media Group, LLC’s websites: investor.com, StockBrokers.com, ForexBrokers.com, StockTrader.com, and InvestingTeacher.com (collectively the “Website”). Depending on your residency or other legal factors, you may be subject to additional, or different, terms and conditions. Please see below for further information. Please note that, to the extent additional, or different, terms and conditions apply, the Privacy Policy is hereby expressly modified to incorporate the same.
WEBSITE VISITORS
Like most website operators, Reink Media collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Reink Media’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how its visitors use the Website. From time to time, Reink Media may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
Reink Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Reink Media does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with the Website in ways that require Reink Media to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Reink Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Reink Media collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Website. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities.
AGGREGATED STATISTICS
Reink Media may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website. For instance, Reink Media may reveal how many views a particular streaming video broadcast had.
PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
Reink Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (a) need to know that information in order to process it on Reink Media’s behalf or to provide services available on the Website, and (b) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Reink Media will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Reink Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Reink Media believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Reink Media, third-parties, or the public at large.
If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, Reink Media may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Reink Media, the Website and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. You have the right to opt out of receiving these type of email communications and need only notify us of your request to no longer receive such emails. With respect to other requests you may send to us (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Reink Media takes all measures reasonably calculated to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
