Statement
GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and replaces the previous Data Protection Directives that were in place.  It was approved by the EU Parliament in 2016 and comes into effect on 25th May 2018. GDPR states that personal data should be ‘processed fairly & lawfully’ and ‘collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes’ and that individuals data is not processed without their knowledge and are only processed with their ‘explicit’ consent. GDPR covers personal data relating to individuals.
Stock Channel Ltd is committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals with respect to the processing of personal data.  GDPR gives individuals the right to know what information is held about them.  It provides a framework to ensure that personal information is handled properly.
Stock Channel Ltd –  May 21st 2018 Registered in England, number 07083121, Registered office: 1-6 Yarmouth Place, London, Greater London, W1J 7BU
Personal Data We Collect
By necessity, Stock Channel Ltd needs to store some personal information.  There are two sets of data held; User Access Data and End Customer Data.
User Access Data
Every person who wishes to use Stock Channel Ltd needs to register and login.  During the registration process, we collect the following personal data;
– Title
– First Name
– Last Name
– Telephone Number
– Email Address
– Business Name and Address
– Job Title
This data is collected in order to validate that the registered user is a legitimate trade professional, and to be able to identify who the person using the site is.  We store the data permanently.  The reason for doing so is so that users are able to log on and access the service easily.  The names and other details of the site’s users are not passed on to any third party.
End Customer Data
Stock Channel Ltd provides services to Client businesses who may sell, via Stock Channel Ltd, products to individuals.  In order to be able to sell and deliver a product to that End Customer, it is necessary for Stock Channel Ltd to collect the following personal data;
– Title
– First Name
– Last Name
– Personal Email Address
– Telephone
– Number
– Physical Address
This data is collected in order to be able to ensure that the individual be kept informed of the progress of his order, and to have their purchases physically delivered.  We store the data permanently.  The reason for doing so is to have a record of the orders and who made them.  This data will potentially be passed to wholesale suppliers.  This is because a lot of products are directly shipped from wholesale distribution centres to the end customer.
Without collecting the End Customers name and address, the Client business would not know where to deliver the purchases to. Without collecting the email address and telephone number, it would not be possible to deliver the products via direct shipment, as this is often a mandatory requirement by 3rd party couriers used by wholesale suppliers.

General guidelines for all staff
The only people able to access data covered by this policy should be those who need it for their work.
– Data should not be shared informally. When access to confidential information is required, staff should request it from their line managers.
– Stock Channel Ltd will provide training to all staff to help them understand their responsibilities when handling data.
– Staff should keep all data secure, by taking sensible precautions and following these guidelines.

– Data should be regularly reviewed and updated if it is found to be out of date. If no longer required, it should be deleted and securely disposed of.
– Staff should request help from their line manager or the Data Protection Officer if they are unsure about any aspect of data protection.
Data storage
These guidelines describe how and where data should be safely stored. Staff questions about storing data safely should be directed to the IT Manager. When data is stored electronically, it must be protected from causal unauthorised access, malicious hacking attempts and accidental deletion.
– Data should be protected by strong passwords that are changed regularly and never shared between staff.
– All Data stored on any removable media for the purposes of disaster recovery, (for example; USB Drives, Tapes and DVD) is automatically encrypted. This media should be securely taken offsite and locked away when not being used.
– As policy, general staff DO NOT use, (nor have the option to use) removable media for temporary file storage.
– Data should only be stored on designated drives and servers, and should only be uploaded to approved cloud computing services.
– Servers containing personal data should be sited in a secure location, away from general office space.

These guidelines also apply to data that is usually stored electronically but has been printed out for some reason:

– When not required, the paper and printouts should be kept in a locked drawer or filing cabinet.
– Paper and printouts should be shredded and disposed of securely when no longer required.
Data use
Stock Channel Ltd cannot provide any substantive value to its clients and their end customers unless it can collect and process Personal Details. If personal details are secured to the extent that they cannot be accessed, Stock Channel would ceases to be a viable business.  However, it is when this collected personal data is accessed and processed that it is at the greatest risk of loss, corruption and theft. Staff should therefore take great care to protect confidential data.
– When working with personal details, staff should ensure the screens of their computers are always locked when unattended.
– Personal data should not be shared informally. Data must be encrypted before being transferred electronically. In particular, it should never be sent externally by unencrypted email. The IT manager can explain how to send data to authorised external contacts.
– Staff should not save copies of personal data to their own computers. Staff should always access and update the central server copy of any data.
– Personal data should be never be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
Data accuracy
The law requires Stock Channel Ltd to take reasonable steps to ensure data is kept accurate and up to date. Further, Stock Channel prides itself on our overall data accuracy. It is most important that individual personal data is accurate, and staff should place great emphasis on ensuring its continued precision. It is the responsibility of all staff who work with data to take all reasonable steps to ensure it is kept as accurate and up to date as possible.
– Data should be held in as few places as possible. Staff should not create unnecessary additional data sets.
– Staff should take every opportunity to ensure data is updated, for example: by confirming a Client business user’s details when they call.
– Stock Channel Ltd should make it easy for data subjects to update the information Stock Channel Ltd holds about them. For instance, via their account page on the Stock Channel Ltd website.
– Data should be updated as inaccuracies are discovered. For instance, if a customer can no longer be reached on their stored telephone number, it should be removed from the database.
