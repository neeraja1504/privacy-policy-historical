Use of Cookies
The StomperNet Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize
your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on
your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
personalize StomperNet pages, or register with StomperNet site or
services, a cookie helps StomperNet to recall your specific
information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same StomperNet
Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
so you can easily use the StomperNet features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
features of the StomperNet services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
StomperNet secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or
disclosure. StomperNet secures the personally identifiable
information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure
environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is
transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of
encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
protocol.
Changes to this Statement
StomperNet will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company
and customer feedback. StomperNet encourages you to periodically
review this Statement to be informed of how StomperNet is protecting
your information.
