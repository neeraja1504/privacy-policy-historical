The Statement describes the types of Personal Data we process, namely Personal Data of:
Our suppliers (including content creators and licensors);
Customers;

In respect of information gathered as a result of your use of our Site and or Services, your decision to use this Site and/or our Services and to provide that Personal Data, is voluntary.
