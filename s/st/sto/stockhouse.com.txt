Privacy Policy (Ad Serving)
This article describes Adzerk Inc's privacy policy regarding data collection and usage as part of the ad serving platform it provides to its customers. If you would like information on our privacy policy concerning marketing and customer data please read our Privacy Policy (Customers).
IN A NUTSHELL
Adzerk is an API-based ad serving cloud platform that lets our customers build native ads. Each of our customerâ€™s data belongs to the customer. We don't collect personally identifiable information as part of the ad delivery process. Adzerk doesn't sell or share customer data, visitor data or delivery data. Each customer's data is kept separate from other customers and is not aggregated in any way. Below is information on cookies and why we use cookies (for features like capping the number of times you see specific ads).
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate Adzerk.com, while persistent cookies enable us to track ads a visitor may see over time to limit it from showing too often (for example). You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
HOW WE USE COOKIES
We may collect anonymous usage information that does not identify an individual User ("Non-Personal Information") when Publishers, advertisers, and ad networks use the Adzerk's ad serving platform. Adzerk uses its cookies to serve relevant and targeted advertisements. A visitor receives a cookie from Adzerk when they visit a website where one of our Publishers, Adzertisers, and/or Networks has an ad call. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may result in seeing ads that are not relevant to you.
HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Throughout this policy, we use the term personal information to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user. We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. All credit card information is encrypted with 128-bit SSL encryption before it is transmitted across the network.
DATA RETENTION
We retain the anonymous data that we collect (e.g., which ads you have seen) for a maximum of 12 months from the date of collection after which the information is destroyed. In compliance with the GDPR, for European Union residents we collect data only for those who have consented to be tracked.
HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES
We may share aggregated non-personally identifiable information about you with Publishers or Advertisers, such as the number of users who visit a Publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not identify you individually. Further, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Publishers that you visit. You should contact Publishers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS/SALE OF BUSINESS
We intend to protect your privacy to the fullest extent possible as described in this policy while also fulfilling our responsibility to uphold all applicable laws and regulations. Due to potential legal requirements and other possible circumstances, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed or accessed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. We may be compelled under law to disclose information to government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose any information to law enforcement or other government officials that we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in compliance with the law. In the event that all or part of Adzerk is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, you agree that we may transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy Policy, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.
SECURITY MEASURES
We have implemented reasonable security measures on the Site to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personal information under our control. Additionally, Adzerk takes reasonable steps to ensure that our third party business partners, including our hosting partners, provide sufficient protection for personal information.
