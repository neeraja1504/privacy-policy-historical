Stop Aging Now Privacy & Security
Online Shopping
We secure our online transactions using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard in ecommerce. Credit card transactions are enabled using the VeriSign Payment Flow system which ensures that all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, is encrypted and cannot be viewed as the information travels over the Internet.
The shopping cart uses cookies to make your shopping experience more personalized, and are only used to save you time when visiting again. When ordering, a note is made of the IP address from which the order was placed, and this is done for the security of the credit card holder. Should we find that anyone tries to use a credit card fraudulently, a case of fraud may be opened and handed over to the proper authorities to prosecute the matter.
