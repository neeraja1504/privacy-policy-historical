Cookies
A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are harmless bits of code that an Internet site assigns to your browser to keep track of who you are when you use a Web site. There is no risk of the information on your hard drive being exposed to the outside world since a web site can only read the cookies it creates.
Cookies are sometimes used on the Internet to improve the delivery of services to users by enabling the Web site to “customize” the particular services or information offered to each user.
The Company may employ or use cookies from time to time. You have a choice as to whether you want to participate in the use of cookies before they are used by adjusting your browser settings. Third parties, however, may have their own policies about the use or cookies, and the Company does not have control over these practices. You are responsible for obtaining information about cookies on third party Web sites if you believe this is important to know.
As a general rule, you can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features will not work as intended.
Sharing and transmitting your information
We use USA-based services to host our servers and databases and handle some of our communications, such as emailing and texting. These services do not have access to your personal information and they have strict controls in place to prevent their employees from accessing your information.
Since our servers are based in the United States, your data may travel internationally as we process it. The United States is not a country in respect of which there is a European Commission decision of adequacy, and we protect your privacy and your rights through the use of the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses. More information about these is available here http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087

The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances
The right to stop direct marketing messages or other consent-based processing at any time
The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider

If you want to exercise your rights, have a complaint, or just have questions, please contact us at the email address below.
Security
The Company operates secure systems protected by industry standard procedures, to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.
Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide us. For example, we impose strict rules on employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur; we will make every effort (such as the use of employee passwords and non-disclosure agreements) to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
Changes to how we protect your privacy
We may change this page from time to time, to reflect how we are processing your data. If we make significant changes, we will make that clear on our website or other services, or by some other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before you continue to use StellaService systems.
