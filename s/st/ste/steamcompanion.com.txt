Third Parties
Google Analytics
The website uses Google Analytics with IP anonymization, which we use to determine which pages are slow, or which pages need to be improved. We do not use any custom tracking to identify individual users.

This data includes, but is not limited to Steam Profiles (with the exception of Steam ID, nicknames and avatar), Steam Game libraries, Groups, IP Addresses, and Countries. All other information is deleted when a user decides to delete their account with us.

You have the right for access your data, request changes, and/or erasure of your data free of charge from the service. If you have any requests and/or inquiries please send an email to us and we will help to the best of our abilities. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request.
