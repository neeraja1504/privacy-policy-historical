Traffic Statistics
Tracking software (Google Analytics) is used to analyze traffic to this web site. We do not collect any individually identifiable information nor do we allow it to be shared with any third parties. We will not be upset if you block the script, although it is nice if the stats remain accurate. You can completely opt-out of tracking from Google Analytics using an addon provided by Google.
Email Addresses
The StepMania website will ask you for an email address when registering. Your email address is used only for the purpose of logging into these services and notifications you have opted into (i.e. by pressing "subscribe" on a thread. You can unsubscribe from these in your profile), or for important messages regarding your account. We will never email asking for your account or personal information.
StepMania does not send spam or sell email addresses, and those who do are disgusting.
Cookies
If you register on our site, the system will use a cookie to remember your user name and session information. There's no way around that.
