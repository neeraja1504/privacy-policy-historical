Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:
Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
Google Analytics.  We use a third-party web analytics tool to collect statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns to help us improve the Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this Website and no other identifying information. Although Google Analytics places a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this Website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use [https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html] and the Google Privacy Policy [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/]. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by disabling cookies on your browser, or to opt-out go to Google Analytics Opt-out Tool [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de]
Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This third-party technology deployed on our Website helps us give you the same personalized experience you want – whether you access our Website on your PC, laptop, tablet, or smartphone – by recognizing multiple devices linked to the same person. Learn more about linking your devices or to opt-out, go to Adobe Cross-device Privacy Control Opt-out Tool.
Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our products or services, you can opt-out by logging into the Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an e-mail stating your request using the “Contact Us” form [www.steelcase.com/contact-us/]. If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you may click on the opt-out option included in the email and thus send us a return e-mail asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as a result of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service experience or other transactions.
Accessing and Correcting Your Information
You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an e-mail using the “Contact Us” form [www.steelcase.com/contact-us/] to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
Where We Store and Process Your Information
Given the global nature of our business and the centralization of certain business activities, personal information may be stored and processed internally at different group levels (e.g., global, regional, and local) for lawful purposes where Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We recognize that the EU/EEA countries have an omnibus data protection regime that generally restricts the transfer of personal information about individuals in the EU to the United States and certain other countries, unless there is “adequate protection” for such information when it is received. To address this restriction and equal restrictions in other countries or regions, we apply a consistent set of rules to all transfers of personal information amongst Company entities regardless of their location whether within or outside of the EU/EEA countries. To provide adequate protection for transfers of personal information, Company along with its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses for the Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries (“Model Contract”) pursuant to European Commission Decision 2004/915/EC of 27 December 2004.
Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account, and/or through a notice on the Website home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes.
