Privacy Policy | Stella & Dot
Stella & Dot wants your experience with us to be nothing short of fabulous. We respect the privacy of our Stella & Dot Family Brands Independent Business Owners, customers and those who use our services. To this end, we have systems in place for securely managing your Personal Information. We created this Privacy Policy to help you understand the types of information we collect, how we use and disclose it, your options related to it, and our responsibilities in safeguarding it.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.
This Privacy Policy applies to the Service, and it also applies to collection of your Personal Information from offline sources as described in this Privacy Policy.
"Personal Information" means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
We collect Personal Information when you:
register to use the Service, place an order, or provide contact information to an Independent Business Owner;
register as an Independent Business Owner or express interest in becoming an Independent Business Owner;
use the Service; and
communicate with us.
We also collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Service.
You do not need to provide Personal Information to visit the Service. All Personal Information gathered is on a voluntary basis. If you decide to provide us with your Personal Information, we may store it through whatever means you provided such information (through our Service, Independent Business Owner, via email or facsimile, etc.). By using the Service, submitting a signed Customer Order Form to an Independent Business Owner, or submitting a new Independent Business Owner Agreement to us, you also authorize us to gather, parse, retain, use, and disclose information to provide the Service and our services as described in this Privacy Policy, unless we are notified otherwise.
Customer Online Registration. To register as a customer on our Website, you may need to provide Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and password. You may also provide other optional information, such as your month and day of birth.
Customer Information from Independent Business Owners. Customers may complete and sign a Customer Order Form at a Trunk Show and provide it to an Independent Business Owner. The Independent Business Owner will submit the information to us through the Service so that we may process your order. Customers may also provide their contact information to Independent Business Owners without making a purchase, and Independent Business Owners may save such information in their contact lists on the Service. All Independent Business Owners must abide by this Privacy Policy and must not share information except in connection with their Stella & Dot business.
Independent Business Owner Registration. To register as an Independent Business Owner on our Service, you may need to provide Personal Information, such as your name, social security number, tax identification number, date of birth, email address, telephone number, postal address, and password. You may also provide other information, such as your photograph and information in your completed and digitally signed on-line Independent Business Owner Agreement. Upon the termination of the relationship between Stella & Dot and the Independent Business Owner, Stella & Dot will keep the Independent Business Owner’s Personal Information for lawful purposes only.
Expressing Interest in Becoming an Independent Business Owner. We collect any Personal Information included in requests to learn more about being an Independent Business Owner or hostess. Such information may be submitted to us through the Service or via email. You may also provide Personal Information directly to a Stella & Dot Family Brands Independent Business Owner.
Using the Service. We collect information you post through the Service. For example, when customers sign up for a newsletter, post a photograph, or connect with an Independent Business Owner, the Service will collect the information customers or Independent Business Owners provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information.
Making Payments. When you make payments through the Service or complete a Customer Order Form, your financial account information, such as your credit card number, will be collected by our third-party payment processors. We do not collect or store such financial account information, but we may receive information from our payment processor about the payment, such as the date and time of payment.
Social Plug-Ins.   The Website may allow you to use social media plug-ins, such as Facebook’s “like” or Twitter’s “tweet” functions. The social media plug-ins collect information about you, such as your IP address, when you use them. The privacy policies of the social media services, and not this Privacy Policy, apply to any data collected by the social media plug-ins.
