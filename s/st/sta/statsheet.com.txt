1. NOTICE – INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE.
A. We collect and store information that registered users (“Customers” or “You”) submit to us, such as their names and e-mail addresses, to allow us to identify Customers, provide the Services and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Services. When Customers provide us with their e-mail addresses, they automatically opt-in to receive e-mails from us (including marketing e-mails). If a Customer would like to opt-out of these marketing e-mails, he, she or it can change its settings through its account page. We also collect and store the Customer’s name and phone number if a Customer elects to provide such information, which we use to assist us in providing the Services. We also collect other information from Customers, such as the Customer’s IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers’ use of the Services. Customers’ sessions on the Website are tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer’s account.
B. You may include your personal information in User Content. With our express prior consent, You may include the personal information of third parties in User Content. We use this information for internal research purposes, to operate, manage and improve our Services offerings, and to create Articles.

This may include information about your equipment, your IP address and your browsing actions and patterns when You visit our Website, including the referring and exit pages.
D. Like many other websites, we use a standard technology called “cookies.” Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.

Cookies also allow us to improve the Service. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing You to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

A. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, we will not sell, lease or exchange the personal information of our Customers to third parties without first obtaining their express consent, unless required by law or to protect their status as a Customer. To the extent we do disclose your personal information to a third party to protect your status as a Customer, we will notify You in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Unless we inform You otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
D. The Company may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if the Company, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. Accordingly, You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the Company may continue to use your personal information, including User Content, as set forth in this policy.
E. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
F. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks (see Section 11 below), the Company remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles of third-party agents that the Company engages to process the personal information or data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the Company proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Each of our employees and agents is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees and agents who need it to perform their jobs. Although we have taken measures to keep user information secure that we think are reasonable, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and that we cannot guarantee the security of your information. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom You share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention or hacking of any privacy settings or security measures, and we hereby disclaim all liability related to such third-party action. Any transmission of your information or use of the Services is at your own risk. You can reduce these risks by using common-sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for websites, and using up-to-date antivirus software.
10. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.
If we change this Privacy Policy and seek to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, You will be notified via e-mail or otherwise in some manner through the Services. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect personal information already stored by us, we will post a notice on the Website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post such a notice, we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications from us to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices. If we are using the personal information of any EU individual on the basis of that individual’s consent, and we change this privacy policy to permit any use or disclosure of such EU individual’s personal information that is materially different than the uses for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by such person, we or the applicable Data Controller will obtain such individual’s consent before we make such further uses of such EU individual’s personal information.
