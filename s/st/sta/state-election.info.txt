Our website, as commonly practiced amongst most websites, does collect and use log files containing certain information about the visits to our website such as the number and frequency of visitors to individual pages.

The information we collect is NOT linked to any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. We DO NOT collect information that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our website.
We also use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.
We may also use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising. This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests and may be targeted based on your previous browsing history. DART uses “non personally identifiable information”.

However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could also include the inability to login to services or programs such as forums or accounts.
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
Under no circumstances would we divulge personal information about any individual user to any third party - because we don't have any!.
