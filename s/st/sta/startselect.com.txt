Because the Website and services offered are managed by us, Startselect B.V. (Startselect B.V.), we are responsible for the careful handling of all personal data. In this regard we do, of course, adhere to all requirements imposed by privacy legislation, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation. One of those requirements is that we have to inform you properly about how we handle your data. We do this by means of this privacy and cookie statement.
If you have any questions, you can always contact us. The contact details are included at the end of this statement.
Over time this statement may be subject to changes. It is advisable to regularly consult this statement so that you are aware of any changes.
In this privacy and cookie statement we explain:
what personal data we collect from you and why we need this data;
on what grounds we collect this data;
how long we retain the data for;
whether your data will be passed on to other parties;
what your rights are as regards your data.
On what grounds do we process your data?
The personal data which you provide to us is only processed on one (or a combination) of the following legal grounds, namely:
if it is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you, or to deal with your request to enter into an agreement;
if you have given us permission to do so;
if we have a legitimate interest in so doing;
if we have a statutory duty to do so.
When and why do we process your data?
Registration for an account
We give you the option of creating an account. This can be done either by you yourself providing the data or by registering yourself through your social media account. In the latter case, you consent to us obtaining the necessary data from your social media account. You can always undo this link via the relevant social media platform.
The data which we obtain during registration is used solely to create and make available an account. In the first instance, this involves only your email address and a self-selected password. Your account can then be supplemented by your name (first and last names) and the country in which you live. The IP address from the device with which you visit the Website is also processed automatically for security purposes. All orders which you place from your account are also recorded in your account under order history.
We process and retain your account and the personal data linked to it as long as your account is not removed. Should you wish to remove your account, you can do this by sending a request to us via the contact details below.
The grounds for the above data processing are: the performance of an agreement for providing an account and our legitimate interest in that.
The placement and handling of an order
When you place an order with us, we use your personal data so that we are able to handle the order properly. Your email address, among other things, is then used to supply your order (the code) and/or send an order confirmation.
For this purpose, we use the data necessary for the performance of the agreement, such as your name and email address. In addition, we retain the order data for up to seven years after the order was completed.
The grounds for the above data processing are: preparatory actions for entering into an agreement and the performance thereof, compliance with a legal obligation.
Giving a gift to a third party
When you place an order with us you have the option within the ordering process to indicate that you want to give the code or voucher to a third party as a gift. The name and email address of this third party are used for the purposes of sending the gift digitally.
We use the data necessary to perform the agreement which we have with you, such as the name and email address of the third party. We retain this data up until the point at which the gift is sent to the third party.
We inform the third party to whom the gift was sent about what we do with personal data. The third party is entitled to object to the processing of their personal data after receipt of the gift.
The grounds for the above data processing are: our legitimate interest in the performance of the agreement with the purchaser.
Location data
In some cases, it is necessary for us to ascertain the country from which you are visiting our Website. We do this in order to comply with agreements with our suppliers. We use only your IP address for this purpose.
The grounds for the above data processing are: our legitimate interest.
Newsletter
You can subscribe to our newsletter on the Website. Your email address will only be added to the list of subscribers if you have given your permission for this. You can revoke this permission at any time. Each newsletter has a link with which you can unsubscribe by simply clicking on the link. You can also do this via your account. When you unsubscribe from the newsletter, your email address is immediately removed from our mailing list. The cancellation is saved for a month after you have unsubscribed.
The grounds for the above data processing are: the permission previously provided by you.

We do this only in so far as we need this data to deal with your question or process your feedback.
We keep this information until we are certain you are satisfied with our response and for six months thereafter. In this way we can easily access the information in case of follow-up questions. We can also use it to train our customer service teams to be even better.
The grounds for the above data processing are: the permission previously provided by you and/or performance of the agreement and/or our legitimate interest in that.

Of course, we will respect your privacy at all times. If you do not want this to happen, you can always inform us accordingly.
Your data will not be stored any longer than is necessary for the above-mentioned purposes. If we nevertheless decide to keep data for longer, this data will be anonymised first.
