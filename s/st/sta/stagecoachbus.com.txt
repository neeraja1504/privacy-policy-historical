Before providing information to us via these channels you should check these companies’ privacy policies and settings to understand how they use your personal information.

We recognise that young people use our services and are legally able to provide consent after the age of 13 years. If you are using our travel services and are aged between 13 and 16 years of age we recommend that you read our terms and conditions. When you buy a ticket or travel with us, we will let you know if you need to provide further information and which information is optional.
When you visit our website, app or register to use our on-bus WI-FI services, we may collect the following information automatically:
Technical information, including the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, unique identifiers assigned to your device, your login information, the browser you’re using, time zone setting, browser plug in types and versions, the operating system, device type and platform you are using

When you complete a survey, we may collect additional personal information for customer profiling and monitoring purposes, including (but not limited to): age bands, gender, employment status, postcode and email address.
Whilst we mainly use the personal information that you provide to us, we may sometimes use other public sources of information about our customers and enquirers where you have given your permission for your data to be shared.  We do this to help us understand more about our customers,  to ensure that our public messages are relevant and to make sure that the marketing information we send you, with your consent, is also relevant.  We take great care in sourcing this information but if you prefer us not to use your data in this way then please let us know by contacting ukbus.datacontroller@stagecoachbus.com.
CCTV
We employ CCTV on our buses in order to:
Prevent, deter and detect crime
Apprehend and prosecute offenders, and provide evidence to take action in the courts
Help provide a safer environment for our staff
Protect public safety
Monitor operational and safety-related incidents
Assist with the verification of claims.
You have the right to make a Subject Access Request for CCTV images of yourself and to ask for a copy of them. Please direct any such request to ukbus.datacontroller@stagecoachbus.com. To protect the rights of other individuals whose images may also be captured by the same images, we reserve the right to redact images.
We reserve the right to withhold information where permissible by the applicable data protection legislation, and we will only retain CCTV images for a reasonable period or as long as is required by law. In certain circumstances, we may need to disclose CCTV images for legal reasons. When this is done, there is a requirement for an organisation that has received the images to adhere to the relevant data protection legislation.
Our legal basis for using your personal information
Under UK data protection law, we must have a valid basis for using your personal information and we may not collect store or use information other than as described in this policy. There are four ways we may have a valid basis for using your personal information:
Contract—Most of the information we collect from you is necessary to allow us to fulfil our contract with you or to enter into a contract with you e.g. you provide a billing address when you purchase tickets via our website; we may need to contact you to notify you about changes to our services.
Consent—When you register and open an online account with us you will be invited to give us your consent to use your personal information as described in ‘How we use your personal information for marketing’. By opting in you are giving us your permission to process your data using consent as our legal basis. If you have given consent to our use of your personal information, you are entitled to withdraw this consent at any time.
Legitimate Interests—We have a legitimate interest in using your personal information e.g. to ensure that the content on our website and app is presented to you and your device as effectively as possible. If this is our reason for using your personal information, we must make sure that our interests do not override yours and you can object to this use of your personal information. We also have a legitimate interest in exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Legal Obligation—Lastly, we have a legal obligation to use your personal information where lawfully requested or required to do so by public authorities.
A full description of the different types of personal information we process, the purpose of the processing and the legal basis for the processing is shown below:
Our legitimate interests and your right to object
Legitimate Interests means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business [to enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience].
For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well.
When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests - we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing. If you wish to do so, please let us know by contacting ukbus.datacontroller@stagecoachbus.com.  Please bear in mind that if you object, this may affect our ability to carry out the tasks for your benefit.

How we use your personal information for marketing
We only use your personal information for marketing where you have given us permission to do so or you have provided permission to other organisations to allow us to market to you.
Where you’ve given us permission to do so, we use some of your personal information for marketing. For example, we may use information like name, address, location and past journeys to ensure we make our marketing relevant, accurate, and measure its effectiveness.
By using the information you provide we are able to contact you with specific marketing messages about special offers and promotions, travel tips and latest news and, depending on the permission you have given us or another organisation this may be by post, email, telephone, SMS, social media or other electronic means.
If you have given us your consent to use your personal information for marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting our Data Controller by email ukbus.datacontroller@stagecoachbus.com , clicking the “unsubscribe” link in our marketing emails or replying STOP to a text message.  You can also log into your account on our website or app at anytime to update your marketing opt-in permissions.
Sharing your personal information
Stagecoach Bus may share your information within Stagecoach Group PLC. We do not share or sell your personal information to any other company for marketing purposes.
Third-party companies will be required to use your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection legislation currently in force. We may also use information in aggregate, where personally identifiable information is removed, for marketing and strategic development to improve and support our business.
Where we use trusted suppliers to help us deliver our service to you, we allow the supplier concerned limited access to the personal data they need to provide their service. A list of just some of the service suppliers are listed below:

All personal information sent to our trusted suppliers is transferred securely. In all cases we require these companies to comply strictly with our instructions and they are not allowed to use your information for their own business purposes. We also require these companies to have sufficient organisational and technical measures in place to ensure the security of your personal information.
We may use suppliers who operate outside of the country of which you are a resident, for example in the United States.  These countries may not offer the same legal protection of your personal information as the UK.  If we use one of these organisations, we take appropriate steps to ensure that they provide an adequate level of protection in accordance with UK data protection law.  By submitting your personal information to us you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of your personal information at our approved locations outside the EEA.  If you would like to know more about the ways in which we safeguard your personal information, please get in touch using the contact details in this policy.
Under some circumstances we may be required to disclose or share your information without your consent, for example if we are required by the police, the courts or for other legal reasons.
