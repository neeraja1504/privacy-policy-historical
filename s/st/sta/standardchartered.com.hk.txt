If we contact you in this way you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further information about career opportunities with SCB and you can subsequently opt out at any time by contacting askhr@sc.com
Recruitment Agencies
Your Personal Data may be provided to SCB by recruitment agencies with whom you have registered an interest in working for SCB. Where a recruitment agency refers you to us, a profile will be created for you in our recruitment database based on the information provided and you will receive a notification asking you to log in and complete your candidate profile through a website. Candidates who do not log in and complete their profile within one month will have their profile deleted. Records will be maintained of who decided not to progress so that they are not contacted again.
Other sources
Your Personal Data may also be collected from third parties during the recruitment process such as references from previous employers.
PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA
The processing of your Personal Data for recruitment purposes is:
necessary to consider whether to enter into an employment relationship with you;
necessary to comply with any legal right or obligations to which we are subject in relation to your employment of engagement; or
carried out with your consent, to carry out criminal record checks and pre-employment searches with a credit reference agency, where countries laws permit;
and includes but is not limited to the following:
to process your application including to identify and contact you;
to determine whether you have the professional skills, expertise and experience for the position applied for;
if you are offered a position with SCB, to verify the personal data provided including your identity, address, right to work, employment history and academic background and other background screening purposes including, where allowed by law, criminal record checks, searches with a credit reference agency and sanctions screening checks;
to assist in the administration of the Group’s global recruitment programme, recruitment campaign planning, and compliance with related internal policies; and
to provide you with information about other job vacancies if you would like the SCB to send you such notifications, which may include using data analytics to match your profile against vacant positions
TO WHOM WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
SCB operates globally and any authorised employee, agent and adviser in any country may be involved in processing your recruitment application. They may have access your full candidate profile, interview record psychometric test and background screening results.
Your Personal Data may be disclosed to any of the following for any of the purposes outlined above:
professional advisers, third party service providers, agents or independent contractors providing services to the SCB;
any person in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings, to obtain legal advice or for establishing, exercising or defending legal rights;
any person to whom disclosure is allowed or required by Law and/or Regulation;
any court, tribunal, Regulatory Authority or Governmental Entity;
any criminal records bureau, credit bureau or credit reference agency when conducting background checks;
to third parties to provide references at your request or with your consent; and
third parties to whom we may transfer our rights and/or obligations under any agreement, including but not limited to a potential merger or acquisition of all or part of the Group’s business
In some circumstances, we may provide your personal data to a third party who will determine how and why it will be processed.  For example, where allowed by law we may require successful candidates to complete a pre-employment health assessment.  The Group is an equal opportunities employer committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and will always consider any adjustments which could be made to accommodate ill health or disability.
HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Personal data is retained as long as necessary for the purpose for which it is collected and to meet legal, regulatory and operational requirements. Retention periods may differ for each country. At the end of the retention period, non-identifiable data is kept for management information purposes.
SCB may also retain your contact information for the purposes of inviting you to join our Talent Network. If you join our Talent Network, you will receive information about SCB, invitations to events and/or receive information regarding job opportunities that may be relevant to your skills. If you choose not to join the Talent Network, we will record that fact and will only retain the minimum personal data necessary to ensure you are not contacted again about the Talent Network.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA
The security of your Personal Data is important to us and SCB implements technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data.
As an international organisation, SCB manages its people resources on a global basis and authorised personnel may access your Personal Data in any country in which SCB operates. Your Personal Data may therefore be transferred to employees, agents, advisors or third party service suppliers, and other third parties authorised to act on our behalf in countries that may not offer equivalent data protection or privacy laws to that of the country where you are located. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to security standards mandated by SCB and regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it is kept securely.
If you are applying for a position in the European Union (“EU”) and your personal data is processed in a country outside of the EU, we will put in place contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as providing an adequate level of protection.
You should be aware that the Internet is not a secure form of communication and sending and receiving information over the Internet carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorised third parties. We do not accept responsibility or liability for the confidentiality, security or integrity of your Personal Data in connection with its transmission over the Internet.
UPDATING YOUR RECRUITMENT PROFILE
If you choose to create a profile on any of our websites or any other recruitment channel, it is your responsibility to maintain and update the personal data provided by you in your profile and SCB may from time to time request, via email that you update your Personal Data to ensure it is accurate. You can access, update or delete your Personal Data in your profile at any time.
PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENTS
Psychometric assessments may be undertaken to measure some aspects of performance including technical skills, and/or personality traits such as temperament or situational judgement. Specialist third parties are used to decide which assessments are relevant to use, as well as to administer them and assess the results. Some assessments may be used to determine whether you progress to the next stage of the recruitment process. If you do not consent to psychometric assessments where we deem it appropriate as part of the recruitment process, your application will not be able to be progressed.
BACKGROUND SCREENING
If you are offered a position with SCB, the accuracy of the personal data you have provided will be verified by our third party background screening vendors.
A criminal record search will be undertaken where allowed by applicable law. You may also be required to consent to such checks being undertaken. If you do not give your consent where required, we will not be able to continue with the recruitment process including the withdrawal of an offer of employment. SCB has a policy on the recruitment of ex-offenders which is available on request.
We may also use the services of a credit reference agency (“CRA”) to verify public information such as county court judgments, bankruptcies, decrees and administration orders. The CRA will record that such a search has been made about you but it will not affect your credit rating.
Where there are anomalies or discrepancies you will be contacted by a recruitment specialist and you may be required to supply further personal data to enable further enquiries/verification to be completed.
If you do not provide information where requested, provide misleading, false or inaccurate information or withhold any material information, we reserve the right to stop the recruitment process including withdrawing an offer of employment.
MINORS
SCB recruitment activities are generally not aimed at minors. If you are a minor in the relevant jurisdiction, you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian before contacting SCB in relation to recruitment.
