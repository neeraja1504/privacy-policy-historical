HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WITH WHOM IT IS SHARED
**When you make travel arrangements with STA Travel and you provide information about yourself, we use this information to complete your order (i.e., to complete air, hotel, car, and other reservations), fulfill any customer service requests, and provide promotional or trip related information via email or direct mail. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfill your travel arrangements. Such other parties may include, but are not limited to, appropriate airlines and other travel suppliers, credit card merchant services, airline reservation systems, and other global distribution systems.
These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to hotel, airline, cruise, rental car, and other travel suppliers whose products you have purchased. Although STA Travel attempts to select travel suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on statravel.com. In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation.
In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, STA Travel may use certain data for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits. We may also use PII to provide you other services, such as sending you an email notification regarding the status of your travel plans or informing you about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, flight specials, trip information, or other travel opportunities from STA Travel or its marketing partners.
Although no PII is collected, we monitor usersâ€™ navigation of our Web site in order to better understand and serve our customers. We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their Web sites.
When you are on the Web site and are asked for PII, you are sharing that information with STA Travel and it will not be shared with third parties, except as set forth elsewhere in this privacy policy.
We may collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through sweepstakes, raffles, and promotions. We will share PII that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This policy will not cover the use of your PII by these other companies. We encourage you to read a company's privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services.
STA Travel may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it.
