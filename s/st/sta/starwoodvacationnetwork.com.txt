With these fill-in forms, you have the ability to choose the information you wish to share with us. You will be informed about how Vistana may use such information, including whether it will be shared with Strategic Marketing Partners. In most cases, the information you provide is added to our database in order for us to provide personally tailored messages which are delivered online and off-line.
Vistana may also collect information using automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment and browsing activities and patterns. Our automatic data collection activities are further described in the Cookies and Invisible Pixels section of this Policy.
Vistana may contract with third-party service providers to deliver services and customer solutions. Service providers, which may change or be added from time to time, are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Vistana and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Vistana. Situations in which Vistana may disclose your information to others include:
When you have not objected to these types of disclosures or, in those jurisdictions where we are required to obtain your permission, when we have received your consent to do so;
In situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you requested (e.g., a vacation package);
When companies or service providers that perform business activities on behalf of Vistana require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration, or database management services);
When a hotel or other property leaves the Vistana system and access to your personal information is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations;
In the event Vistana is merged with or acquired by another company;
To comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law, a court order or a subpoena, to enforce the right of a lender, owners’ association, or foreclose on a property interest; and
In case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual.
If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your personal information and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

The websites may collect personal information through behavioral tracking. As you navigate through and interact with our websites, Vistana, its vendors, and marketing partners may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns by using cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons. These help us deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns; store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our websites according to your individual interests; and speed up your searches.
Web Beacons and Invisible Pixels. Vistana uses invisible pixels and web beacons to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels and web beacons is used and reported in the aggregate. Vistana may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.
Cookies. Cookies are used to:
Remember your user name and password for future visits so log in is easier and faster;
Ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content;
Ensure you obtain all requested information; and
Help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location.
Vistana cookies assign your computer or other device with a unique identifier, which in turn becomes your identification card whenever you return to a Vistana website. Cookies are small data files that most websites store, access, and maintain on the hard drive of your computer. Most browsers now automatically accept cookies by default but they can be set so that all or some cookies are rejected automatically or are accepted or rejected on a case-by-case basis at the user’s option.
Below we explain the different types of cookies that may be used on our websites. For a full list of the cookies we employ, please see the section labeled Cookie Choices.
Essential Cookies. Essential cookies are necessary for our websites to work, and to enable you to navigate them and use their services and features. As disabling these cookies would make the services and features unavailable, we are not required to provide you with an opt-out consent mechanism.
Customization Cookies. Customization or preference cookies store your choices and preferences allowing us to remember language or other local settings and to customize our websites accordingly.
Analytics Cookies. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of Vistana websites and enable us to identify problems, determine the efficacy of our advertising, and understand how aggregate traffic moves on and to our websites.
Advertising Cookies. Advertising cookies allow us to show you the most relevant products, offers, advertisements, and personalized content and help us provide you with an online experience that’s tailored to your needs.
We may also work with vendors and marketing partners to help deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. These vendors and marketing partners include advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, data exchanges, analytics providers, and other similar providers. Please click here for a current list of the agencies and providers with which we work. These partners and vendors use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at Vistana and other third- party websites) in order to help Vistana and third-party advertisers deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on Vistana or other websites. For example, if you go to a Vistana website to look at one of our properties or to book a villa, you may later see an advertisement from us when you visit another website. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on websites other than the Vistana websites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with which we think our website visitors would have an interest. We allow these advertisers to deliver co-branded messages (e.g., Vistana and the advertiser) directly to consumers who have visited our websites. These types of co-branded advertisements may appear on Vistana or on third-party websites. In general, you can click here to opt out of our vendors’ use of cookies to tailor personalized content or advertising or visit:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
We also work with vendors to deliver our advertisements directly to those who are traveling or about to travel. For example, when you print your boarding pass online, one of our vendors may drop a cookie on your computer, identifying your computer with a unique identifier and a code indicating your destination. We use this vendor to deliver advertisements to you indicating our available properties in the destination indicated on your boarding pass.
Cookie Choices
