What Do We Share With Third Parties?
From time to time we may employ third parties to help us provide or improve Staffino.

We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the terms of use for a new service or by revising this Privacy Policy.
We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including messages) to a third party without your consent:
a) if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities,
