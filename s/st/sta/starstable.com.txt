Actual credit card or payment data is not stored by Star Stable Online but by our international-hosted payment providers. To be able to store information of this nature, we only use regulated providers who conform to the highest level of security.
How do we handle your data rights at Star Stable?
To follow the EU legislation as well as an increasing Global demand for enhanced data privacy we have updated our data handling processes and will continue delivering improved support to strengthen your personal rights to control how we at Star Stable handle your data.

We will notify you if the process will take longer than 30 days.
CAN I REQUEST INFORMATION OR ASK FOR MY PERSONAL DATA TO BE REMOVED?
As a registered player you can request for your old email address to be removed.
As a registered parent or legal guardian, you can request for any old email addresses to be deleted or payment methods to be removed.
For safety purposes we securely store and archive old data. This is so it can be used to investigate any complaints or violations of our terms and conditions, or on the off-chance that it has been requested by law enforcement agencies or data protection authorities.
Most of the data is fully available for you as a registered player under “My Account” or in the game. Please contact @Privacy (see section 11 below) if you have any additional requirements on obtaining more information about your persona data.
CAN I MOVE MY DATA FROM STAR STABLE?
Star Stable is under the EU GDPR law considered to be a Data Controller. As part of the law you should be able to move or port out your data to another Data Controller where so is applicable. For Star Stable this is only applicable to the private persons requesting the data since the products and services cannot be transferred to another Company.
Community or social features we offer and how we keep these areas safe.
Star Stable Online offers in-game chat and mail for our users. To keep our players safe, and actively prevent the exchange of personal information in line with COPPA and General Data Protection Regulation requirements, all in-game communications are filtered and behavior-profiled using technology provided by industry leader CRISP THINKING. All chat and mails are stored securely for investigation purposes should there be any cause for our trained team of moderators to thoroughly examine an interaction (such as a complaint, a violation of our terms of service, or a request for information from a law enforcement agency).
This is currently the only automated decision making at Star Stable.
