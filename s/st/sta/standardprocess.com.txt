Privacy Policy
Last Updated on 02/13/2015
Standard Process Inc. (“Standard Process”) shares your concerns about privacy on the Internet. In order to better protect your privacy, Standard Process has provided this notice explaining its online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information that Standard Process collects on its website, www.standardprocess.com, (“Website”) and does not apply to information that Standard Process may collect by any alternative means or media.
Standard Process’ Collection and Use of Your Information
In the course of using the Website, Standard Process may ask users for their name, email address, postal address, mobile or other telephone number, fax number, care provider’s name, and payment information, as well as other relevant information. Health care providers will be asked to provide information specific to their clinics, such as clinic name, address, telephone number, and website URL. Standard Process may also collect account registration information, including usernames, passwords, and answers to security questions. In many cases, users choose the amount of information they supply. There may be instances in which some of the information that we ask users to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if users do not provide mandatory personal information with respect to a particular activity, users will not be able to engage in that activity. Standard Process also may collect certain information that is not personally identifiable when you visit many of our Web pages, such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, aggregate data about the number of visits to the Website, and/or aggregate data about the pages visited. Information gathered through the Website may be transferred, used, and stored in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we, our agents, customers, and other users of the Website are located, and by accessing the Website, you consent to the transfer, use, and storage of your information in those jurisdictions.
How Standard Process Uses the Information
Standard Process uses the information that is not personally identifiable (“Aggregate Data”) to improve the design and content of the Website and to enable Standard Process to personalize your online experience. Standard Process may use the Aggregate Data to analyze Website usage as well as create services and/or products to fit your needs. Also, Standard Process may share this Aggregate Data with Standard Process’ related entities, advertisers, partners, and/or other third-party vendors.

Standard Process will share user product order information, including the items and quantities ordered, with the user’s health care provider who recommended the product(s). In all cases, however, Standard Process’ agents, employees, and contractors who have access to Personal Information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, Standard Process encourages all its business partners to adopt and adhere to standards of protection consistent with this Privacy Policy.
