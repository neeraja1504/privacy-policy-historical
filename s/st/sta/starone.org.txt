Privacy Policy - Star One Credit Union
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand Star One Credit Union's Privacy Policy.
At Star One Credit Union, we respect the privacy of our members. We recognize the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your personal financial information. This notice describes the privacy policy and practices followed by Star One Credit Union. This notice explains what types of member information we collect and under what circumstances we may share it.
The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the accounts or services you have with us. This information can include:
Name, address, Social Security number, and income
Account balances and transaction history
Credit history and credit scores
When you are no longer our member, we will not share your information except as permitted or required by law as described in this notice.
All financial companies need to share members' personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their members' personal information; the reasons Star One Credit Union chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
How does Star One Credit Union protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We also restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and volunteers who need to know the information to provide products or services to you.
How does Star One Credit Union collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you

Why can't I limit all sharing?
Federal law only gives you the right to limit information sharing as follows:
sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes-information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
However, we do not have any affiliates with whom we share any information.
