Startups.com Web Site Information
Startups.com is an online service that allows its members to create and share business plans as well as connect and interact with other members. Users are represented on the site with personal profiles. You choose the information in your profile and therefore control what can be seen by other users. Startups.com must collect certain pieces of information in the normal course of its business and Startups.com retains the ownership rights to this information including text and all media formats.
Primary Information Types
There are several primary types of information that are collected including Contact, Profile, and Internet information.

Following registration, Startups.com users will be prompted to complete a profile. Current users can also make changes to their own user profile. A user profile may contain, but is not limited to, your name, a personal statement, your photo, your video, and other information that may be used in a casting or other contact proposal. You should use good judgment about the information that you post in your profile since this can be viewed by others on the Startups.com.
