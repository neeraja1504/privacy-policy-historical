ARBITRATION.
YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES, ACTIONS, AND CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OR ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS AND/OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY “CLAIMS”) WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW, AND LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE USER’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR CLASS PROCEEDING. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT ACT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS AGAINST STAGE IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS. YOUR CLAIMS SHALL NOT BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER PARTY SUBJECT TO THESE TERMS, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Harris County, Texas. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submission, or in person by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
We will pay all administrative, hearing, and arbitrator’s fees and costs for the arbitration that are in excess of any filing fee that you would have been required to pay to file your Claims as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater). Unless the arbitrator awards otherwise, you will be responsible for paying the fees for your lawyers, witnesses (including experts), and all other expenses you incur. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case. The arbitration award may be entered as a judgment only to enforce the award itself and cannot be used as evidence in any other case. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
Either party shall have the right to seek an injunction or other equitable relief related to infringement, violation, or a threat to infringe or violate the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights. The parties may seek such injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in Harris County, Texas. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in Harris County, Texas.
SURVIVAL; SEVERABILITY. The arbitration provision of this Privacy Policy will survive the termination of the relationship between you and Stage. To the maximum extent possible, if any provision of these Terms shall be interpreted is deemed by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful or unenforceable, it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Additionally, any unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so as to be rendered valid and enforceable while implementing, to the greatest extent possible, the original intent of such provision.
