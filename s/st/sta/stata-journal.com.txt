Privacy notice
Stata.com privacy notice
This privacy notice is provided by StataCorp LP. Orders for the Stata Journal are processed by StataCorp.
We do not maintain a web database of customer names, addresses, or credit cards.
Customer information for those customers residing in countries for which we have a distributor is shared with the distributor for their country. Note that we sell Stata directly to customers in the US and Canada.
We do not sell or give to any third party (except for our distributors) any customer information. The information that you give us is entered into a customer database system (written in Stata, of course), and this information is only accessible by StataCorp employees.
Sometimes we receive a request from a customer who wants to be told of other Stata users at their institution. We do not give out this information without first getting your permission, and we seek permission for each instance.
When you order from us, we send email to confirm that we received the order, another email to confirm that the order was processed, and a third to provide you with tracking information and to confirm that the items were shipped. We do not send unsolicited email to our customers.
Purchase information is transferred to StataCorp using a secure connection.
