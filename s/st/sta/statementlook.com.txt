Effective Date: November 23, 2001
Thank you for visiting the Statementlook web site, operated by First Data Resources Inc. (FDR) in cooperation with the credit card issuers FDR serves. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our Online Privacy Statement is designed to inform you about our online collection and use of personal information. This Online Privacy Statement reflects the policies covering personal information collected by us on this web site, on or after the effective date shown above.
Collection and Use of Information
Except as otherwise provided below, the only personal information we collect about you online is information you voluntarily provide us. We collect and use the information you provide to us online only as necessary to verify your identity and provide you with the information or services you have requested.
In addition to the information you provide to us, our web site software may collect information about your browser type in order to assist you in accessing and viewing your information on our web site, and we may collect information about the number of times you access information on our web site for administrative purposes.
Disclosure of Information
It is our policy to treat your account information as confidential. We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transactions you make ONLY:
as necessary to complete a transaction you have authorized;
as requested by your credit card issuer; or
as necessary to comply with a government agency or court order.
Security
At Statementlook, security is a priority. We take every precaution, including the use of advanced technology, to protect personal information collected online against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. The information you provide to us on our web site is encrypted and protected with an encryption method called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, the padlock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just 'surfing'. We continually review and enhance our security systems to protect your information and ensure the integrity of that information.
