Starkey.com Privacy Policy & Terms of Use
This site is owned and operated by Starkey Hearing Technologies. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Starkey Hearing Technologies, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. Rest assured that the information you provide is safeguarded. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
Information Starkey Hearing Technologies gathers and tracks
We gather two types of information about users:
* Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. We collect this information to customize our features for individual visitors who are Starkey Hearing Technologies customers and to notify customers about updates to our site and products or services.
* Information Starkey Hearing Technologies gathers through aggregated tracking is used to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. We collect this information in order to determine how to create the best experience for our customers. We may track search terms entered in our Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users, but this tracking is never associated with an individual user.
Policy amendment
Starkey Hearing Technologies approaches Internet communications with a strong commitment to individual privacy rights and concerns. As the Internet evolves, our policy will continue to change and develop. We therefore reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time with or without prior notice. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the sites following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
