Where we do this, we have written contracts in place between the companies within the STATS group to ensure your privacy is secure and respected.
SHARING YOUR DATA WITH TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES
We share your personal data with trusted third parties to allow us to provide our services to you. When we do share your data with these third parties, STATS will enter into written contracts with them, which require them to only use your data for the purpose we specify to them and that your privacy is secure and respected.
These trusted third parties include the following:
Professional service providers such as website hosting providers, credit card payment processor (i.e. BluePay) system providers, website analytics providers, companies who help us manage contact information from prospective customers (e.g. Marketo and Cloudingo) and to process opportunities with actual customers, e.g. Salesforce, all to help us run our business;
Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud.

INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
We may receive information about you from publicly available sources, such as LinkedIn or information which is published in the media.
We may combine the information you have given us, with information obtained from other sources, but we will only do this when we have a lawful basis to do so.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ** **
We are a global business head-quartered in the US. This means that your personal data may be transferred to or accessed from outside the EU/EEA in a jurisdiction that is not governed by EU data protection laws. However, safeguards are in place to protect personal data, as set out below.
STATS LLC will process personal data in the US for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Any transfers of personal data from STATS group entities in the EU to STATS LLC in the US will be protected by the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding STATS’ collection and use of personal data from the European Union member countries. STATS adheres to the following privacy policy in connection with its receipt and processing of personal data from the European Union (EU) for use in the context of the relationship (as identified above) under the Privacy Shield. STATS agrees to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities and comply with the advice given by such authorities with respect to this personal data. STATS has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. STATS is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Principles, and to view STATS’ certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov. STATS is registered with International Centre for Dispute Resolution/American Arbitration Association (ICDR/AAA) who will act as STATS’ alternative dispute resolution provider in the event that any privacy concerns are not resolved by STATS. You may contact ICDR/AAA at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html. Alternative dispute resolution will be at STATS’ expense. Under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration. Please access the above links for further information or contact us using the details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Personal data may be processed by other STATS entities (other than STATS LLC in the US) located outside the EU/EEA from time to time, e.g. STATS Systems India Private Limited and STATS Analytics Australia Pty. Ltd in order to fulfill STATS’ contract obligations to provide services to a customer. When this occurs, the transfer is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses which have been entered into by the relevant STATS entities located outside the EU/EEA.
A number of our service providers are also located (or will access your personal data from) outside the EU/EEA, e.g. Salesforce, Marketo, and BluePay. In all such cases, we will enter into Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the data. In certain circumstances, STATS may be liable under the Privacy Shield if these service providers who perform services on our behalf, process such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield. For more information about Standard Contractual Clauses, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries.
HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA? ** **
We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need to for the reason we collected it, as set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, for as long as needed to allow us to provide our services or to provide any support you have requested.
We may also keep hold of some of your personal data if we are required to do so for legal purposes, for example, to meet our legal or regulatory requirements or to prevent fraud and abuse.
** ** SECURITY ** **
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure and we have put in place suitable administrative, technical, physical, contractual and managerial measures, including our information security management system, to protect your personal data from loss, theft, unauthorised use, disclosure or modification, including encryption, where appropriate. Our employees who have access to and process your personal data are obliged to respect the confidentiality and security of your personal data.

access to the personal data we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request”) including a copy of it;
