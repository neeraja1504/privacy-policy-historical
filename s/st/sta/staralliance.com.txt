Collection and Use of Data
General
In order to access or request certain functionalities or services available on our website, you may be required to enter information that qualifies as personal data.
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal Data”).
Star Alliance Services GmbH (“Star Alliance”) only collects Personal Data to the extent that you provide it to us in relation to specific features on our website, such as our newsletter.
Personal Data may also be collected by third party service providers through external websites to which we provide a link, as shall be described below.
In addition, Star Alliance collects information in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with a specific natural person, such as but not limited to, language, current location, IP address (to the extent that it cannot be traced back to a specific street address) and user activity on the Star Alliance website (“Non-Personal Data”).  If Star Alliance combines Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, the combined data will be treated as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.
Personal Data is not collected for any purpose other than for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
The means in which your Data – both Personal and Non-Personal – is collected on or through our website, regional websites or linked third party websites shall be described throughout the following sections.

Star Alliance does not collect, store or process any of the Personal Data you fill-in using the Book & Fly tool, as your request is redirected from our domain to an external website at the time of booking.
