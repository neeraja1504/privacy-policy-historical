We may use your personal information to better assist you when you visit or call us again and to send you special offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. Occasionally we may send you special offers from other TABcom properties. You may opt out of these offers at any time by clicking the opt-out link in the email. We do this by print advertising, including regular mail and catalogs, by e-mail, by telephone and with general marketing communications for product or service-specific information.
Unless you "opt-out" through opportunities available to you through our various communication vehicles, we may send you emails, catalogs or other promotional material. You may also "opt-out" of future State Line Tack communications by following the instructions provided in this Policy under Accessibility and Use of Your Personal Information.
When visiting our Site , if you register for an online account or for any online offers, we may ask you to provide personal information and to select a password of your own choice to help keep personal information secure. We may use your registration information to help make your online shopping experience and orders quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.
When you make online purchases , we will collect your name, physical address, phone number, e-mail address and billing/shipping information, as well as credit card information. This information enables us to deliver products that you have ordered; fulfill your requests; contact you or the recipient(s) of your purchase in the event of order or delivery difficulties; verify or respond to your inquiries and deliver services and information about our products or Site to you. If you make a purchase through our Site, the personal information you provide (for example, name, physical address and e-mail address) will be added to our customer database. Our customer database may be used to send future State Line Tack communications to you, unless you specifically opt-out. Note: Online purchases require use of an e-mail address to process the order.
We may share your personal information with carefully selected third-party service providers in order to provide services to you , such as to fulfill orders (U.S. Postal Service or other delivery companies); process payments; send State Line Tack communications; monitor Site activity; conduct surveys; maintain our customer database; send mail and e-mail and administer drawings, contests, and rebates. We will share your personal information with our carefully selected third-party services providers on a confidential basis. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than providing State Line Tack services.
We may combine the personal information you provide to us (on our Site, at our store, through our catalogs and programs) with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us; improve the accuracy of our customer database (such as the U.S. Post Office to verify accuracy of addresses); increase our understanding of our customers; identify potential customers; and send State Line Tack marketing communications.
We may be required to disclose your personal information for legal reasons , such as in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and State Line Tack. We may also release personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. We will require such parties to treat your personal information in accordance with our Policy and to use and disclose your personal information solely for the purposes for which it was collected.

Our Site uses "cookie" technology. A "cookie" is a small data file that a Website may send to your Web browser and store on your hard drive. Our Site uses cookies to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and session and allow you to move within areas of our Site without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies.
You may choose to set your Web browser to not accept cookies. If your cookies are disabled, you can still view our site and make a purchase.
We may carefully select third-party advertising companies to collect information by using cookies when you visit our Site.

We respect your right to choose whether to be included in the services that these third parties provide. For more details about your choices for no longer having information from these third-party cookies used by these companies or provided to us, please see Accessibility and Use of Your Personal Information below.

Whether you are shopping online or through our catalogs, we have security measures in place to help protect against loss, unauthorized access and alteration of the information in our control. We only will disclose such information to employees and authorized service providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Policy.
State Line Tack's databases are protected by physical, technical and procedural measures that restrict information access to authorized persons in accordance with this Policy. Although no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot ensure against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration,or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Our information systems are maintained behind a firewall to isolate them from access by other networks connected to the Internet, and access to personally-identifiable information is granted only to associates who need the information to perform a specific job.

SECURE ONLINE SHOPPING
Because your credit card security is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure your payment information is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. Our Site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your credit card information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, physical address and credit card number.
To provide you with an increased level of security online, you may also select a password to access your personal information when you register for an online account. State Line Tack will not ask you for your password in an unsolicited communication.

The safety of children is very important to us. Consequently, State Line Tack does not knowingly or intentionally collect information from persons under 13 years of age without parental consent. If you are under 13 and wish to purchase items from our Site or wish to provide personal information, ask a parent or guardian for assistance. State Line Tack cannot prohibit minors from visiting our Site and must rely on parents and guardians to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13.
