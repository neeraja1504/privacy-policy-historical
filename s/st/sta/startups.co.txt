Startups.co Web Site Information
Startups.co is an online service that allows its members to create and share business plans as well as connect and interact with other members. Users are represented on the site with personal profiles. You choose the information in your profile and therefore control what can be seen by other users. Startups.co must collect certain pieces of information in the normal course of its business and Startups.co retains the ownership rights to this information including text and all media formats.
Primary Information Types
There are several primary types of information that are collected including Contact, Profile, and Internet information. Credit Card information may also be accepted for membership fees and other services. Startups.co is in no way limited to the collection of only this type of information and may deem it necessary to collect other data. You will be notified if any changes are made to this policy via a posting on this website.

Upon registering as a Startups.co user, certain contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address may be collected. This serves as an example and is not intended to be a complete list of information that may be collected at registration.
Profile
Following registration, Startups.co users will be prompted to complete a profile. Current users can also make changes to their own user profile. A user profile may contain, but is not limited to, your name, a personal statement, your photo, your video, and other information that may be used in a casting or other contact proposal. You should use good judgment about the information that you post in your profile since this can be viewed by others on the Startups.co. Your personal contact information CANNOT be viewed unless you release this information. Additionally, the information in your profile can be edited at your discretion at any time.
