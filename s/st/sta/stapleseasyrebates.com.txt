We use the personal information we collect to process your orders, identify you within our systems, contact you if we have questions about your order, notify you about new services or special promotional programs, and submit for rebates. Staples and the sponsoring manufacturer will have access to any rebate information you provide.
We share your personal information within the Staples family of businesses and with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf (for example, credit card companies, financial institutions, shipping companies, printing houses, consultants and advisors, market research firms and rebate processors) and when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, injury, or harm to persons or property, to protect our rights or the rights of others, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or as otherwise required by law. We limit the scope of the information provided to third parties, and we allow its use only for the purposes for which it was disclosed. Personal information may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any Staples business or asset to which the information pertains. If you shop at a retail store, through our catalog, or via Staples.com®, we may share your name and mailing address (but not your e–mail address or telephone number) for external direct mail campaigns conducted by companies or organizations which offer products or services we believe may be of interest to our customers. Staples National Advantage® and Staples Business Advantage® customer information is not shared for this purpose.
