A big Star86 welcome to parents, teachers and other concerned adults. Our website, Star86.com, is hosted by Podscape Holdings Ltd., a New Zealand company with offices at 114 St Georges Bay Rd, Parnell, Auckland 1052, New Zealand. On this site kids can participate in a virtual online environment, giving them the opportunity to explore a virtual universe. With parental permission we also provide kids with the ability to have controlled communications, using limited and moderated chat messages with other kids. In this policy we describe what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it (the policy covers only information collected and used on Star86.com).
Star86 gives you the ability to have controlled interaction with your friends. We have tried to make this a fun and friendly environment, but the environment on Star86.com also depends on you. Whenever using this site, or any social networking website, you should be careful about the interactions you have with others.
Podscape Holdings Ltd. strives to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, (COPPA) a U.S. law that governs the use and collection of information online from kids under 13. To learn more about this law, and about how to protect your kids on interactive online websites, visit the FTC website.
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
Registration
When users, including children under 13, register and create an account on Star86.com, Podscape Holdings Ltd. asks them to select a screen name, and a password; and to provide his or her parent or guardian's email address for children under 13, the child's age, gender, and country of residence. Users 13 or older will provide their own email address. In the interactive community features, no additional personally identifying information is collected.
In order to use this website, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on the registration form, including a username and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (your parent email address if you are under 13 years of age). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. Occasionally, Star86.com sends out updates regarding new site features, via parent announcements and our newsletter. We also need to contact you regarding any Customer Service queries you submit, such as password retrieval.
As part of the registration process, we require demographic information (gender, country of residence and birth date); we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience. We limit the information we collect, both actively (i.e., what we ask kids) and passively (what we collect through use of web tracking mechanisms like “cookies,”) to that which is necessary for kids to take part in a particular Star86 game activity.
Podscape Holdings Ltd. is the sole owner of the information collected on Star86.com. Podscape Holdings Ltd. collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website including registration and Customer Service contact queries.
Orders
If you purchase a produce or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on your order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email address, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card information and expiration date).
Agents/Service Providers
We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. We use email and the telephone to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order. When you sign up for Click n Buy, we will share your email address, country of residence, and Star86 Account ID as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

How Star86 Uses the Information it Collects
Star86 uses the parent or guardian's email address provided at registration to notify parents that their kids have created an account on Star86.com. In that initial notice, parents are provided a link to this privacy policy, and details about how their kids can use Star86.com. Parents are required to provide their consent before their kid's accounts can be activated. Parent email addresses are used to communicate with parents about their kids in relation to their activity at Star86.com such as a forgotten password. Upon activation of an account, the information submitted will be used by Star86 to create a personalized avatar and will allow the registered user to participate on the Star86.com website, which contains a variety of interactive community features. Within those features, users are identified in the community by their screen name, age, gender and country of origin. This limited (and non-personal) identifying information, accompanied by a picture of their avatar, will be displayed to the user or kid's friends and other users of the site. If you want to read more about how our site operates, we encourage you to read our Parent's Page.
Parental Rights
Parents and legal guardians of kids under 13 who are members of Star86.com have certain rights under COPPA, and Star86 recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a kid's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently the only identifiable information we collect from children is the parent email address. We will not knowingly register children under 13 years old on Star86.com without parental consent. Without consent, a child under 13 cannot use any of the community features. If a parent does not provide consent, we will delete the information provided during the registration process within a reasonable time period.
A child's participation or access to an activity on our site is not conditioned on their providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. Parents/guardians can review information their children have contributed to Star86.com, request that Star86 delete that information, and refuse to allow Star86 to collect further information from their kids by contacting our Customer Services department by email at support@Star86.com. Parents should include their kid's username and the registered (parent's) email address in the email so we can better assist them with their inquiry or request. Star86 may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their kid's information, or a request to refuse further collection from kids.
Links to Third Party Websites
We provide links to third party websites, including links from our “Buy Stuff” feature. Through that feature, we let our users know where they can purchase Star86 merchandise. Before a player can exit our website, we explain that the player is leaving our website, and going to the website of a third party. Once they leave our site, he or she may submit information to a third party, over whom we have no authority or control, and who may have different information collection and use practices. Users and Parents/guardians should always read a company's privacy policy carefully, including those companies to whom we provide links, before submitting information to them.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Star86 does not share, rent or trade personally identifying information about our registered users, including kids under 13, with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., companies who are not one of our corporate affiliates or who are not providing support to the internal operations of our company) for their promotional purposes. Star86 makes every reasonable effort to disallow and discourage users and kids from sharing personally identifying information with each other via the community features via a filter system and live moderators. The only information that can be openly shared in the Star86.com community features are screen names (and kids are cautioned not to select their real names), country of residence, age, gender and moderated messages. Users and kids who use the pin board features do have the opportunity to draft their own messages to their friends, but we do not prompt any site users to provide any identifying information about themselves. Star86 may share other information submitted on its site - non-personal information - to provide requested products or services, if permission is granted, or under the following circumstances: We share personal information in certain cases in order to prevent, take action against or investigate situations regarding illegal activities, fraud or suspected fraud, events in which threats or potential threats to the physical safety of any person or persons is evident, when violations of Star86's terms of use occur, or in other situations required by law. We respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal processes, or make use of information in exercising our legal rights or establishing defense against legal claims. We transfer information about users if Star86 is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Star86 notifies the user in advance of any information transfer and before it may become subject to any other privacy policy. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
