We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to risks inherent in processing personal information. This includes on premise security of STAAH computer software.
We encrypt any sensitive information that is transmitted via our website (such as credit card numbers) using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Please do not disclose your password to third parties. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security.
Accessing and correcting your personal information
Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the NZ Privacy Act or other applicable law, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.
In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction. If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.
If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at marketing@staah.com. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).
While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the collection, processing and transfer of EU individuals’ personal data (as defined in the GDPR). The personal information described in our privacy policy is personal data under the GDPR. We are committed to complying with the GDPR when dealing with Account and Marketing Data about our website visitors and product or service users based in the EU.

our customers are the data controller when processing Customer Data
We will not process Customer Data except as provided in our agreements with our customers and we require our customers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws. If we receive any data subject requests relating to Customer Data, such as requests to access personal data, we will forward this request to the relevant customer.

PROCESSESING PERSONAL DATA
The personal data we may process consists of the Account and Marketing Data described in our privacy policy. This Account and Marketing Data may be processed for the purposes outlined in our privacy policy.
The legal basis for our processing of Account and Marketing Data is your consent and, for certain Account and Marketing Data, processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or for our legitimate interests (except where such interests would be overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data).
Despite the above, we may process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance with applicable laws.
You do not have to provide us with your name or contact information to access and use certain parts of the website. You do have to provide us with information that is automatically collected by Google Analytics during your use of the website (location, browser and operating system details), however, this is not personal information. For further information on cookies, please see our Cookies Policy. You must provide us with your name and contact information to access your account or if you wish to contact us. The consequence of not providing your name and contact information is that we will not be able to provide you with an account or contact you.
Your rights
Your rights in relation to your personal data under the GDPR include:
right of access - if you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your personal data and provide you with a copy of that personal data.
right to rectification - if the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to have it rectified or completed. We will take every reasonable step to ensure personal data which is inaccurate is rectified. If we have shared your personal data with any third parties, we will tell them about the rectification where possible.
right to erasure - we delete your personal data when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which you provided it. You may request that we delete your personal data and we will do so if deletion does not contravene any applicable laws. If we have shared your personal data with any third parties, we will take reasonable steps to inform those third parties to delete such personal data.
right to withdraw consent - if the basis of our processing of your personal data is consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
right to restrict processing - you may request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will tell them about this request where possible.
right to object to processing - you may request that we stop processing your personal data at any time and we will do so to the extent required by the GDPR.
rights related to autonomous decision making, including profiling – you have a right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, except where such automated decision making is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract with you, is authorised by applicable laws or is based on your explicit consent.
right to data portability - you may obtain your personal data from us that you have consented to give us or that is necessary to perform a contract with you. We will provide this personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format to enable data portability to another data controller. Where technically feasible, and at your request, we will transmit your personal data directly to another data controller.
the right to complain to a supervisory authority - you can report any concerns you have about our privacy practices to the relevant data protection supervisory authority.
Where personal data is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing, including profiling related to direct marketing.
If you would like to exercise any of your above rights, please contact us at marketing@staah.com. If you are not satisfied by the way your query is dealt with by our data protection officer, you may refer your query to your local data protection supervisory authority e.g. in the United Kingdom, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office.

The Account and Marketing Data may be transferred to, and stored in, a country operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
