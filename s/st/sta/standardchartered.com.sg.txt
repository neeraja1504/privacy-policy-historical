SECURITY
Personal data may be transferred to, or stored at, a location outside of your country of residence, which may not have data protection law. The security of your personal data is important to us. SCB has technical and organisational security measures in place to safeguard your personal data. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to security standards mandated by SCB. We may do this through contractual provisions, including any approved by a privacy regulator, and oversight of the service provider. Regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is kept securely.
You should be aware that the Internet is not a secure form of communication and you must not send us any personal data over the Internet as this carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorised third parties. Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted internationally (even when sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than in your country of residence.
OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
There may be specific terms and conditions in our banking and product agreements that govern the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data. Such other terms and conditions must be read in conjunctions with this Privacy Statement.

AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND PROFILING
We will use profiling, including behavioural analysis, to assist us to provide you with better services, to make decisions and to prevent money laundering, terrorism, fraud and other financial crime, for example using profiling will help us to try and detect whether use of your credit card may be fraudulent. If any profiling will result in an automated decision relating to you, we will let you know and you will have the right to discuss the decision with us.
MARKETING
We will use your personal data:
* to conduct market research and surveys with the aim of improving our products and services;
* for marketing purposes, promotional events, competitions and lucky draws;
We process your personal data for these purposes because it is in the interest of our business to do so with the intention of improving our products and services and generating business. We will not send you marketing material if you have specifically asked us not to do so. You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing material at any time. To do so please contact your branch or relationship manager.
Clients with Relationship Managers, such as Private Banking and Priority clients of SCB, may from time to time be contacted by their relationship manager to discuss products and services designed to suit their investment objectives and/or interests.
If you change your mind and ask us not to send you marketing material or other promotional or research material you have subscribed to receive, we will need to retain a record that you have asked us not to do so to ensure that you do not receive anything further.
