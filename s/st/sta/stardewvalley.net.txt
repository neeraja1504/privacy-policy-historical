Stardew Valley - Privacy Policy
Effective Date: December 14, 2018
CONCERNEDAPE PRIVACY POLICY
ConcernedApe LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“ ** ConcernedApe ”, “ ** we ”, “ ** us ” and their derivatives) makes this policy available to users of our websites, including stardewvalley.net and its subdomains (collectively, the “ ** Websites ”), the Stardew Valley® videogame for PC, Playstation 4, PSVita, and Xbox (collectively, the “ ** Game ”), and other online services we may provide (with the Websites and the Game, collectively, the “ ** Services ”).
This policy describes our practices for collecting, using, transferring, disclosing, retaining and disposing of users’ personal data. Note that lowercase terms that are used but not defined in this policy ( e.g. , “personal data”, “controller”, “process”, “data subject”, etc.) have the meanings assigned in Article 4 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. To be clear, however, this policy applies to all users of the Services, no matter where they live.
This policy applies only to personal data we collect through the Services. It does not apply to any information that we collect offline or you provide to or is collected by any third party.
Please read this policy carefully, so you can understand our policies and practices regarding your personal data. If you don’t agree with our policies and practices, don’t use our Services. By using our Services—including by using our Websites—you agree to this policy.
Children
We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years of age. Our Services are directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, do not submit any information about yourself to us. If you become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at concernedape@stardewvalley.net, so we may remove the information.
Personal data we collect and how we collect it
Information from Third-Party Game Platforms. We may automatically receive your personal data from the third-party platform ( e.g. , Steam, the Playstation Store, etc.) (each a “ ** Third-Party Platform** ”) through which you download and play the Game. The personal data we collect from a Third-Party Platform may include, by way of example, your name, the name of your account associated with the Third-Party Platform, and a list of your saved contacts with the Third-Party Platform ( e.g. , your “Steam Friends List”). Personal data collected by a Third-Party Platform is subject to such Third-Party Platform’s privacy policy ( e.g. , the Steam Privacy Policy Agreement and the Playstation.com Privacy Policy). Information collected from Third-Party Platforms is used in accordance with the “How we use personal data” section below.
Correspondence. If you correspond with us electronically, we will retain records of our correspondence, including the contents of whatever was said, your email address, your name and any other information that you provide to us in such correspondence.
Analytics. If you browse our Websites, we may collect certain information about your use of our Websites. This information may include, without limitation, the number of page visits and duration, type of browser, etc. Some of this information, such as your IP address, may constitute personal data.
Data we collect about your use of the Websites may be collected through “cookies” and “web beacons”. Cookies are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer through your web browser that enable us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. Web beacons (also referred to as “clear gifs”, “pixel tags”, and “single-pixel gifs”) are small electronic files that enable us, for example, to count users who have visited our pages and for other related website statistics. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Additionally, other online resources, such as Privacy Badger from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, are available that can help block certain automatic data collection technologies. Please note that, if you disable or refuse cookies or other automatic data collection technologies such as web beacons, some aspects of the Services may be inaccessible or not function properly.
Where personal data is processed; transfer of personal data
We’re based in the State of Washington in the United States of America. We may process and transfer your personal data in and to the United States of America and other countries, regardless of where you are. Note that the laws regulating the collection, use, and disposal of personal data vary from country to country, so applicable law in the country where your personal data may be processed may not be as comprehensive or strict as the laws of the country where you’re located.
How we use personal data
If you reach out to us directly, we will use your personal data to respond to you. When you play the Game, we may use personal data collected from the applicable Third-Party Platform in order to present the Game and its various features and functions to you. Where you’ve provided information to us for a specific purpose ( e.g., to help us troubleshoot an issue you’re having with the Services), we’ll use your information in furtherance of that purpose. We do not use automated decision-making in connection with the processing of your information.
We use automatic data collection technologies and the personal data collected through them to enable our Websites to remember you. We also use information gained through automatic data collection technologies to compile statistical information about use of our Websites, such as the pages users visit most often. We may use this information to improve our Services.
Access to personal data by contractors and other third parties
We may give certain independent contractors access to data we collect, including personal data. These independent contractors may assist us with tracking use of our Websites and the provision and improvement of the Services. Independent contractors that work for us are obligated to keep personal data confidential and use it only in accordance with our express instructions. We are not responsible for the conduct of any of our independent contractors.
Google Analytics
One of our independent contractors is Google Analytics. Google Analytics tracks and reports website traffic and monitors use of our Websites. Data collected may be shared with other Google services and used to target the ads of its own advertising network. It is our understanding that you can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking on our Websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on that prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy Terms web page.
We also may disclose personal data:
to our subsidiaries and affiliates;
to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of ConcernedApe’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by ConcernedApe pertaining to the users of our Services is among the assets transferred;
To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, such as responding to a government or regulatory request;
