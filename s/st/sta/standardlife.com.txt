Cookie policy - Standard Life plc
This website uses cookies to help the performance of the website and your online experience.
A cookie is a piece of information that is saved to the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. It remembers information about the configuration of your computer or mobile device and will remember that you've visited before. This improves your website browsing experience by storing information so that you don't have to give it several times.
A cookie typically doesn't contain personal information, but other browsing details such as the domain from which the cookie has come from, a random unique identifier code and also the lifetime (expiry) of the cookie.
Cookies may be either "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie will remain valid and functional until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date); in contrast a session cookie will expire when the web browser is closed by the user.
