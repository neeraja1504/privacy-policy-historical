Personal Data We Collect
Sysoon collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Sysoon and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Sysoon’s Enterprise and Developer Products, please see the Enterprise and Developer section of this statement to learn how we process your data.
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.
How We Use Personal Data
Sysoon uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request;
Improve and develop our products;
Personalize our products and make recommendations; and
Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.
In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Sysoon products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
Reasons We Share Personal Data
We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Sysoon-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect Sysoon’s and its customers’ rights and property.
How to Access & Control Your Personal Data
You can also make choices about Sysoon's collection and use of your data. You can control your personal data that Sysoon has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Sysoon or using various tools we provide. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which products you use. For example, you can:
Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Sysoon by visiting our opt-out page.
Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Sysoon.
Access and clear your data through the Sysoon privacy dashboard.
Cookies & Similar Technologies
Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign-in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Sysoon apps use additional identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows described in the Windows section of this statement, for similar purposes.
We also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies from third-party service providers.
You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your Internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.
Products Provided by Your Organization–Notice to End Users
If you use an email address provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, to access Sysoon products, that organization can:
control and administer your Sysoon product account; and
access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, associated with your Sysoon product accounts.
If you lose access to your work or school account (in event of change of employment, for example), you may lose access to products and the content associated with those products, including those you acquired on your own behalf, if you used your work or school account to sign into such products.
Many Sysoon products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses. Please see Enterprise & Developer Products. If your organization provides you access to Sysoon products your use of the Sysoon products is subject to your organization's policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to your organization’s administrator. When you use social features in Sysoon products, other users in your network may see some of your activity. To Learn More about the social features and other functionality, please review documentation or help content specific to the Sysoon product. Sysoon is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.
Sysoon account
With a Sysoon account, you can sign into Sysoon products, as well as those of select Sysoon partners. Personal data associated with your Sysoon account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing into your Sysoon account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Sysoon account, and enables other features.
There are three types of Sysoon account:
Then you create your own Sysoon account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Sysoon account.
When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Sysoon account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account.
When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Sysoon account tied to your email address with your service provider’s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account.
If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Sysoon account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.

SSNX
SSNX is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Sysoon or others to control device settings, device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. For more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, go to https://www.sysoon.net. Legacy versions of SSNX (all versions) are subject to their own privacy statements.
