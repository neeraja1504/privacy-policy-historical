Legal basis includes consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary to fulfil contractual obligations (e.g. to provide you with the Services you have purchased)) and legitimate interest.

Security
Sysomos takes security of all data, especially your personal information, seriously. We have done our best to protect your information from any unauthorised access or loss with implemented security features and procedures. You should however be aware that the transmission of information via the Internet is never completely secure. You should also take necessary steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Transfers to countries that do not provide adequate level of protection
Sysomos is a global company and information that we collect from or about you within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may be transferred within our Group across international borders and to countries outside of the EEA that do not have laws providing an adequate level of data protection. We as the Data Controller (or Data Exporter) will do our best to ensure that your information is protected no matter where it is transferred to. To ensure adequate protection we utilise standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or rely on other legally-provided mechanisms to ensure the adequate protection of your information.

We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail or by completing the GDPR privacy request form.
