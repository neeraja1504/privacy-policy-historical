Syvum Privacy Policy
We at Syvum are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why Syvum has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information.
In general, you can visit syvum.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous.
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:
INFORMATION
We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company.
CHILDREN UNDER 13
Syvum does not collect any information from children under 13 that could identify them.
CHOICE
There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the syvum.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.
EMAIL
Syvum does not engage in or support spamming or misuse of email addresses.
We require your email address when you register as a member to our Teens or Individual Clubs (for ages > 13). Your email address is used once to send you a welcome notice. It is also used to regularly send you our newsletter or emails as a part of our mailing lists. It may also be used to send emergency emails, such as a major change to our service, or to send your password if you lose/forget it. If you take part in our contests, and are a winner, your prize notification will also be sent at that address.
Additionally, you may consent to receive information in the email on certain parts of our web site by simply providing us your email address.
When you use the "Send this page to a friend" feature on the Syvum web site, the email address of your friend is used only to send the requested page to them. No further emails are sent to that address, nor is that address revealed to any third party.
Your email address is held in strict confidence, and only used as stated here.
ACCURACY
We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.
SECURITY
We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Syvum may share aggregate information about its users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.
