Use of Cookies

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Synnex Australia Pty Ltd pages, or register with Synnex Australia Pty Ltd site or services, a cookie helps Synnex Australia Pty Ltd to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Synnex Australia Pty Ltd Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Synnex Australia Pty Ltd features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Synnex Australia Pty Ltd services or Web sites you visit.
