Tracking Technologies / Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this website. However, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires and is automatically deleted when you close your browser. When the user logs in to the website a new session cookie will be generated, which will store the user’s browsing information and will be active until the user leaves the website and closes the browser.
When the user restarts the browser and goes back to the website that had created the cookie, the website will not recognize the user. The user will have to log back in (if login is required). A session cookie tracks visitor behavior from page to page so the visitors don't get asked repeatedly for the same information they had already given to the website. Session cookies allow users to proceed through many pages of a website quickly and easily without having to authenticate or reprocess each new area they visit. We are not using the information stored in session cookies for any other purpose nor are these shared with third party tools or websites.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These files stay in one of the browser's subfolders until these are deleted manually or the browser deletes them based on the duration period specified within the persistent cookie. Persistent cookies help websites remember user information and settings when they visit them in the future. This results in faster and more convenient browsing during subsequent visits. Some of the features made possible by persistent cookies include: language selection, theme selection, menu preferences, and internal site bookmarks or favorites, among many others. We are not using the information stored in persistent cookies for any other purpose nor are these shared with third party tools or websites. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s "help" menu. If you configure your Internet browser to reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas of our website will be limited.
Web Beacons / Gifs
Third party tracking technologies on our website may employ a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons) that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We are using analytics programs such as Google® Analytics and Pardot™. We do not tie the information gathered by clear GIFs to our visitors’ personally identifiable information, except for IP address. This information is used only for analytical purpose.
Analytics / Log Files
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically through analytics programs such as Google Analytics and Pardot, and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users beyond their IP address, to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users’ movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Third Party Tracking
The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as Google Analytics and Pardot) on the website is not covered by our privacy policy. These third parties may use cookies, clear GIFs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our website. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our customers’ or users’ personally identifiable information.
Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting
We may partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our website and to manage our advertising on other websites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information (except potentially IP address) about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here . Please note, this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Security
The security of your personal information is important to us. Syntel maintains the international Standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on "Information Technology – Security Techniques – Information Security Management System – Requirement." Organizations can choose to comply with this information security management system that contains managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures that are commensurate with the information assets being protected and with the nature of our business. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Additional Information
Links to Third Party Websites
Syntel may provide links to Internet websites maintained by others. Syntel is not responsible for the contents of, or any products or services offered in, those third party websites. You should be aware when you are leaving Syntel's website and be sure to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. Any links provided by Syntel to any third party website are provided to you as a convenience only. You should not infer that Syntel endorses or accepts responsibility for non-Syntel websites by the inclusion of any such links to those websites.
Blog / Forum
Our website may make message boards, forums, chat rooms, and/or news groups available to its users. Please understand that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. These areas shall be used in a noncommercial manner only. Except where expressly authorized by Syntel, you agree not to store or collect data about other users on our website.
Social Media Widgets
Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook® like button, links to our social media pages and widgets, such as the AddThis® button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Changes To This Policy
We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our privacy practices. If we make any material changes we may notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.
