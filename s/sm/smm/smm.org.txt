General Privacy Statement
The Science Museum of Minnesota is committed to its mission to "Turn on the science: Inspire learning. Inform policy. Improve lives." As an element of its operations in pursuit of that mission, the Science Museum routinely collects contact and other personal information from or about its constituents. The Science Museum recognizes and respects the need for privacy and security with information of this kind. The Science Museum is committed to following both the letter and the spirit of all laws governing its operations, including those pertaining to privacy and use of information.
The following privacy policy describes the Science Museum's current policies and practices with regard to information collected from and about its constituents. Unless otherwise indicated, all procedures apply to information collected online (via the Internet, World Wide Web, and email) and offline (via postal mail, telephone, fax, and in person). The collective term "constituents" is used to refer to Science Museum members, donors, website visitors, students, retail and rental customers, gift recipients for whom personal information is required, people who respond to offers sent by mail, people who request that information about the museum be sent to them, and all others from whom we collect information in order to provide requested services and products.

Donors

We do not share our membership, or donor information with any outside entities, except for companies that we must work with to conduct our business. When we do work with such companies (for example, ticketing or fundraising firms), we ensure that they comply with our data privacy and security policies. Certain aggregate data, which does not identify specific donors or their personal information, may be shared with funders, government organizations, and other groups (see below for details). The museum does not share its mailing or telephone lists with political candidates, parties or campaign organizations.

Notification of Changes to this Policy
To further its mission and better serve its constituents, the Science Museum is continually improving and adding new functionality and features to its website and improving and adding to its existing services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes and the changing nature of technology, the Science Museum's information practices will change from time to time.
If and when its information practices change, the Science Museum will post the policy changes to its website to notify its constituents of the changes and, where appropriate and practical, give them the opportunity to "opt-out" of the new programs and practices. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please check back at the Science Museum's website frequently or contact the Membership or Development Office; Computer Education Center students should contact the center directly.

Information Collected by the Museum
The Science Museum currently collects constituent contact information (such as street address, phone and fax numbers, and email address); transactional information (such as information collected in connection with the purchase of tickets, memberships and member programs, retail purchases, and class registrations); information collected in connection with newsletter and email subscriptions; and information about donations made to the museum. Additional information provided by the constituent—such as responses to survey information and information collected to fulfill requests for information about the Science Museum—may also be added to museum databases. The Science Museum supplements its databases with commercially available marketing information about individuals whose names are already in its databases.

Information Submitted by Third Parties
If, for example, a constituent purchases a gift certificate or reserves a ticket for someone else, or registers someone else for a class, the Science Museum collects not only the information the constituent provides about him or herself, but also the information the constituent provides about the other person. All of this information is subject to the practices within this policy. Gift memberships and class registrations are acknowledged by mail; advanced reservations are not. To inquire about information provided about you by someone else, please contact the Membership or Development Office); Computer Education Center students should contact the center directly.

This includes, for example, the information constituents provide when they purchase a membership or merchandise, register for a class, or complete a survey. In addition, our email newsletters and information updates often contain hyperlinks to additional information on our website and elsewhere on the web. The museum currently uses technology to track how often these links are used and which pages particular email subscribers choose to view.

Other Information Collected by the Museum Online
The Science Museum uses technology to collect a wide range of statistical information about the use of our website.

Children's Privacy on the Web
The Science Museum encourages families to visit the museum's website together as a shared activity, and the museum abides by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Currently, the only time the museum knowingly collects personal information through its website from children under 13 is when it receives requests from children to join a Science Museum educational mailing list. In order to register online for an educational mailing list, any visitor under age 13 is required to provide a valid email address for his or her parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian receives email notification with information about the educational mailing list as well as instructions on how to remove the child from the mailing list at any time. The Science Museum does not knowingly transfer the names of anyone under the age of 13 from its educational mailing lists to its general mailing lists.
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we do our best to delete any information we inadvertently collect from children under the age of 13 who visit our website as soon as we gain actual knowledge of its existence. If you learn or suspect that your child has provided personal information to the Science Museum during one of his or her visits to our website, please contact the Membership or Development Office or, if your child visited the Computer Education Center site, please call the center directly.
To learn more about how to protect your child's privacy on the web, please see "Social Networking Sites: A Parent's Guide" from the Bureau of Consumer Protection at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec13.shtm.

Sharing of Information
The Science Museum of Minnesota is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our patrons. We do not share our patron, membership, or donor information with any outside entities, except for companies that we must work with to conduct our business. When we do work with such companies (for example, ticketing or fundraising firms), we ensure that they comply with our data privacy and security policies. Certain aggregate data, which does not identify specific patrons or their personal information, may be shared with funders, government organizations, and other groups (see below for details).
The museum does not share its mailing or telephone lists with political candidates, parties or campaign organizations.
The Science Museum currently shares aggregate information, such as attendance figures, marketing and fundraising response rates, online session data, and group demographics with other museums, sponsors, and other organizations. This information does not personally identify any of the museum's constituents.
In addition, there may be some limited circumstances in which the Science Museum may share or transfer the information in its databases. Examples include to respond to judicial process; to comply with state, federal or local laws; to protect the security or integrity of its databases or its website; to take precautions against liability; in the event of a corporate reorganization; or to provide information to law enforcement agencies to the extent required by law.
The Science Museum collects and maintains in its databases the names and postal addresses of many constituents.

Email Correspondence, Newsletters, and Informational Updates
The Science Museum of Minnesota does not share constituent email addresses with third parties and does not send unsolicited email. Email addresses provided to the museum are used for sending responses to questions and queries, providing purchase and registration confirmation, and communicating follow-up information. The museum also sends email newsletters and informational updates to those who request them. Constituents who receive email newsletters and updates may request to be removed from these lists at any time. Instructions on how to do so are provided within the message.

Reviewing Information
Upon request, the Science Museum does its best to provide constituents with access to their own unique identifier information (e.g. member ID number), contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, email address), and a description of other information that is maintained about them. The Science Museum does its best to correct any inaccuracies that are brought to its attention. Constituents who wish to review this information may contact the Membership or Development Office; Computer Education Center students should contact the center directly.

Third Party Mailing Lists
When the Science Museum uses mailing lists provided by other organizations, a qualified list broker or vendor administers the list on behalf of the Science Museum. The broker or vendor does not share information directly with the Science Museum. Rather, the broker or vendor uses the list to mail materials provided by the museum to the people on the mailing list. The broker or vendor then deletes the list from its database. The Science Museum therefore only has access to personal information from those who respond to a mailing. When it receives a request to be removed from a mailing list that is administered by a third party, the museum forwards this request to the third party, but the museum cannot ensure that names will be removed from third party lists.

Compliance with this Policy
The Science Museum of Minnesota is very sensitive to concerns regarding privacy of information.
