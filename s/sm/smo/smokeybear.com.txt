The Advertising Council, Inc. (“Ad Council”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) operates, hosts, and manages a number of websites, including without limitation,http://www.adcouncil.org, https://www.psacentral.org, and http://www.adlibbing.org (collectively, “Websites”).  Our Websites may also include the websites of our campaign sponsors where we host or manage the websites. This Privacy Policy describes,among other things, the types of information we collect, how we use it, and how we share the information.  Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use (“Terms”).
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT, ALONG WITH OUR TERMS, FORMS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT USE OUR WEBSITES.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We use the term “Personal Information” to refer to any information you provide in connection with your use of any of our Websites by which you can be personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information which might reasonably be used to identify you.  We obtain Personal Information from you when you submit it to us.  We may use your Personal Information to register or subscribe you for certain features, functions, services, activities, games, promotions and content on our Websites (these are referred to as “Content” in our Terms).  You may also email us with a question or for more information and we will use your contact information (which includes Personal Information such as an email address) to respond to your question or request.  If you provide or submit your Personal Information to any of our Websites, we will give you the right to review, update and/or delete your Personal Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal, regulatory our internal audit and record-keeping requirements.  We may also use your Personal Information to notify you of updates, promotional offers, or important information about our Websites and services.
As part of an SMS/text message service that we provide in connection with a particular campaign, we may collect your cell phone number, your carrier’s name, and the date, time and content of your messages, as well as other information that you provide. We may use this information to contact you and to provide the services you request from us.
When you access or visit any of our Websites, we and our operational service providers may use technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with your device.  Although the term “cookie” specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to our Websites.  This type of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit,data relating to activities on our Websites (e.g., so-called ‘click stream’ data) and other technological attributes about your visit to our Websites.  This information may be used by us, among other purposes, to analyze trends, administer our Websites, track user movements on our Websites, and gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve our Websites.
We may also use cookies on our Websites to recognize a user’s device each time it is used to visit a particular Website and to keep count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use our Websites, your preferences for features and functions and, for Websites that have registration or similar features, cookies can store information such as your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to visit.
You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from automatically accepting cookies.  Changing these settings may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use our Websites.
We or our advertising service providers also use data from companies, including Facebook through the Facebook company Atlas Solutions, to analyze certain information about your activities on our Websites and non-affiliated sites, such as pages visited and search key words entered, to help determine advertising content that may be of interest to you. This is also referred to as Online Behavioral Advertising (“OBA”).  You may choose not to participate in OBA by opting out through the tools provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) or by controlling the placement or reading of identifiers that track your data, resetting the identifiers, or, in some cases, deleting the existing cookies placed on your web browser. To opt out through the DAA, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices and opt out of online behavioral advertising by Facebook and other companies. When you choose to use these controls, an opt-out cookie will be placed on the browser you are using. If you use multiple devices or browsers you will need to opt-out on each one. If you choose to use a browser’s setting to delete cookies from that browser, you will delete any opt-out cookie associated with that browser and will need to opt-out again. Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It means that the companies from which you opted out will no longer customize ads based on data on your interests and web usage patterns.
You can opt out from receiving targeted advertising based on data collected via your mobile applications by following your mobile device maker’s most current published instructions, such as the examples below (current as of the date of this version of our Privacy Policy):

Our Websites and/or email communications will provide you with instructions and the procedures you can use to opt out when applicable.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California law permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding twelve calendar months.  At this time, we do not disclose your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes so this requirement does not apply to us.
