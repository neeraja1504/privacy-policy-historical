Welcome, and thank you for visiting Tigrani.co!
Tigrani  has taken great pride in the relationships that it has developed with its customers and friends. We do our best to ensure that your experience with us is one that you will want to repeat and share with your friends. Your privacy is very important to us, and Tigrani is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect.
This privacy policy is designed to answer any questions you may have about what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.
By accessing www.tigrani.co you are agreeing to all the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy described herein.
Personally Identifiable Information
When you register with Tigrani or purchase or use products or services from Tigrani, you provide us with information such as your name, postal address, e-mail, etc. Tigrani considers all this information “Personally Identifiable Information”. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information like screen names or other online aliases. When other personal information (such as consumer product preferences, sizes, etc.) is directly associated with your Personally Identifiable Information, this other information is also treated like Personally Identifiable Information. When you give Tigrani your Personally Identifiable Information, you are giving us your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth herein. We are always available to discuss your questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices. Please email us at privacy@tigrani.co.
The Information We Collect
Information You Provide To Us
In general, you can browse the Tigrani website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The Personally Identifiable Information we receive is provided directly by you so that Tigrani can provide the products and services that you have requested information about, or have ordered or purchased. Typically, this information includes your name, home, billing or other physical address, e-mail address and telephone number, as well as any information associated with the foregoing. In addition, we may also collect other types of information, such as information about your purchases, gender, credit card, etc., which we may associate with Personally Identifiable Information. For example, if you purchase products or services from us, we’ll note your credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. You may also provide us with photos, drawings or designs that may contain personal information. We may also collect personal information when you register with, log onto or visit the Tigrani website or our Facebook page (such as sweepstakes, contests, games, and informational and promotional offers), and when you provide information to our customer service representatives.
Information Collected By Technology
Tigrani also collects information through technology to improve your shopping experience with us, to make our website more interesting and useful to you, and for various purposes associated with our business. For instance, when you visit our site we collect your IP address (an IP address identifies the access point through which you enter the Internet, and is usually controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your company or your college). By itself, your IP does not identify you personally. Tigrani may use IP addresses to collect information about how often people visit various parts of our website, and we may combine IP addresses with Personally Identifiable Information if you open an account with us.
The Tigrani website collects information through a variety of technical methods, including cookies and Web beacons. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the site. Web beacons (also known as pixel gifs or action tags) are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. Cookies, Web beacons and other technical methods involve the transmission of information directly to Tigrani. Tigrani may use the information collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including enhancing your experience on our Web site. For example, when you return to our Web site after logging in, cookies allow the site to remember who you are. Tigrani also may use technical methods to analyze traffic patterns on our site, such as how often users visit various parts of the site, the Web site features that are most helpful to our customers, etc.
How Tigrani  Shares Your Personally Identifiable information
Except as set forth below, Tigrani never lends shares or sells its customer list or the Personally Identifiable Information of its customers to third parties.
How Your Personally Identifiable Information Is Used By  Tigrani
Personally Identifiable Information collected under this Privacy Policy is used by Tigrani for many purposes. For example, Tigrani may use your personal information to send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) offered by Tigrani. You may opt out of receiving these communications at any time.
Tigrani may also use your Personally Identifiable Information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials, which we call “Operational Uses.” For example, Tigrani may use your information to complete transactions you requested (such as your purchase of a product or service offered by Tigrani), or we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with credit card verification services to protect your credit card from unauthorized charges.
Finally, Tigrani may take your Personally Identifiable Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals, or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Tigrani to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information.
Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You
Sometimes Tigrani hires trusted third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes. These service providers may also help with payment processing, data storage/management, webhosting, web analytics, marketing, mailing, emailing, etc. Except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or to facilitate compliance with laws.
Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information
In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party (such as PayPal) may have authorized them to obtain your Personally Identifiable Information and to use that information in accordance with the third party’s own privacy practices and policies. Except as set forth herein, Tigrani will provide such companies only the information that you authorized.
Disclosures to Comply With Laws and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Tigrani, Our Web Site and Others

What Kinds Of Security Measures Does Tigrani  Take To Safeguard Your Personally Identifiable Information?
Your security and confidentiality, and the security and confidentiality of your Personally Identifiable Information are extremely important to us. Tigrani has implemented a combination of physical and electronic security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When Tigrani transfers sensitive personal information (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While Tigrani strives to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and, therefore, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us.         The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect guest information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
