This may include disclosure of such information to employees, representatives, officers, agents, affiliates, government and regulatory entities, third parties, and service providers. Such information and data will also be used to administer our business, the site, and our services in a manner consistent with this privacy statement, the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of this site and all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or other legal obligations.

Our affiliates are the family of companies controlled by Citigroup.

Aggregate Information
If you anonymously visit or browse the site without registering or logging on with a username, password or other registration code, we do not collect your personal information unless you disclose it to us (e.g., e-mail address). We may collect aggregate, technical information that tracks site use including browser type, IP address, domain name, number or type of pages visited and time spent on the site. We may use such information in a variety of ways including analyzing trends, visitor interests, or to improve the site.
Privacy Preferences
Your browser software may contain a feature intended to notify you of the cookie policies of the websites you visit. For example, the Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6 browser software contained in Microsoft® Windows® XP contains such a cookie- filtering device commonly known as P3P. General information about P3P can be found at www.w3.org/P3P. This site has attempted to be compatible with the P3P privacy-filtering tool. However, P3P is still an evolving standard and therefore, we are not responsible for any problems you may experience when using a P3P filter, or any discrepancies between the machine-coded privacy statements which are read by the P3P tool and our human readable policies that you see referenced here on this site including this privacy statement and the Citigroup  Privacy statement, which are the controlling documents to which you should refer if you have questions about privacy and this site.
Electronic Authentication
Collection and use of information about you for pattern recognition and other authentication procedures are part of the log on process for clients and guests registered to use the site. The process is intended to assess the authenticity of a request by registered users to access, transact business through, or otherwise use the site. A combination of multiple authentication elements about you such as your individual and user information, transactional data, session surveillance, device fingerprint, IP information, and pattern recognition may be collected and used by us in a manner that will generally be transparent to you during your sessions on the site. If the authentication elements do not meet our satisfaction at any time as determined by us in our sole discretion you may be required to pass through additional authentication assessments such as supplying specific answers to challenge questions or other procedures. We will collect and use information from or about you for such assessments, procedures and other administrative and business reasons as we may determine from time to time.
Online Advertising
Smith Barney online advertisements may be posted by other companies on third party sites that carry our advertising. These companies may set cookies and use related technology, such as encoded URLs or other tracking mechanisms that may note how Internet users respond to an online advertisement. For example, browsers that click on an online advertisement may be redirected to our site with an encoded URL or other tracking technology that may collect and store information about site visits, time spent, or a specific advertisement. Generally reported as aggregate and anonymous data, such information can help us understand for example the performance of online advertising. Third party sites that show our online advertising are often independent businesses that provide their own privacy statements. We are not responsible for such statements or sites. You should always review the privacy representations of those third party sites that you visit before you use them and particularly before you share personal information.

If you use other sections of this site that have additional privacy statements (e.g., My Accounts), those apply in addition to this statement to the use of that section or service as described.
