When a Kiz online or mobile product or service does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service will either block such users from the site, or will ensure that personal information is not collected from the child. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to us. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us.

When visitors come to our site, we passively collect certain computer information. We collect and then generate and store logs indicating Kiz website usage statistics.

Ad Serving Technology
Kiz websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile product or service and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may collect data for this purpose including IP address, geographic location, device ID's, information about your software, applications and hardware, browser information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The data described here may be used and disclosed in accordance with the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information collected or obtained from Kiz with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies

From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
