Limits On Our Abilities

Additionally, we may (and here you give us authorization to) disclose any private information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials, which we may believe to be necessary at our sole discretion or appropriate to address or to resolve inquiries or problems. We undertake that this will not be done for commercial purposes or for our personal gain.
Though SmartSMSSolutions maintains highest standard of privacy policy, this is independent of third party service provider(s) that may have access to user data such as but not limited to Internet Service Providers (ISP), international SMS Gateway and Routing Provider(s) and local mobile operators.
