Site Usage Information
Cookies
Like many websites and webapps, we use “cookies” to collect information.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration information for future logins to the Service.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how users interact with the Service or user Content, and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Service and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of, or have access to all functionality of, the Service.
Web beacons

Log data and behavioral tracking
When you interact with the Service, it automatically records information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or perform certain actions (“Log Data“). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you interacted with our Service, your actions, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical Administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our users’ needs. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information. These data is categorized as “Smarp’s data”, might be stored and processed by 3rd party service providers, and is not subject to datacenter geolocation requirement, if any, but can be anonymized upon request.

Third-Party Service Providers
We may employ agents, contractors, and third-party companies and individuals to operate the Service and perform related services (e.g., operation and maintenance of the Service, database management, web analytics, and improvement of the Service’s features), or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information and other information collected as set forth above only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose your Personal Information or use it for any other purpose.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Smarp, its suppliers, or other third parties, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.

Security
Smarp is ISO27001:2013 certified. We take security very seriously and have a dedicated Data Protection Officer (DPO), with clear and well implemented information security policies. Smarp uses commercially reasonable and industry standard safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting via the Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement, or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We restrict access to personal information to those employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. While Smarp endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to the Service, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
