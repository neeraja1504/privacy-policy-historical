Collected Information
We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services. At the time you express interest in obtaining additional information, or when you register for the service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as job title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the Site and editing their Personal Information within Setup. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their edits have been made.
SmartCompany uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations.

Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@smartcompany.net. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing support@smartcompany.net at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service.

This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Cookies
When you interact with the SmartCompany Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.
Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to SmartCompany, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 30-day Free Trial, you remain anonymous to SmartCompany. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.
SmartCompany uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows SmartCompany to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the SmartCompany application. SmartCompany uses persistent cookies, that only SmartCompany can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a SmartCompany customer or prior SmartCompany Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
