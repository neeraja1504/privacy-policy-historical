SCN gathers many pieces of information for use in fulfilling Member requests. This information includes, but is not limited to name, email address, phone number, postal address, billing address, IP address, time and date login information. This information is used to fulfill requests and allows our staff to better serve Members.
SCN also gathers information about how Members access and use SCN's services through smallcapnetwork.com, including how often and when Members visit the website, IP addresses, and the URL of the Member's last visit. This information is used solely for SCN's internal business purposes and will not be shared with any third parties.
The information that SCN collects is kept confidential unless otherwise specified. SCN uses third party advertisers who are interested in targeting our Members on behalf of their advertisers.
Registration Pages & Advertising
SCN collects Member information at the time of registration through Smallcapnetwork.com. This information is collected by SCN and stored on our secure web server.
SCN often offers selected offers from our partners as part of the registration process for certain sites, services, and products. These offers are designed to assist Members by providing them with valuable information, products, and services from partners who we believe will complement a Members interests. SCN in no way endorses the products or services of these advertisers. When a Member selects to receive one of our partner's offers, they are agreeing to receive information from that advertiser. As part of this advertising program, SCN will provide the advertiser with the required information required to fulfill the Members request. This includes, but is not limited to name, postal address, email address, and phone number.
Marketing Messages from Third Party Sponsors
SCN offers free subscription email newsletters via SmallCap Network.
Subscription requires Members to provide us with an email address and name at time of registration. Members may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. We operate in compliance with CAN-SPAM legislation, and maintain a "Do Not Mail" list of email addresses which will not receive future correspondence from SCN. Instructions for adding an email address to this "Do Not Mail" list are specified within email correspondence from SCN (with the exception of paid subscription newsletter issues).
Email addresses provided to SCN are kept on a secure server. SCN does however make available both email and postal information to select affiliates and advertisers. Email advertisers who wish to advertise to SCN's members are required to comply with CAN-SPAM legislation, and provide Members with an easy process of removing from future offers, as well as provide a "Do Not Mail" option for members who do not wish to receive any further communication from a specific advertiser. Members can elect to receive offers directly from SCN as well as sponsorship messages from our partners. Members can elect to discontinue receiving third party advertisements from SCN, while continuing to receive free newsletter content. SCN will not sell to third parties the personally identifiable information of our subscribers except in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of SCN's assets.
SCN does maintain a postal mailing list that is made available to approved advertisers who are offering financial-related products. SCN may share such postal information with such advertisers.
SCN does not control the practices of our advertisers. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad and go to their content, please contact them directly.

These individuals will not receive future emails from SCN, including free email newsletters, advertisements directly from SCN, or advertisements from third party advertisers sent on our behalf.
