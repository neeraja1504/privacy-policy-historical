Smart Bitches Trashy Books, LLC: Privacy Policy - Smart Bitches, Trashy Books
At SMART BITCHES TRASHY BOOKS, LLC (occasionally d/b/a Organization Academy) (“SBTB”), we value your trust and are committed to protecting your privacy by handling the personal information you provide us with care. To share our services with you and continually improve your experience on our websites, currently located at smartbitchestrashybooks.com and organizationacademy.com (collectively, the “Site”), we request certain personal information, as detailed below.  We created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to explain what information we collect from you when you access the Site and how we use and share that information. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us using the information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
General: All personally identifiable information collected by SBTB from the Site is used only by SBTB.  Aggregate reports of information may be shared with third parties such as advertisers, but no personally identifiable information is included in such reports.  Entities other than SBTB may collect personally identifiable information based on your use of the Site (see below), but none of that information is collected, processed, or controlled by SBTB.
Newsletter:  The newsletter list data is collected, stored, and managed by MailChimp. MailChimp’s privacy policy is located here. It is not ever sold to another third party or made available for sale. The information collected, such as your email address, is stored in order for SBTB to communicate directly with you. Upon registration for the newsletter, you will be asked to consent to the collection of personally identifiable information. The opportunity to unsubscribe is presented at the bottom of every newsletter you receive. Clicking on that link will remove you from the list, and your personally identifiable information will be deleted and no longer stored by SBTB.
Comments:  If you post a comment to an entry on the Site, you will be asked to enter a name, website URL (optional), and email address.  Once you post a comment, that name, website URL (if any), and email address, as well as the IP address, will be collected and stored on the Site, and the name and website URL (if any) will be visible to other visitors to the Site.  SBTB will not use this information other than for purposes of comments on that particular post, unless that post contains a contest or giveaway. In the case of a contest or giveaway, SBTB may use the personally identifiable information contained in the comment to identify and contact the winner of the giveaway.  Information submitted in a comment will remain stored on the Site unless the particular post is deleted. By posting a comment, you consent to have your personally identifiable information collected and used as described in this paragraph.
Contests and Giveaways:  If you are the winner of a contest or giveaway, SBTB may contact you at the email address submitted in your comment, and may request shipping address information.  By providing that information, you are consenting to its collection, and to have the applicable contest or giveaway item mailed to you at such address, which may involve sharing that information with the applicable postal or shipping service. SBTB may store such information in an email archive, but will not otherwise use or distribute such information.
Ordering links: Please note that if you purchase a book or other item through a link on the Site, your purchase will be handled by the vendor you select (e.g., Amazon, Kobo, Nook, Apple, Google Play) and they may collect, process, and control their own separate information about you that is NOT shared with SBTB.  SBTB does not collect, process or control any such information.
Social Media: If you use a third-party connection, for example, through Facebook or Twitter by “following,” “liking,” SBTB pages, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service, but note that SBTB itself does not collect, process or control any of this information. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. before using them to link to other places.
