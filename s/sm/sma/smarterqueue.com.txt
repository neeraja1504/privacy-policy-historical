In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
If the Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data will be one of the transferred assets and the purchaser will be permitted to use the data for the purposes for which it was originally collected by us.
If we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers, or others (including exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).
If SmarterQueue sells, transfers or otherwise shares some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy, you will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information if it differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
6. Third Party Websites
Our Site contains links to and from other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies—they may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these websites or their policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
7. International Transfers
Information that we collect is stored, transferred between, and processed in multiple countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ). These countries include countries where we operate, countries where our servers are located, and countries where the third-party services that we use are based. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated as securely as it would be within the EEA and under the GDPR. Such steps may include our entering into contracts with any third parties we engage and the use of Commission-approved Model Contractual Clauses. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal data when it is transferred outside Europe (including a copy of the standard data protection clauses which we have entered into with recipients of your personal data) by contacting us as described in the Contact paragraph below.
8. Your Rights
8.1 Legitimate Bases
We will ensure that your personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently and that it will only be processed if at least one of the following bases applies:
You have given your clear consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose.
Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (or for us to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you).
Processing is necessary for our compliance with the law.
Processing is necessary to protect someone’s life.
Processing is necessary for us to perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority and the task/function has a clear basis in law.
Processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, except where there is a good reason to protect your personal data which overrides those legitimate interests, such as allowing us to effectively and efficiently manage and administer the operation of our business, maintaining compliance with internal policies and procedures, monitoring the use of our copyrighted materials, offering optimal, up-to-date security and obtaining further knowledge of current threats to network security in order to update our security.
8.2 Data Subject Rights
Under the GDPR, you have the right to:
Withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time. Please note, however, that we may still be entitled to process your personal data if we have another legitimate reason for doing so (such as to comply with a legal obligation).
Be informed of what data we hold and the purpose for processing the data, as a whole or in parts.
Be forgotten and, in some circumstances, have your data erased by ourselves and our affiliates (although this is not an absolute right and there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your personal data but we are legally entitled to retain it).
Correct or supplement any information we hold about you that is incorrect or incomplete.
Restrict processing of the information we hold about you (for example, so that inaccuracies may be corrected—but again, there may be circumstances where you ask us to restrict processing of your personal data but we are legally entitled to refuse that request).
Object to the processing of your data.
Obtain your data in a portable manner and reuse the information we hold about you.
Challenge any data we use for the purposes of automated decision-making and profiling (in certain circumstances—as above, there may be circumstances where you ask us to restrict our processing of your personal data but we are legally entitled to refuse that request).
Complain to a supervisory authority (e.g. the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the UK) if you think any of your rights have been infringed by us. (We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns, so please contact us prior to taking this step).
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will get your express opt-in consent before we use your data for such purposes or share your personal data with any third parties for such purposes, but you can exercise your right to prevent such processing by contacting us, or by unsubscribing using the links contained in the marketing emails.
You may revoke your consent for us to use your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy at any time by emailing us, and we will delete your data from our systems. To enforce any of the above rights, please contact us.
We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach of your personal data when we are legally required to do so.
