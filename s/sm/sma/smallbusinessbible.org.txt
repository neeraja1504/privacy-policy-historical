Getting the Money You Need to Succeed : Small Business Bible.org
Small Business Bible is dedicated to preserving the trust of our customers. This statement explains how we collect information and how we handle that information.
Information Requests
Small Business Bible offers a variety of resources for small business. To make full use of the resources on our site, we ask you to provide some basic information. When you sign up to receive Small Business Bible updates, you will be asked only for your e-mail address. If you wish to participate in other Small Business Bible services you will be asked to register. At this time you will be required to choose a username and password, and provide an e-mail address so that you can use the personalized features on our site. Other information can be provided but it is optional and only used for demographic purposes.
Promotions
We may use your registration information to send you promotional materials and updates on the site. If you decide you would rather not receive such material you may opt out of receiving promotional material or you can use the opt-out function to have your registration information removed from Small Business Bible’s database altogether.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that most Web sites, including Small Business Bible, place on your computer. Cookies help us identify your interests. They also prevent you from having to register repeatedly on Small Business Bible.
Cookies delivered to you through banner ads are collected by our advertisers. We do not have access to any specific information they may provide. The banner ads on our site only provide us with comprehensive information. No individual information is given to us. Small Business Bible is not able, and does not wish, to use cookies to track your activities online outside of our site. No cookie delivered by us will interfere with the operation of your computer.
Shared Information
You should review the privacy policies of our service provider sites to confirm the way they handle their users' information because it can be vastly different from that of Small Business Bible. While we do not sell customer information, there are some sites that will.
There may be instances where it is necessary to share information with service providers, this will be expressly noted at the time you provide the information and a link to the service provider’s privacy policy will be provided for your review prior to submission. The use of this information by that partner will then be subject to the partner's privacy policies.
Small Business Bible may share information gathered from its customers, in aggregate form, with others such as advertisers or sponsors.
General Considerations
Small Business Bible cannot guarantee that the information you provide to us is completely safe, although we are careful to try to prevent problems. There may be technical problems beyond our control that may make it accessible to unauthorized persons. There may also be visitors to the site who gather and use information available in public areas.
There may be occasions on which Small Business Bible is required to provide information by order of a court or when the law requires that user information be treated as a transferable asset, as in bankruptcy.
Internet-based commerce is dynamic and changing. We may revise our privacy policy in the future to adjust to such changes. We recommend that you check it frequently.
If you have questions or comments on this Privacy Statement, please contact us.
