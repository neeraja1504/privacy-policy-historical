The Service - The SmartShopper browser add-on is designed to help you compare products and prices while you shop online.

Alternative prices and other product information will then be displayed in a browser side bar.
Limited List - SmartShopper maintains a limited list of pre-examined domains determined by our professional team to be eCommerce or travel related. The list updates from time to time. The browser add-on becomes active only when visiting such domains or when manually triggered by you.

Non Personal Information - All data transferred to our servers by the browser add-on is anonymous and does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, like email, name, address etc.
