The following document discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for  www.newgistics.com  (collectively, the "Site").

What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information
Newgistics is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. This Site does not collect personally identifying information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. However, we do collect information from you in the following ways:
Use of IP Addresses
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in improving the Site, and to deliver content that is customized and personalized. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Security
This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All of your personal information is stored in computers at a 24 hour guarded facility behind a secure, multi-layer firewall that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Newgistics. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your private information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

Except as expressly stated in this Privacy Policy, Newgistics will not sell, share or rent personally identifiable information to any other companies.

If a child submits information to us through any part of our Site, and we know that the user submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.
Exception to Privacy Policy
Newgistics will provide personally identifying information about users when required by law or governmental authority including, without limitation, under request of subpoena.
