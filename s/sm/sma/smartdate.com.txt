In addition, we collect information about your specific requests, comments and suggestions. We may also collect the information you disclose in any of our chat rooms, discussion groups and bulletin boards, when they become available.
Use of our site might require that you accept the use of cookies, which are small data files that our Web site might send to your browser for storage on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies to protect confidential data, track activity at our site and better serve your needs and interests.
We use your personally identifying information to identify you as a user of the site and to respond to your inquiries, identify market trends and formulate business plans. If you grant us permission to contact you about our products and services, we may use your email address to contact you directly regarding services or products that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also associate your personally identifying information with information we collect about your preferences and activities at the site, such as the particular pages you request at the site and purchases or other transactions you effect through or based on information on the site. We may vary the content you receive in future visits to the site based on your preferences and activities.
We may combine your personally identifying information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through or based on our site in a particular geographic region.

Such collective profiles may also be disclosed in describing our site and services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
Finally, we may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm.
We will request your permission to send your personally identifying information to others, and if you do not grant such permission we will restrict the use of your information to maintaining your use of the site.
