SmartWeb Shopping the smart way
This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by SmartWeb Software Ltd.
SmartWeb is an application designed to help you compare products and prices while you shop online.
SmartWeb is activated only on sites that are listed in our white list. This sites list is updated from time to time.
When you visit a website from our white list, SmartWeb detects the product you are looking for and automatically searches thousands of vendors for more deals and better price. Alternative prices and other product information will then be displayed in a slider window on the screen.
When you get to one of the sites in that list, SmartWeb application sends the product information you are looking for to our servers in order to search for alternatives deals.
All data sent to our servers by the SmartWeb application is anonymous and does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, like email, name, address etc.
The information sent to our servers is anonymous and may include the IP address, the URL of the web site you are visiting, a general information about your browser and operating system, a product information as taken from the product HTML page and unique identifier of your SmartWeb application.
SmartWeb works with third-party content providers to serve comparative offers. We share the anonymous information with such companies in order to retrieve and present alternative product pricing and information. SmartWeb does not place any restrictions on usage of this anonymous information by its third-party partners.
We do not share any Personally Identifiable Information with any third parties, except if it's required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
