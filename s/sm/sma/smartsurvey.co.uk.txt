The information SmartSurvey collects about Survey Respondents
Survey responses: On the instructions of the Account Holder, we collect your survey responses on their behalf. We then store those survey responses for the Account Holder. If you would like your survey responses erased, rectified, accessed or for any other queries about your responses, please contact the Account Holder directly.
Please bear in mind that not all surveys are anonymous and some Account Holders may ask you to put in your personal data.
Information which the Account Holder has shared with us for the purposes of administering the survey: Sometimes Account Holders list their Survey Respondents for us to contact to take the survey, or to ensure that certain data is not duplicated by the same Survey Respondent. Because of this you may find that the Account Holder has shared your email address so that we can contact you about responding to the survey, or has allowed for your IP address to be recorded and linked to your survey responses when you complete the survey responses. Please contact the Account Holder for further help on this issue.
SmartSurvey’s Use of the information we collect about you
We do not use your survey responses other than carrying out the service for the Account Holder. Your survey responses are owned and managed by the Account Holder who will have its own policy on data handling and would decide on whether your survey responses are kept private, disclosed to third parties, or provided to the public.
We do however employ a high standard of security, so if the Account Holder keeps your survey responses private, it will be stored in a highly secured environment – for more information please see our security section below and our security policy.
We do not sell your survey data to other parties nor do we store it to contact you for a purpose other than under the direction of Account Holder.
We only share your data with third parties if necessary to carry out the service(s) that the Account Holder has requested and as mentioned in this Privacy Policy & Notice.
If an Account Holder does not select the “Anonymous Survey” feature, then your IP address will be stored along with your responses.
Your rights to the personal data we process on behalf of the Account Holder
If you want to access your personal data, rectify your personal data, erase your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or for any other enquiries regarding the handling of your personal data, please contact the Account Holder directly. The Account Holder is able to amend, erase and access all the survey data and responses from its account.
If you believe that the Account Holder is not complying with its legal obligation(s) regarding your personal data, please contact our legal team for a resolution: legal@smartsurvey.co.uk.
You can opt out of receiving survey requests by contacting the Account Holder directly. Alternatively, you can also click on the link supplied in an invitation email to opt out of receiving survey requests.
Data Retention
Please note that as the Account Holders control their own survey data, if you are a Survey Respondent to an Account Holder’s survey you will need to contact them directly to amend or delete anything in your survey responses.

Part 2: Privacy of Survey Respondents
A “Survey Respondent” is anyone who fills out a survey powered by SmartSurvey.
The information SmartSurvey collects about Survey Respondents
Survey responses: On the instructions of the Account Holder, we collect your survey responses on their behalf. We then store those survey responses for the Account Holder. If you would like your survey responses erased, rectified, accessed or for any other queries about your responses, please contact the Account Holder directly. Please bear in mind that not all surveys are anonymous and some Account Holders may ask you to put in your personal data.
Information which the Account Holder has shared with us for the purposes of administering the survey: Sometimes Account Holders list their Survey Respondents for us to contact to take the survey, or to ensure that certain data is not duplicated by the same Survey Respondent. Because of this you may find that the Account Holder has shared your email address so that we can contact you about responding to the survey, or has allowed for your IP address to be recorded and linked to your survey responses when you complete the survey responses. Please contact the Account Holder for further help on this issue.
SmartSurvey’s Use of the information we collect about you
We do not use your survey responses other than carrying out the service for the Account Holder. Your survey responses are owned and managed by the Account Holder who will have its own policy on data handling and would decide on whether your survey responses are kept private, disclosed to third parties, or provided to the public.
We do however employ a high standard of security, so if the Account Holder keeps your survey responses private, it will be stored in a highly secured environment – for more information please see our security section below and our security policy.
We do not sell your survey data to other parties nor do we store it to contact you for a purpose other than under the direction of Account Holder.
We only share your data with third parties if necessary to carry out the service(s) that the Account Holder has requested and as mentioned in this Privacy Policy & Notice.
If an Account Holder does not select the “Anonymous Survey” feature, then your IP address will be stored along with your responses.
Your rights to the data we process on behalf of the Account Holder
If you want to access your data, rectify your data, erase your data, object to the processing of your data, or for any other enquiries regarding the handling of your data, please contact the Account Holder directly. The Account Holder is able to amend, erase and access all the survey data and responses from its account.
If you believe that the Account Holder is not complying with its legal obligation(s) regarding your data, please contact our legal team for a resolution: hah@smartsurvey.co.uk.
You can opt out of receiving survey requests by contacting the Account Holder directly. Alternatively you can also click on the link supplied in an invitation email to opt out of receiving survey requests.
Data Retention
Please note that as the Account Holders control their own survey data, if you are a Survey Respondent to an Account Holder’s survey you will need to contact them directly to amend or delete anything in your survey responses.
