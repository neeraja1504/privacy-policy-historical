Any transfer of personal data to state institutions and authorities will take place only as required by national legislation.
Small Improvements will send a welcome email, as well as emails regarding the status of a person’s performance review, 360 degree reviews, objectives etc. All emails may be disabled by either the recipient in their settings page, or company-wide by the system’s administrators. Administrators will at times receive Small Improvements product related announcements in order to inform about upcoming changes.

This data is collected and processed only to the extent required by law. As far as further data may not be required directly for the execution of the contractual relationship, the processing is based on a legitimate interest of the company according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, such as direct marketing or improving customer loyalty or customer support.
In individual cases, we may also obtain your consent (Art. 6 (1) a; Art. 7 GDPR) in the processing or transmission of your data. Your consent in these cases is voluntary and unless otherwise agreed, may be rescinded for the future at any time.
