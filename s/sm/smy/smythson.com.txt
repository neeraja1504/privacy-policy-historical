• Your contact information, e.g name, address, telephone number and email address,

Cookies
To improve your experience with us, our website uses cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a piece of data that our website automatically transfers to the hard drive of your computer or mobile device when you access the website and is used to:
• Access stored information when you log in,
• Carry information from page to page of our website,
• Store site preferences and the items in your shopping basket,
• Identify whether you have visited our website previously,
• Monitor the number of visits that you make to our website, where you browse and what you have purchased, and to offer you tailored content.
Your browser options allow you to disable cookies. You should note that if you do disable cookies, you may not be able to access all the services on this site. By continuing to use the site, you are accepting our use of cookies on our site.
Web beacons work in a similar way to cookies and allow us to monitor the behaviour of our site users.
The following data may be automatically collected every time you visit the website regardless of whether you are logged in: computer and connection information, browser information, operating system and platform details and time of access. We may use an IP address to identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you, which we will use to assist in the detection of fraud, to help identify problems, to administer the website and for marketing purposes.
If you have provided us with an email address, we will be able to associate this email address back to your previous browsing and purchase experiences. If you log in, then in addition, we will be able to associate your log in with your billing addresses, delivery addresses and your payment details.
To prevent and detect fraud, we may also obtain details of your credit history from credit reference agencies.
What is your information used for?
The main purposes for which we collect and store your personal information are as follows:
• Order processing
• Delivery of products
• Payment authorisation and billing
• Promoting our offers and products
• Improving the website and our service to you
We will contact you with marketing information where relevant if you have opted to receive such communications. By registering on our site, you consent to the addition of your details to our email and postal (including catalogue) distribution list unless you have previously opted out. You may opt out of our communications at any time, although it may take a short time for any changes to become effective. Logging in will give you access to your account options where you can update your details.
Use of your information by third parties
We will not sell your personal information to third parties. However, we do share customer and browsing information with third parties as described below. By making a purchase on the website, you consent to Smythson sharing your personal information with third parties as is necessary to process your order, for example, to banks, credit card companies and carriers.

We may form contracts with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, name and address verification, database management profiling and segmentation, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Smythson.
To protect against the fraudulent use of credit cards, we carry out security checks on orders. These can take various forms, and may involve contacting you by telephone before your order is processed.
Smythson may disclose your personal information if necessary to comply with regulations or law or to assist with law enforcement, to enforce the terms under which you trade with us, to protect our property and other rights.
Our website may contain links to third parties’ websites. Smythson assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of those websites.
