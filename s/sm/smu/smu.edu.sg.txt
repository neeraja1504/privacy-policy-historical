SMU Personal Data Protection Statement
Applicable to non-EU Data Subjects only. For GDPR Privacy Statement applicable to EU Data Subjects, please click here .
SMU respects the privacy of individuals and recognizes the importance of the personal data you have entrusted to us and believe that it is our responsibility to properly manage, protect, process and disclose your personal data. We are also committed to adhering to the provisions and principles of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. As such, this Personal Data Protection Statement is to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and/or disclose your personal data.
We will collect, use and disclose your personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“Act”). The Act establishes a data protection law that comprises various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. It recognises both the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction, and the needs of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes.
“Personal data” is defined in the Act as “data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified – a) from that data; or b) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.”
The Act takes into account the following concepts:
Consent – Organisations may collect, use or disclose personal data only with the individual's knowledge and consent (with some exceptions);
Purpose – Organisations may collect, use or disclose personal data in an appropriate manner for the circumstances, and only if they have informed the individual of purposes for the collection, use or disclosure; and
Reasonableness – Organisations may collect, use or disclose personal data only for purposes that would be considered appropriate to a reasonable person in the given circumstances.
In projecting the three main concepts above, the Act contains nine main obligations which organisations are expected to comply with if they undertake activities related to the collection, use and/or disclosure of personal data:-
The Consent Obligation
(2) The Purpose Limiting Obligation
(3) The Notification Obligation
(4) The Access and Correction Obligation
(5) The Accuracy Obligation
(6) The Protection Obligation
(7) The Retention Limitation Obligation
(8) The Transfer Limitation Obligation
(9) The Openness Obligation
While we will not be going into the details of these Obligations in this Personal Data Protection Statement, you can be rest assured that we are constantly mindful of them in our collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Should you wish to know more about these obligations, an excellent summary can be found in the Advisory Guidelines of the Personal Data Protection Commission at:

Naturally, in encouraging a vibrant interaction with the public, there will be opportunity, and often a need, to collect, use and/or disclose personal data from members of the public. Some of the reasons/ purposes are as follows:
For security/ verification purposes for certain Events
For logistical/ administrative purposes for certain Events (eg. Food catering)
To keep you updated of future SMU Events/ products which we feel may interest you

In almost all of the above situations, it will be totally up to you as to whether, and to what extent, you wish to provide us with your personal data. For Events where such provision of personal data is a pre-requisite to attendance, you shall be informed in advance so that you may make an informed decision as to whether to attend. SMU will also endeavour at all times to inform you of the purposes for which personal data collected from you will be used. Should you at any time feel that the manner in which SMU has acted, or seeks to act, in respect of the collection, use or disclosure of personal data for an Event is inappropriate, please feel free to make your concerns known to the Data Protection Officer, whose contact details can be found at http://www.smu.edu.sg/form/contact-dpo

In this respect, please note that we may disclose your personal data to third parties in certain circumstances without first seeking your consent, if such disclosure is either required or permitted under the Act, including without limitation, if the disclosure is required by law and/or regulations or if there is an emergency.
3. Request for Access, Correction and/or Withdrawal of Personal Data
Subject to certain exceptions in the Act, you may request to access and/or correct the personal data currently in our possession or withdraw your consent for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data in our possession at any time by clicking here.
For a request to access personal data, we will provide you with the relevant personal data within a reasonable time from such request being made. You may be charged a reasonable fee for the handling and processing of your requests to access your personal data, but you will be notified in advance of such fees.
For a request to correct personal data, we will process your request, including undertaking necessary verification activities, as soon as practicable after the request has been made. We will send the corrected personal data to every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed by SMU within a year before the date the correction was made, unless that other organisation does not need the corrected personal data for any legal or business purpose, or if you so consent, only to specific organisations to which the personal data was disclosed by us within a year before the date the correction was made.
For a request to withdraw consent, we will process your request within a reasonable time from such a request being made, upon informing you of the consequences of your request for withdrawal of consent.

Appropriate security arrangements will be taken to prevent any unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, leakage, loss, damage and/or alteration of your personal data.
We will also take reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal data in our possession or under our control is destroyed as soon as it is reasonable to assume that (i) the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by the retention of such personal data; and (ii) retention is no longer necessary for any other legal or business purposes.
Our websites may contain links to other websites not maintained by SMU. Such third party websites are subject to their own data protection and privacy practices and you are encouraged to examine the data protection policies of those websites.
5. Responsibility of EMPLOYEES (Staff, Faculty), STUDENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
The Act also imposes certain responsibilities on all those who process personal data at the University, whether you are a member of staff holding, using and sharing personal data in your teaching, research or administration, or a student accessing and recording personal data in your studies or other activities. These obligations include holding and using data in a secure manner, making sure that data is handled in line with what individuals have been told, having appropriate arrangements in place for the access to (and sharing of) data, and making sure that individuals' data is accurate and retained for a suitable period. If a data breach occurs (e.g. personal data held by the University is lost, stolen, inadvertently disclosed to an external party, or accidentally published), this should be reported immediately to your seniors and the Data Protection Officer so that we may review the circumstances and liaise as necessary with colleagues internally and the relevant external authorities.

5. Data privacy impact assessment (“DPIA”)
Where processing is likely to result in a high risk to an individual’s data protection rights (e.g. where SMU is planning to use a new form of technology), we will, before commencing the processing, carry out a DPIA to assess:

8.1.5 to restrict the processing of personal data where the accuracy of the information is contested, or the processing is unlawful (but the EU Data Subject does not want the data to be erased), or where SMU no longer needs the personal data but the EU Data Subject requires the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; and
8.1.6 to object to the processing of personal data based on the legal basis stated in paragraph 3.1.1 (e) or (f) unless SMU demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the EU Data Subject’s interests or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
