How you can change the information
This policy addresses our practices with respect to our website, but does not address the practices of any website we link to (including the merchants and content providers we link to). This policy is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, our User Agreement.
How We Use Information collected
We use information which you provide us to keep track of the SMSLive247 services you have signed up to receive.
