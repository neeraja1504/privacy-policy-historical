Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.

Other cookies we use are in relation to marketing performance. These cookies, such as Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Hotjar, Facebook, LinkedIn, Outbrain, Twitter and Hubspot help us to understand how users interact with our site, doing so anonymously by placing users completing the same actions into an audience “bucket”. These cookies report back to our systems about the pages users have visited or the actions they have completed. The reason for this is so that we are better equipped to provide a more appropriate marketing strategy for our potential customers. For example, by supporting a popular page with a link straight from the homepage to increase satisfied browsers.
We also utilise remarketing products with the information collected from these cookies. For example, Google allows us to build an anonymous audience list based on a user’s action i.e. visited the site, which we can then use as a target audience to display advertising to across Google’s display network of content websites.

Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard strong encryption – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door.
Users of the SMSGlobal Messaging Service must realise that although SMSGlobal employs high levels of security, no data transmission over the internet can be 100% safe.
Therefore, use of SMSGlobal’s Messaging is at the client’s own risk.
Furthermore, users must be aware that sending messages with SMSGlobal will have a similar level of security and reliability as that of Mobile Phone Networks.
SMSGlobal, its employees and contractors will not be held liable for any loss or damage whatsoever, incurred through the use of SMSGlobal SMS Messaging, including loss of information due to carrier failure, network failure or negligence on the part of SMSGlobal, its employees or contractors.
Please refer to our Terms and Conditions and Disclaimer for more information.
