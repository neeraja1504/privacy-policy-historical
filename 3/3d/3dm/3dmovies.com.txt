3DMOVIES.COM®  PRIVACY POLICY
Last Revised: December 11, 2008
3DMOVIES.COM, LLC. ("3DMOVIES.COM") is concerned about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how it collects, uses and shares your information. 3DMOVIES.COM has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 3DMOVIES.COM collects some or all of the following information whenever you sign up for or use the various 3DMOVIES.COM services and products, including without limitation the 3DMOVIES.COM Web site, the 3dxs.com Web site, any other Web site owned or operated by 3DMOVIES.COM (each a "Site"), online mobile service, and telephone service, and/or purchase movie or other event tickets, or other products or services offered by 3DMOVIES.COM, 3dxs.com, or any affiliate (collectively, the "Service"). Some of this information is collected automatically and some is collected only when you provide it voluntarily.
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN
3DMOVIES.COM is not designed or intended for use by children under 13. If you are under 18, you should use 3DMOVIES.COM only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
ANTI-SPAM POLICY
3DMOVIES.COM is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam"). We do not have any desire to send unsolicited marketing emails to anyone without permission and we do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party in violation of this Privacy Policy. If you receive any unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that 3DMOVIES.COM did not provide your email address to such parties.
This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. Unfortunately, spammers obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones. Please be assured that at 3DMOVIES.COM we hate spam as much as you do, and we do our best to avoid contributing to it.
All of our newsletters and other general email marketing communications also include an "unsubscribe" opt-out link that you may use to ask that we discontinue such emails to you. (Even if you opt-out of our newsletter or other marketing communications, we may still send you certain transactional or administrative emails, such as email confirmations of ticket purchases, or emails regarding changes to your account.)
All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please contact us and we will investigate. Please be assured that we strive not to contact anyone for marketing purposes without permission, and if you prefer not to receive any further marketing communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.
