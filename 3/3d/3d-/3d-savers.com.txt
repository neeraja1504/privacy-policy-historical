3D Savers
3D Savers takes your privacy as seriously as you do. We understand that you want to control your personal information, whether it concerns demographics or preferences. 3D Savers is committed to the responsible management of consumer information and abides by all rules, both ethical and legal, with respect to the use of consumer information. We strictly adhere to all established industry guidelines, and are continuously monitoring and enhancing how we manage the use and security of your personal information to uphold your rights. 3D Savers's Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest quality of service with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our users. This statement will be continually assessed against new technologies and business practices.
The Use of Information
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your electronic referrals. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them. We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.
We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. Agents and contractors of 3D Savers who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for 3D Savers. 3D Savers will not disclose personally identifiable information to companies not owned by us who want to market products or services to you without your prior permission.
