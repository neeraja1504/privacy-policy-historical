Fraud
A number of banking organisations and their customers has been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers.

To date the occurrence of such online fraud has not been extensive. The Bank of Ireland Mobile Tablet Banking Apps will only ever be available to download from the Apple App Store or Google Play. However, always be cautious of disclosing your personal details.
We only request your personal details if:
You initiate e-mail contact with us; or
You initiate a request for a particular service online and we require personal details to provide you with the requested service e.g. a loan or credit card application or other product information.
