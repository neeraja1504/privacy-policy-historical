Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At 9thandelm **  we have a few fundamental principles:**
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
In our Web site, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
9th and Elm Inc. d/b/a 9thandelm.com (“9thandelm.com”) operates the website http://www.9thandelm.com. It is 9thandelm.com’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, 9thandelm.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 9thandelm.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 9thandelm.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 9thandelm.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
9thandelm.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 9thandelm.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to 9thandelm.com’s websites choose to interact with 9thandelm.com in ways that require 9thandelm.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 9thandelm.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at 9thandelm.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 9thandelm.com– by submitting a request to a Service Provider, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those transactions. In each case, 9thandelm.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 9thandelm.com. 9thandelm.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

For instance, 9thandelm.com may monitor the most popular services on the 9thandelm.com site. 9thandelm.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
