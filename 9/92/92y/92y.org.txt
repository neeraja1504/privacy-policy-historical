Privacy Statement - 92nd Street Y - New York, NY
| Information Collected Voluntarily
92nd Street Y does not collect any personal information about individuals — such as names and postal or email addresses — except when such information is knowingly provided to 92nd Street Y. Personal information might be obtained from online transactions such as ticket purchases, event subscriptions, class registrations, memberships and donations. Additionally, personal information may be transmitted as part of a form submission or in connection with other activities or services made available on our site. Any personal identification information retrieved by 92nd Street Y must be voluntarily submitted by the user.

Information Collected Automatically
92nd Street Y website collects some anonymous information about users automatically when individuals request pages through a browser. This information is used to keep track of the shopping cart and to help us monitor how individuals use the site, allowing us to provide an optimal shopping experience and better service throughout the site. The information collected automatically by the Web server does not, however, contain anything that can identify individuals personally, such as an email address.

Security Statement
The 92nd Street Y makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on its website are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are encrypted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, which is the industry standard for information security and is used by more than 200,000 websites in over 50 countries.

What is a Secure Connection?
When a secure connection is established between your browser and a website, any data that is transferred over the connection will be encrypted to prevent it from being viewed by a third party. SSL encryption makes it very difficult for anyone to intercept or decode messages exchanged over this type of secure connection.
Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Netscape Browser display an image of a locked padlock in their status bar when connected to a secure site. Safari displays an image of a locked padlock in the upper right-hand corner. Firefox colors the address bar yellow when connected to a secure site. Secure transactions are also indicated when the prefix in the location bar of your browser switches from http:// to http s ://. The "s" stands for "secure." If you do not see the padlock at the bottom of your browser's window, if the padlock is unlocked, or if the protocol in the location bar is not listed as https://, then any data exchanged with the website is potentially visible to others.
Depending on your browser, you may be able to view authentication information about a secure page by double-clicking on the locked padlock in the status bar. For more information on how your software establishes a secure connection, see the help files for your particular browser.

Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can't read data from your hard disk or read cookie files that were created by other sites — the website that creates a cookie is the only one a browser will permit to access it.
Examples of ways in which 92nd Street Y might use cookies would be to control access to certain user features, such as your user password and membership profile, to customize content areas or to analyze site activity and user behavior. 92Y also reserves the right to use cookies in the future in conjunction with new content or extended functionality.
If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you can explore a web browser's options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or disallow cookies altogether. Users should be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies will restrict access to certain types of content or features, including the ability to process membership discounts online, to store items in a shopping cart and potentially to execute orders on our website.
