Last Updated: May 25, 2018

This privacy policy describes how Ebooks.com Pty Limited collects and uses the personally identifiable information you provide on our web site: www.ebooks.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.
eBooks.com respects your privacy. As we develop our online presence, we will revise our Privacy Policy to reflect our practices and to meet any legislative or other requirements. The terms of this Privacy Policy form part of and should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use and Licenses which govern this Website.
Collection of personally identifiable information
Ebooks.com Pty Limited is the sole owner of the information collected on eBooks.com. eBooks.com collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

From time to time, we may also request and you may choose to provide us with personally identifiable information through the use of the Website or through email addresses available from our Website.
If you do not provide us with the personally identifiable information that we request, we may not be able to properly assess your request for service and the level of service we can provide you may be reduced to the extent that you do not provide us with relevant information.
We will not collect sensitive information about you from anyone else without your consent.

Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personally identifiable information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, guarded environment.

eBooks.com acts as agent
In addition to operating as an online retailer of ebooks in its own right, eBooks.com also provides sales, fulfillment, payment processing and help-desk services to other companies on an agency basis. This service is most commonly provided to book publishers. We will make it clear to you whenever we are so acting as an agent, by showing the brand of the other company at the top of our web pages. The other company's brand will be followed by the words "Powered by eBooks.com" or similar. When we sell you an ebook in our capacity as agent, the vendor of record for that purchase will be the other company. When so acting as an agent, we may provide to the other company your personally identifiable information, so that they may continue to service your needs in the event that the partnership between eBooks.com and the other company ceases. If you opt-in to receive marketing information we may pass your information onto our partners, whom we act as agents, so they may continue that service. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with these companies, contact us at privacy@ebooks.com

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your visits to our website. A cookie is a small file that can be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use these to do a number of things:
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you visit our site.
Cookies help us to recognise when you next visit our website and note the recommendations displayed to you. This allows us to tailor the service we provide to your preferences.

What Are Cookies?
eBooks.com places tiny text files called cookies onto your computer, tablet or mobile device. This is standard practice for almost all websites.
Cookies are not harmful to your computer and are an essential part of online shopping. They allow us to give you a more efficient customer experience.
What Are Cookies Used For?
There are two main types of cookie; we call them "first party" and "third party" cookies.
First party cookies are small data files that we use for things such as keeping track of what you've put in your basket and remembering who you are when you return to our site. We don't save personal information such as credit card details in the cookies we create.
Third party cookies are set on our behalf. The most important of these are Google and Commission Junction, who display text or banner adverts on our behalf on a number of other reputable websites or in Internet search results. Commission Junction does not collect personal data from our website. Because our website uses Google Analytics to help us optimise our web pages and better understand the website’s traffic, if you visit us while you’re logged in to your Google account (like Gmail, for example) then some of your browsing activity on our site may be …
