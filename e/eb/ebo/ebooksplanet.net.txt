Your Privacy
We respect your privacy. We only use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a personalized shopping experience.
What information do we collect?
When you register as a Customer, you submit your name, email address and country. This information allows us to fulfill your orders and to contact you if the need arises. All customer information stored on our servers about you can be accessed or modified by you at any time by logging into My Account with your email address and password.
Will you disclose this Information?
No! Never! Your private information is too precious to share with anyone. Information gathered on this site is NEVER made available to third party vendors and NEVER sold to mailing list distributors.
Email Notifications
When you register as a Customer, you will receive an automated email containing your Customer Log In details.
When you purchase goods from us, you will receive an automated receipt by email. We only email you in person if we need to clarify details about your order or if we are responding to your questions or queries.
Email Communications and Newsletters
We send out occasional email newsletters to our customers. Our newsletters contain information about new products, special promotions, product updates, discounts and unique offers.
You have the option to unsubscribe any any time by logging into your Customer Account Area and updating your Newsletter Preferences.
Credit and Debit Card Information
As we use secure third party payment processors like PayPal to process credit card and debit card orders, we do not have any access to your credit card information at all.
When you make a purchase at this store, you are transferred to the secure servers of our payment processors. No credit card information is ever stored in our site database.
Cookie Usage, Security and Safe Shopping
This website uses cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do NOT contain any of your private information; they serve only to store items in your Shopping Basket or to recognize you as a registered Customer when you Log In or access your Account.
This prevents unauthorized users from accessing your private information.
We reserve the right to modify these policies for any reason at any time.
