This notice was last updated December 10, 2018, and will take effect immediately for new users and upon January 10, 2019 for all other users.
Welcome to ebaymainstreet.com!  At eBay we value your trust and strive to honor it by being transparent, consistent and reliable about how we use your Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated such that it can no longer be used to identify a specific person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise. We wrote this notice in simple terms so that you can understand how we handle your Personal Information.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
