1. The importance of the right to privacy.
Transat takes the privacy rights of individuals very seriously and, in this respect, takes all measures possible to ensure the protection of the personal information that we collect in providing our services. Transat may be required to exchange personal information with third parties on individuals for the purpose of administering customer accounts and files. Transat and such third parties may also exchange information on individuals that is not of a sensitive nature regarding their preferences for the purpose of offering and providing quality benefits, products, goods, and services in an efficient manner. Nevertheless, Transat will not collect, use, or disclose any personal information on an individual without his or her consent, unless compelled to do so by statute or regulation. In this regard, our primary concern is the trust that individuals place in our safeguarding the privacy of their personal information.
The purpose of this Policy is to outline our commitment regarding the protection of privacy as well as the rules we intend to follow when we collect, retain, use, or disclose personal information.
Our Policy has been formulated to satisfy and indeed, even to exceed the requirements of privacy legislation in force in Canada, specifically the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5, various provincial laws regarding privacy protection, the Principles set out in the National Standard of Canada for the Protection of Personal Information (CAN/CSA-Q830-96), as well as any applicable regulations (hereinafter the "Law"). We also undertake to constantly re-assess our rules of practice and our procedures in this area and to take into account the comments of any individuals.
In order to better understand and meet the expectations of individuals regarding the protection of personal information, Transat has designated a member of senior management to act as Director, Protection of Personal Information (hereinafter "the Director"). Any person may contact the Director in order to share comments, request access to any personal information that we may have on him or her, request that corrections be made to the information, or to file a complaint. The Director shall conduct a consistent review of Transat practices and procedures to ensure compliance with this Policy and to meet customer expectations in this respect.

Transat may use or disclose personal information solely for the purposes identified in advance and by employing the means also thus identified. Transat may not collect, use, or disclose any personal information concerning an individual without his or her express or tacit consent, as applicable, unless required to do so by statute or regulation.
Transat shall not use or disclose any personal information except for the following purposes, and in the manner indicated:
i.     Personal information, that is not sensitive in nature (N.B. information will be deemed as being sensitive of the purpose of applying the present Policy where such information refers to the health or physical, mental or medical condition of an individual), regarding customers' preferences, needs, and interests, may be used to identify those customers who are most likely to be interested in products or services offered by Transat and its agents, mandataries or representatives. Such information shall be used exclusively to enable Transat and its agents, mandataries or agents to propose services, premiums, benefits, and products that are likely to interest customers as part of a Transat promotional offer. Transat may not provide individualized customer profiles to third parties.
ii.     When a third party wishes to submit an offer to customers, generally the offer shall be sent to customers by Transat rather than by the party in question.
iii.     However, for follow-up purposes, Transat may on occasion provide a third party with a list of customers to whom an offer was transmitted. Occasionally, Transat may also provide such a party with a list of customers who meet certain general criteria involving non-sensitive information, while ensuring through contractual or other means that the third party is strictly prohibited from using the list for any purpose other than to offer customers a benefit or a privilege available exclusively to Transat customers.
The use of a customer list by a third party for any other purpose is forbidden. Information of a sensitive nature may not be disclosed under any circumstances without the express consent of the individual.
iv.     Personal information may be disclosed to agents, mandataries, representatives, or to other organizations whose services are retained by Transat.

They may not use the information transmitted to them except for the purposes referred to in the agreement. These parties are formally prohibited from disclosing the information in question to other third parties without the prior consent of Transat.
v.     Personal information may be disclosed when required by statute or regulation.
F.     Restrictions concerning the use, disclosure, and the retention of personal information
Transat may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than that for which it was collected, unless the express or tacit consent, as applicable, of the individual concerned has been obtained or unless the Law requires the use of disclosure of such information. Furthermore, Transat may not retain personal information except as required to achieve the purposes identified.
G.     Consent
Transat shall take all measures necessary to ensure that individuals know and understand the purposes for which it collects, uses, or discloses personal information. Transat shall obtain the consent of every individual in respect of whom it collects, uses, or discloses personal information. Indeed, depending on the circumstances and the nature of the information, such consent may be express or tacit. In certain circumstances, express consent is necessary. In other cases, consent is reasonably presumed, but is revocable on demand.

Transat shall use a combination of the aforementioned methods to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to contact the individuals concerned;
iii.     When customers fill out a survey from Transat, its agents, mandataries or representatives, concerning their preferences, needs, or interests, they will be advised of the specific reasons for which the personal information was collected, used, or disclosed. The survey shall contain a statement reminding the customer that in completing and returning the survey, he or she is consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of information provided through the survey for the purposes identified therein.
H.     Accuracy of personal information
Transat veillera à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour s'assurer que les renseignements personnels qu'elle détient au sujet des individus sont à jour et en fonction de l'usage auquel ils sont destinés.
i.     Transat shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to ensure that the personal information it has on individuals is up to date and accurately reflects its intended use.
ii.     Transat may not systematically update personal information unless it is necessary for achieving the purpose for which the information was collected. These updates shall be carried out in compliance with Section D above; and
iii.     Since it is quicker and more efficient for individuals to inform Transat of any changes to their personal information, such as their names or addresses, Transat shall ask the individuals concerned to ensure that the information they provide is up to date and accurate, and wherever possible, that they inform Transat of any changes.
I.     Measures for ensuring the security of personal information
Transat ensures the protection of personal information by relying on physical, technological, and administrative security measures.
i.     The security measures put in place by Transat are intended to protect personal information against loss or theft, and safeguard it from unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification;

When it uses information technologies such as the Internet, Transat shall remind individuals, agents, mandataries or representatives of the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personal information; and
iii.     Transat shall put in place all measures necessary to ensure the destruction and safe disposal of personal information.
J.     Transparency
Transat shall ensure that this Policy and the undertakings and rules of practice and procedure concerning the management of personal information set forth herein are readily accessible to anyone, especially its customers.

K.     Access to personal information
Any individual making a request in writing is entitled to be informed of the existence of personal information held by Transat on him or her, of the use made of such information and of the fact that this information was provided to third parties. The individual concerned is also entitled to access such information, subject to legislative and regulatory exceptions. The individual may also contest the accuracy or completeness of information and request that corrections be made. To exercise their right of access or of correction, the individuals concerned should contact Mr. George Petsikas, Director, Protection of Personal Information, Transat at the following address: 5959, boulevard de la Côte-Vertu, Montréal, Québec H4S 2E6.
i.     The applicant must identify himself or herself, provide his or her employee number (where applicable) and sign the request in order to prevent fraud or the unjustified transmission of personal information to a third party. The individual concerned shall provide sufficient information to enable Transat to confirm the existence of such personal information, to inform the applicant of the use thereof and to provide access thereto;
ii.     Transat shall process the request for access to or correction of personal information within thirty (30) days of receiving the request. This time limit may be extended by an additional period of thirty (30) days if processing the request would unreasonably interfere with Transat activities or if circumstances or the scope of the request make it impossible to meet this deadline;
iii.     Generally, Transat shall grant the applicant access to the personal information on him or her, or correct the information at no charge. It may, however, be necessary to charge a reasonable fee to recover any administrative costs or when the request for access to information or correction of information is complex.
iv.     With regard to the correction of personal information, Transat shall do so where the applicant can establish the incomplete nature or the inaccuracy of the information. As required, correction may involve a correction, withdrawal, or the addition of information; and
v.     Should the applicant be dissatisfied with the answer to a request for access to or correction of information, he or she may file a complaint with the Director.
L.     Complaints concerning non-compliance with the Policy
Should an individual feel that this Policy is not being complied with or should he or she be concerned by Transat practices, the individual concerned may submit a complaint to Transat by sending it to Mr. George Petsikas, Director, Protection of Personal Information, Transat.
i.     A complaint or request for an inquiry must be addressed in writing to the Director at the following address: 5959, boulevard de la Côte-Vertu, Montréal, Québec H4S 2E6; and
ii.     Any complaint or request for investigation shall be the subject of an inquiry or a reply within sixty (60) working days.

Respecting the privacy of our customers is one of exitnow.ca greatest concerns.

In fact, all direct communication with exitnow.ca (be it via e-mail, fax phone or mail) is kept confidential. We respect and will continue to respect your privacy. To book your vacation, however, we do need a minimal amount of personal information to process your transactions.
When you reserve or purchase travel services through exitnow.ca we are required to provide basic information (such as name and address) about you and your purchase to the designated tour operator, airline, or any other travel service provider. This ensures the successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements. Again, at exitnow.ca, everything is done to respect your privacy.

exitnow.ca will not send you any unsolicited information. Should you become a member of one of our various programs, you will receive information from us only as we originally indicated to you.
4. Payment
Residents of Canada and of the United States can pay online, or by phone using Visa, American Express or MasterCard.
When you reserve, full payment is required and will be debited from your credit card account. You will be notified with the invoice that will be transmitted upon reservation.
The purchase is 100 percent non-refundable, non-transferable and no changes are permitted by the purchaser or passengers.
The booking of travel services constitutes a contract between the customer and exitnow.ca, operating under Transat Distribution Canada inc. Unless the customer has paid in full, all prices may be increased at any time and for any reason.
