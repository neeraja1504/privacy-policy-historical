It also describes your choices regarding the use, access and correction of your Personal Data (as defined in section 3 of this Privacy Policy) and how to contact us if you have any further queries or complaints about our management of your personal information.
In this Privacy Policy, "you" and "your" refers to individual users of the Expensify Service, as well as to Members and Corporate Members.

If you submit Personal Data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Personal Data Collected via Technology
The Expensify Service (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collects Personal Data from you, such as browser type, your approximate geographic location of your mobile device or computer (from your Internet Protocol (IP) address), operating system and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, information about your application, operating environment and hardware profiles and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Identifiers (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Expensify Service and your activity on the Site and the Application. Like most internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site, use the Application or access your account on our network.
When you interact with the Site or the Application, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. We also use mobile device identifiers which perform a similar role, like the IDFA used by Apple devices and the UDID used by Android devices. Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site or Application (as the case may be). A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or Application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the Application. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site or Application and will last for longer. We refer to cookies and the mobile device equivalents as "Identifiers".
We use Identifiers to:
remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive;
customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site or Application;
collect statistical information about how you use the Site or App (including how long you spend on the Site or Application) and where you have come to the Site or Application from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site and which functions of the Application are most popular with users.
Usage information may be linked to your account in order to assist Expensify to provide services to your account, for example analysing data for the purposes of trouble shooting. Expensify will not sell or disclose usage data to any third party unless such usage data has been aggregated or de-identified and is no longer capable of identifying you as an individual.
Our Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook "Like" button and Widgets, such as the "Share this" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set an Identifier to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Some of the Identifiers used by the Site are set or accessed (as appropriate) by us, and some by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.
Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser or mobile device. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Site or Application, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Expensify Service.
In addition to cookies, web beacons may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site or Application. Web beacons are small image files within the content of the Site or Application for analytics purposes so we or third parties can understand which parts of the Site or Application are visited and which functions of the Site or Application are used and whether particular content is of interest.
