Privacy & Return Policy – Express Bitcoin Postage
You may return any unused labels within a time period of 14 days. You must provide proof of purchase. Once you initiate the refund request, it may take several days for the carrier to verify the return and issue credit. Once credit has been issued, the label is null and void and cannot be mailed. Once we receive notification that a credit has been issued, we will notify you and issue that credit to your account. We do not charge any fees to process any refunds unless the carrier imposes them.
