](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored#w_delete-cookies-for-a-single-site)
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

If you do not want to see advertising, we recommend you install ad blocking software on your browser. You will be able to use the site and view its contents normally even with an ad blocker installed.
Measuring Site Usage
We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous â€“ so we don't know who you are; just that somebody visited our site. The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better. You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.
Discussion Comments
To allow visitors to discuss classified ads, we use a discussion system called Disqus. To do so we embed code that Disqus provide and we do not control ourselves. Disqus anonymously tracks visitors to pages like we do. They also remember who you are if you login to any Disqus service, so you can comment on any website using their tool. Logging in to Disqus can be done in many ways, including via Facebook. If you login via social network, Disqus will be able to link your activity to that network. In this way, your Disqus activity may be personally identifiable. Disqus will know what pages you viewed in our site and what you wrote on those comments. Of course all comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your name, so we do not imagine this is a concern for many people.
Online Payment
We use CCBill Inc as our payment provider should you decide to purchase a Premium ad. CCBill will have access to your personal and payment information. When paying by credit card, Expatriates.com themselves do not ever have any access to your credit card details.
We share information with CCBill only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing payments you make via our website.
