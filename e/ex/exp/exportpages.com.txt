Cookies
Like most websites, Exportpages uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Exportpages to recognize you as a User when you return to the Exportpages website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the Exportpages website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our website.
One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Exportpages account. The next time you visit the Exportpages website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
Additionally, if you log out of the Exportpages website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Exportpages website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information about your professional or educational background, for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Exportpages website or services. Exportpages does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.

Sharing Information with Third Parties
