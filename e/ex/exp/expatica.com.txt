Expatica also collects information that users voluntarily provide to send out electronic newsletters, surveys and contests, as well as via Google Analytics.
How We Use Cookies and Data Collected by Third Parties
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to help track an individual’s movements around Expatica’s websites and monitor the presentation of advertisements. Cookies can be necessary when ordering a product online.
Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information. Third-party advertisers (e.g. Google, ImproveDigital) may use cookies on Expatica solely to monitor and track advertisement impressions.
By using the Expatica Communications B.V. site, you agree to the use of cookies as described. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may set your browser to refuse them. However, doing so may impair the functionality of some parts of the Expatica site.
How Third Parties Use Collected Information
Preference data is analysed by third parties to define groups into segments based on factors such as geography, gender, age, interests and online actions. For example, users could be grouped into segments such as males interested in cars or females interested in job offers, or a household with two children looking for real estate. These segments are used by online marketers and advertisers to deliver relevant and specific content marketing messages to online users.
Opting Out of Third-Party Data Collection
Online users can opt out of third-party preference data collection, for online behavioural advertising (OBA), using any of the following methods:
By using Your Online Choice opt-out tool, provided at www.youronlinechoices.com/opt-out, users can select the companies they want to stop from collecting OBA data. The opt-out tool downloads a browser cookie and will only work if the user’s browser is set to accept third-party cookies.
Changing the computer’s browser settings to block, delete and/or control the use of all third-party cookies. Refer to the computer’s web browsers’ Help documentation for more information about managing the use of cookies directly through the browser settings.
The opt-out tool and browser cookie management can be specific to each computer and each version and type of browser. If an opt-out cookie is deleted from a browser’s cookie files or if a different computer, browser version and/or browser type is used, the user may need to repeat the opt-out process to stop third-party data collection.
Newsletters
We send a newsletter to subscribers regularly, and we occasionally send out special editions. Users can remove themselves from any of our mailing lists by following the unsubscribe link provided in each email/newsletter, or by unsubscribing in the newsletter subscription area of our website.
Expatica allows selected advertisers to include information in mailings and newsletters sent by Expatica. We do not give third parties direct access to your details without your permission. Our users may opt out from receiving emails from our partners if they would prefer not to receive our partners’ promotions. You may change this preference at any time.
