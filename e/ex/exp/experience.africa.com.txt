AFRICA.COM Privacy Policy - Africa.com
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Africa.com and Africa.comDEALS.
This privacy policy covers www.africa.com. Because Africa.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Customer Service by sending an e-mail to support@africa.com.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) Personally identifiable information, which includes personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) Non-personally identifiable information, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.
Personally Identifiable Information
Registration for our Web sites
Anyone can view our sites, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services offered across our different sites. Africa.com requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information, including a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income (optional), job industry and job title) to register. By using Africa.com, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service. Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
On occasion, Africa.com collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than Africa.com, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
Africa.com may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. From time to time, we may use different technologies, including cookies, to better understand answers to our surveys.
Mobile Messaging Service
Africa.com uses the information collected from your interaction with Africa.com by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. Africa.com collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and Africa.com. When you send a text message to Africa.com or via Africa.com, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. Africa.com uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.
Non-personally Identifiable Information
In addition to personally identifiable information, we also collect certain non-personally identifiable information through technology and tools, including cookies and log data. We aggregate and analyze this information in order to learn more about how our Web sites are used.
Cookies from Us
As is standard practice on many Web sites, we use “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of our Web sites, including Africa.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us.
Cookies from Advertisers
Some advertisements on certain of our Web sites (including Africa.com) are served by third-party advertising companies. In the course of serving these advertisements, these advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Web sites and other Web sites.
We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ cookies or how they may be used. Google is one of the companies that serves advertisements onto Africa.com. It uses the DART cookie to serve ads based on your visit to Africa.com and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. Your access to our Web sites will not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
Statistical Analysis
Africa.com may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.

We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.
