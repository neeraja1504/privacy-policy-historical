Your privacy is a priority at RudeSpace, and we go to great lengths to protect it.
Why we collect personal information
We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you.

What information we collect and how we may use it
There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example:
We may ask for your personal information when you’re requesting support or service over the phone or purchasing a product.

We may use personal information to provide products that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve RudeSpace services.
Publicly displayed information is public
If you use support forum or community site provided by RudeSpace then you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. RudeSpace is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, RudeSpace will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.

There are also times when it may be advantageous for RudeSpace to make certain personal information about you available to companies that RudeSpace has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for RudeSpace to provide products and services to you on our behalf.
