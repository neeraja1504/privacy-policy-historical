When an event organiser creates account on Explara in order to use the platform, Explara becomes the data controller of the data that is provided by the event organiser as part of the account opening process.
"If a consumer provides personal details during the course of creating an account then in that case, Explara becomes the data controller of the data provided by the consumer to Explara. Explara would also be the controller of those data or details provided by the consumer or the event organiser for the usage of other services offered by Explara"

"Explara provides various services to the consumer on behalf of the organiser such as issuing E-ticket for an event, sending emails to the consumer on behalf of the organiser, processing online and offline payments, event marketing reports that analyze the effectiveness of various sales channel".

This can be accomplished by removing the event from the dashboard. In such cases, the event organiser will not be able to see the data. Organisers can also delete their non financial data of an event. In such cases, the personal data of the organiser will be removed and at the same time, the personal data of the consumer will be anonymized. But in any case, the financial data of the attendee remains with the system for quite sometime to fight chargeback or any other financial dispute with the regulatory agencies or bank."
