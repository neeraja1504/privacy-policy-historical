SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
We will not disclose your Personally Identifying Information to third parties except as described in this Policy, to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. You agree that we may also disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process. Please note that we may be required to release an individual’s personal information in response to a legal inquiry from public authorities including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to third party service providers that assist us with carrying out these purposes. For example, we may use a data processing contractor to operate computer systems on our behalf, for administrative, technical support, or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. Whenever any Personally Identifying Information is transferred to a such a third party service provider, that party will be contractually bound to use such Personally Identifying Information only to carry out the services we have requested, to abide by our Policy, and to provide adequate protection for the Personally Identifying Information.

SECURITY
We use a variety of technologies and processes to protect Personally Identifying Information collected on the sites, including physical, technological, and organizational security measures. For example, we use encryption technology whenever transmitting personal information. Unfortunately, no security technology is completely secure, and you should remember that email is not a secure means of communication. We retain Personally Identifying Information that we collect only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements.
Some or all of the Personally Identifying Information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside of your country, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from those where you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain protections on the Personally Identifying Information that are equivalent to those in your country.
