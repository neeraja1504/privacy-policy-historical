Security
We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information. All the data collected by us is stored on a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. For your part you should ensure that the credentials you use to access Experian systems are kept securely. Passwords should not be guessable. We strongly recommend that, as a minimum, passwords are a minimum of 8 characters long and contain a mix of upper and lower case characters and numbers. Passwords should be changed frequently, and they should never be written down or shared.
Data protection statement
Personal information about you which we obtain in the course of considering your suitability for employment will be stored and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The data will be processed in relation to your application to work for Experian or for the inclusion in your personal records if you become an Experian employee.
For the purposes of complying with the Data Protection Act, the personal information about you will be used by Experian Background Checking to discharge its duties as laid out in its contract with Experian, which specifically includes the passing on of personal information to Experian. This will not be disclosed for any other purpose without the express permission of the applicant.
In processing this information, Experian may use the services of third parties, possibly based outside the UK or European Economic Area. However all third parties are thoroughly vetted by Experian and your information will only be used for the purposes of processing your application and considering your suitability for employment.
The information collected will be retained for profile matching purposes and put forward where appropriate to selected members of Experian HR and line managers when recruiting for future opportunities that match your profile.
The information collected will be retained for the purpose of screening you for employment with Experian and you understand that if offered the position, employment will be subject to satisfactory employer references and satisfactory results from any other background checks that may be required.
If employed by Experian, such checks may then be repeated periodically throughout your employment with the Company.
It is your responsibility to maintain and update your data held in this system, however Experian may from time to time request, via email, that you update your data. You have the right to access and update your data at any time by accessing this system. Data will not be kept for longer than is necessary and will be removed from our database at your request. If you wish Experian to delete your profile, please contact us.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the computer you are using for the processing of your data is adequately secured and protected against malicious software, such as trojans, computer viruses and worm programs. You are aware of the fact that without adequate security measures (e.g. secure web browser configuration, up-to-date antivirus software, personal firewall software, no usage of software from dubious sources) there is a risk that the data and passwords you use to protect access to your data, could be disclosed to unauthorized third parties.
Verification of personal data
I authorise Experian Background Checking or any agent thereof to carry out all necessary enquiries to verify the information I have submitted on this form or any other information which may be relevant to my application.
I also authorise Experian Background Checking to verify my identity either by me providing appropriate documentation as requested or by Experian Background Checking undertaking a search to check the details supplied against my particulars on any databases to which they have access
I authorise Experian Background Checking, or any agent thereof, to make enquiries of the school, college or university or other educational establishment where a qualification was gained
I authorise enquiries to be made of my financial and credit history where applicable. These checks will only use data that is held within Experian’s systems, by fraud prevention agencies or other appropriate third parties.
I understand that I will be required to produce documentation that is required by law to establish my right to work in the UK or EEA.
I understand that Experian may also require that a check is made on any criminal convictions I may have had in the past. I give consent to Disclosure Scotland to mail my disclosure certificate directly to Experian Background Checking and consent to Experian Background Checking opening and handling my disclosure certificate. I authorise Experian Background Checking to provide details of my disclosure report to Experian and to hold a copy of my disclosure until 6 weeks after the completion of my background check.
I understand that Experian Background Checking will endeavour to carry out all enquiries in a proper and sensitive way and I authorise them to speak to or otherwise communicate with me concerning any ambiguity or other reason, in order that such enquiries can fairly and diligently be carried out.
I understand that if any information gives cause for concern Experian will discuss the information with me and the possible impact on my employment.
I authorise Experian Background Checking to retain this information and to provide this to any other future employer with my consent.
Should our investigations identify fraud or the commission of any other criminal offence by you (on your part) when applying for, or during the course of your employment with us, we will record details of this on fraud prevention databases. This information may be accessed from the UK and other countries and used by law enforcement agencies and by us and other employers (and potential employers) to prevent fraud. If you want to receive details of those fraud prevention agencies write to us at Experian Ltd, PO Box 8000, Nottingham, NG80 7WF. You have a legal right to these details.
Please note that these checks will only be carried out if your application is successful. If your application is unsuccessful, no such checks will be carried out on you.
I understand that if I supply untrue information or wilfully mislead in any answers given then this may subsequently lead to any offer of employment being withdrawn, or where employment has already commenced, the termination of such employment.
