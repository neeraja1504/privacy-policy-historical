Protect Your Privacy and Safety
Effective Date: September 1, 2011
JoBooKIT Technologies LTD. ("JoBookIt", "We" or "Our") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can use the "Exact Me!" Site on your own terms. JoBookIt continues to strive to provide the safest possible environment for you to search for and apply to jobs.
JoBookIt Precautions
Overview
We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding personal information that we collect through "Exact Me!" website. This Privacy Policy applies only to data gathered on any web site under JoBookIt's control (collectively, the "Sites"), and does not apply to any other information or web site. This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms and Conditions for the Sites, which apply to this privacy policy.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. Each time you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. If we materially change our practices with regard to personal information collected under a prior privacy policy, we will endeavor to notify you and give you the opportunity to opt out of changes with regard to that previously collected information. You agree that by using the Sites you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below.
Personal Information
In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, JoBookIt may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address) and other content posted by its users to the Site (e.g., resumes and profiles), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post, modify or delete their original content on our Sites (e.g., jobs, resumes and profiles) or to cancel their account. We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user's computer browser information, and their IP address. You agree that JoBookIt may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings, services, educational or other career development opportunities), or provide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Sites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication or by sending an e-mail to the address listed on the Site. JoBookIt may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous information to prepare reports that it provides to its users.
All users should be aware that when they choose to display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which JoBookIt is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a link from a JoBookIt affiliate or other affiliate's web site. If so, please be aware that JoBookIt may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.
JoBookIt may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of JoBookIt or other users of the Sites. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of JoBookIt. Such disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without notice.
Credit Card Security
JoBookIt employs encryption for secure credit card transactions.
