(“Examity”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the data of its clients, associates, and website visitors.  We want you to understand how we collect and use information through our services and from our website (collectively, “Site”) so you can interact with Examity with confidence.  By using Examity’s Site you accept and agree to the practices this Privacy Policy describes.

Information relating to your education, including an educational institution’s student’s name, the name of the student’s parent or other family members, the address of the student or student’s family, personal identifier such as the student number or biometric record[1], other indirect identifiers, such as student’s date of birth, other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty, or information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates, as well as other personally identifiable information about other customers or employees, including, but not limited to, driver’s license number or state-issued identification card number, or financial account number, credit card number, or debit card number with or without any required security code, access code, personal identification number or password, that would permit access to an individual’s financial account.
Details of your visits to our Site and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time you accessed or left the Site, and which pages you viewed. Some parts of our Site use cookies, pixel tags (also known as “web beacons”), and other technologies to collect this information about your general internet usage.  See the section below called “How We Use Cookies and Pixel Tags” to learn more.
Information that you provide directly to us by filling in forms on our Site, including your name, email address, street address, telephone number, or other information.
Information provided to us when you communicate with us for any reason, including information you provide in emails you send us.
If our online proctoring services are used, your webcam and computer screen may be monitored, viewed, recorded, and/or audited to ensure the integrity of the exams, including by Examity, proctors, and university and/or test sanctioning body staff.  This means that you and your immediate surroundings, and anything else within range of your webcam or viewable on your computer screen, may be monitored, viewed, recorded, and/or audited during your exam.
How We Use Cookies and Pixel Tags
A “cookie” is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  Keep in mind, however, that some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies.
While we use cookies and pixel tags, we do not track our users across websites or over time.
“Do Not Track” Requests
Examity’s Site currently does not respond to “do not track” or similar signals.
Use of Your Information
We use the information we collect from you primarily to enable us to provide our services in the best possible manner, including our online proctoring and exam integrity services.  In addition, your information may be used for the following purposes:
To provide you, including via your email address, with information relating to our services;
To administer our Site, including by monitoring and analyzing our Site traffic and usage patterns.
Security
We use commercially suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. These procedures include, but are not limited to, firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and Site monitoring.  We also limit access to any personally identifiable information we receive to staff who need access to that information in order to do their jobs.  However, no data protection procedures are entirely infallible. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that it will be 100% secure.  Your transmission of your data to our Site thus is done entirely at your own risk.

We may share your personal information as follows:
Generally: We may share your personal information with trusted third parties or our affiliates to assist us in providing our service, including by acting on our behalf to process credit card payments, and provide customer assistance. Such third parties have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions, but they are not allowed to use it for other purposes.  We do not sell or rent personal information collected through Examity’s Site to anyone.
Other Circumstances:  We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of any or all of our business and/or our assets to a third party, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to:
Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process (such as a subpoena), or lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations of such Terms, or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; and/or
Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Examity, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

Examity’s Site may contain links to other sites, including those of third parties or business partners.  While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices other websites use.  By accessing other third party websites or applications through our Site, you are consenting to the terms and privacy policies of those websites.  It is possible that other parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you use Examity’s Site.
Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button.  These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.  Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.  Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the entity providing them.

Access, Correction, and Deletion
Examity ensures that individuals have access to the personal data they have provided to Examity. Individuals will be able to correct, amend, or delete that information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated, or as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. Examity employs role-based permissions to ensure adequate access and security is provided to the stored personal information.
Onward Transfer
Examity is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to protect data transferred to third parties. Examity requires such third parties to enter into contracts ensuring that your data is only processed for the limited and specified purposes consistent with your authorization.

Upon request, we will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of our contract with the third-party recipient.

Training
Examity’s privacy policies and procedures shall be documented, reviewed yearly, and updated as necessary in response to environmental or operational changes affecting privacy of Examity’s PI. The yearly review of documentation will be handled by the CTO’s office and duly signed off by senior management. In addition to the internal review, Examity shall establish its security training to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
