COOKIES
Our Service uses "Cookies" to distinguish you from other users of our Service and to anonymously track visiting and browsing patterns.

Cookies can collect information about users of our Service like you, such as your names, address, e-mail details, passwords and your user preferences. While cookies and the information they obtain may not identify a living individual on their own, they may be able to do so in combination with other information held by us or a third party. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Service and also allows us to improve our site. The website uses session cookies for site navigation purposes. These cookies expire and are deleted at the end of a browsing session. We also use Google Analytics for tracking and data capture purposes. Data collected through cookies is always anonymous and aggregated.

The data that we collect from you will not be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area which consists of the European Union, Norway and Iceland ("EEA").

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. A server is a machine that amongst others stores and processes data or information.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Service or your account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of or sending by you of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted or sent by you to our Service; any transmission or sending by you is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access i.e. access to your data by a person who should not have such access.
