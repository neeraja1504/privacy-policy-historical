Last Updated: May 15, 2018
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Exodus Movement, Inc. and its related
companies (“Exodus”) collect, use and share personal information of consumer users of this
website, https://www.exodus.io (the “Site”).
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Exodus is committed to personal privacy. We do not need, or want, any information about the
identities of the people using our product in order to deliver our service. Except for the very
limited technical data collection mentioned below, which is essentially foundational to all
websites, the only information that we receive about individuals is what is voluntarily provided to
us in connection with inquiries, whether from people curious about Exodus or users of our
product seeking support. It comes down to this:
WE ONLY USE PERSONAL DATA TO PROVIDE REQUESTED SUPPORT OR RESPOND TO
INQUIRIES. WE NEVER COLLECT PERSONAL DATA ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT
THEIR CONSENT.
WHAT WE COLLECT
As noted above, we are not interested in learning anything more about our users and visitors
than is absolutely necessary for us to provide information about our services, and support to
users of those services. We get information about you, which may include information that
allows us to identify an individual, natural person (such as an email address or phone number)
(collectively, “Personal Data”) in only the limited ways set forth below.
Information You Give Us.​ We collect only information you directly give us on our Site as via
email or other correspondence (chat, phone) as required to provide customer support.
