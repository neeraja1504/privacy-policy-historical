EXTREME Overclocking | Tweaking Enthusiast PC Hardware Product Reviews And News
Our Commitment To Privacy:
Your privacy is important to us. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on various parts of our website, in our forum, and when you signup for a contest. EXTREME Overclocking will never sell or give your personal information to advertisers, sponsors, or any third party company.
Registration:
You may be required to register for a member account (free, of course) to access specific areas of our site or to get involved in our community (forums). We require all new registrations to be authenticated by you. We do this by sending you an email after you have registered to "activate" your account on EXTREME Overclocking. This helps to cut down on spam and users that try to create more than one account on EXTREME Overclocking. We may require that you provide your email that was assigned to you by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) when registering for your EXTREME Overclocking account. However, your email will NEVER be given or sold to advertisers, sponsors, or any other 3rd party companies. Again, we do this to cut down on users who try to signup for multiple accounts. You will never receive any further emails from EXTREME Overclocking (Exceptions include the one time activation email, and an occasional email to verify your email account is still valid).
Mailing List:
The EXTREME Overclocking mailing lists are a way for us to communicate with our audience by offering news, reviews, and other relevant information. Our mailing list readers will be the first to know when we release new reviews, how-to guides, and other big site news. All that is required by you, is a valid email address. Unlike our registration process that may require your ISP email address, our mailing list will accept any valid email address. Like our registration process, you will receive an email from us that verifies your email and your intent to join the mailing list. EXTREME Overclocking will never sell or give your personal information to advertisers, sponsors, or any third party company.

A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.

Security:

Even if you choose to "show" your email address in our forums, initial contact must be submitted through an online form, so other users will not know your actual email address unless you reply to them. On the Internet there are "spam bots", which surf the Internet and collect every email address they find and place them in a database, then they send junk email to all of these users. We take every effort possible to block these "spam bots" and filter / remove any publicly posted email addresses.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
