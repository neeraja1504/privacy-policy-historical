Privacy Policy Notice - ClickFunnels
I. Personally-Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Etison, LLC (also referred to herein as “ClickFunnels”) may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). PII is information that identifies you as an individual – for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, billing address and shipping information. Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and other information that does not reveal your specific identity. PII and Non-PII may be collected anytime you access or use a ClickFunnels website. PII and Non-PII may also be collected by ClickFunnels during in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications. ClickFunnels also collects information via cookies; blocking cookies may render you unable to access certain ClickFunnels products, services, or websites.
ClickFunnels uses PII to respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of services ClickFunnels thinks may be of interest to you, and otherwise personalize your experience with ClickFunnels, and other reasons. ClickFunnels does not sell or lease PII about you to others. ClickFunnels may share PII with ClickFunnels affiliates and third parties contracting with ClickFunnels to provide services to you, e.g., financial institutions. ClickFunnels may also share PII when required by law, or when you have expressly requested ClickFunnels to do so. ClickFunnels reserves the right to disclose and use your PII if ClickFunnels believes it is necessary to: (a) respond to legal process, e.g., a subpoena; (b) respond to a law enforcement agency’s request; (c) enforce the Terms; or (d) protect the rights, privacy, safety, property, or operations of ClickFunnels or third parties;
Because Non-PII does not personally identify You, ClickFunnels reserves the right to use and disclose to third parties Non-PII for any purpose.
ClickFunnels maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. ClickFunnels enforces its Privacy Policy via self-assessment.
ClickFunnels reserves the right to change this privacy notice, which changes will become effective upon posting of the revised notice https://www.clickfunnels.com/privacy, or upon emailing of the changes to You at the email address You provided to ClickFunnels, or as required by law.
II. Links to or From Other Sites.
Except where expressly stated by ClickFunnels, ClickFunnels is not affiliated or associated with operators of any third party websites that link to or are linked from any ClickFunnels-maintained website. ClickFunnels disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or content of information found on third party websites that link to or are linked from any ClickFunnels website. ClickFunnels disclaims any responsibility for the security of any information (including without limitation credit card and personally identifiable information (“PII”)) that you may provide to any third party. ClickFunnels reserves the right, at any time and in its sole and absolute discretion, to block links to any ClickFunnels-maintained website through technological or other means without prior notice.
