Privacy Policy - Referral Programs | Extole
Last Updated January 11, 2019
Introduction
Extole, Inc. ( "Extole" ,  "us"  or  "we" ) offers a referral, advocacy, and analytics platform enabling brands (our " Clients ")--whether those brands use websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to allow their end users’ (" Users ") to share, refer, and engage on those website and devices with content, and to derive additional insights into how their Users experience the brand. Extole recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and secure data and  describes your rights in determining what we do with the information that we collect or hold about you.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts, and is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions:
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: This section explains how information is collected about our Clients’ Users, and used, by Extole in connection with the provision of our products and services (the " Extole Services " or the " Services ").
Collection and Use of Information from Our Website: This section explains how information is collected and used by us from our website visitors through our website located at www.extole.com (the " Website "), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at my.extole.com. If you are a Client using our Extole dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you.
Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: This section lays out the parts of the Extole Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.
Collection and Use of Information from Our Services
What Information Does Extole Collect from Our Services?
Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
The Extole Services: Overview
Extole provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients deliver content, including rewards and links, to their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices, and applications so that Users can share content, links, and rewards with one another. Extole helps Clients by providing analytics to Clients. This information is used by the Client to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences.
Extole has no direct relationship with Users. Extole’s Services are provided when Extole Clients install on their platforms “Extole Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture the User action on behalf of the Client. By associating the information collected from these Mechanisms, Extole creates and stores identifiers unique to individual clients in the Extole platform, and then uses a variety of techniques to connect these User actions and identifiers together. Some of these common connection techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform. These techniques help Clients match Users and issue rewards based on those matches. Extole stores this information separately for each Client program and does combine specific actions and information about individuals between different Client programs.
The key use cases of Extole’s service are:
To support Clients in implementing refer-a-friend programs typically using rewards based on key events such as purchase.
For example, Extole helps a Client create and deliver a sharing UI on a Clients website or app so that Users can create links and send them to other Users in email, over social networks, and directly to recommend purchase or sign-up. Extole tracks the events in this referral process and helps Clients deliver reward to Users.
To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s referral and advocacy initiatives to the Client directly.
For example, Extole can tell a Client how many Users shared, visited their website, registered for their service, and/or purchased. Extole can also tell a Client about the rewards issued as a result of those events.
To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted offers and content to their Users depending on Client determined criteria in order to deliver more relevant referral and advocacy content and rewards.
For example, a Client can use Extole Mechanisms to provide a tailored reward like a coupon code in the Client's website to users who have interacted with the Client's app and/or website in the past.
Extole requires that each Client commit to share with Extole only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users, or from their parents for children under 13, or in certain jurisdictions such as the European Union, under 16), and that it has the right to share with Extole, and we strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information that is not necessary for the provision of the Services.
In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
Information Collected By Extole Links, Pixels, and Tags
Extole collects the following information from web URLs created by the Client and Users and from pixels and tags placed by the Client on its websites. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“ Personal Data ”).
Type of Information Collected | Purpose
---|---
IP Address | Standard web HTTP request; used for matching
Cookie | Standard web cookies, used for matching
Link Data | Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics
User Agent | Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for matching
Referrer | Standard web browser HTTP referrer; may be used for reporting and analytics
Request | Standard web HTTP request
Address Book Information
Clients may allow Users in a sharing UI to connect their address books from Google, Yahoo, and other providers in order to simplify sharing by Users.
Extole will only collect the first name, last name, and email address of the individual(s) Users select from their address books in order to:
Personalize share messages;
Deliver the share or referral message on that platform;
Support accurate recognition of a referral in order to provide rewards depending on the rules of the Client program.
How Does Extole Use Information Collected by Our Services?
Data Extole collects through the Services is processed:
to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Extole Services.
to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Extole does not control how Clients use information Extole shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Extole.
to analyze and aggregate Client data with data of other Clients for Extole’s own internal business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot be linked back to any individual person or Client, and share these reports with the public.
Our Clients’ Use of Information
Our Clients use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ brand experience and to better understand their marketing programs and how Users experience their brand and products. For example, a User may want to share information about a retailer that she loves with a friend. When that User sends her friend an Extole link to that retailer, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the website where often the Client will provide a reward because of User recommendation applicable at purchase. When the friend purchases, the Client will often give the User a reward as well. The Client would gain insights and analytics as to how their site and rewards appeal to Users and friends.
We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with the law. Extole is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy and terms and conditions. Users should review the privacy policy and terms and conditions of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.
User Opt-Outs
Extole supports functionality to allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data privacy rights. Clients can flag in the Extole SDK that a particular User has requested that their data not be processed by Extole, in which case Extole will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
