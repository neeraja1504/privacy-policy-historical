E-mpire Privacy Policy
E-mpire's policies and procedures for handling client information have been created with the understanding that Internet technologies are still evolving and that Internet business methods are continuing to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities of the changing technologies. As a result, Empire's policies and procedures are subject to change, always with client security held as the utmost priority.
In the case of serving our clients, E-mpire acquires, stores, and transmits client communications and information that clients may regard as private or sensitive (name, address, telephone number, credit card information), which is provided to E-mpire by our clients in order to establish membership. Other information (account status and access logs) is created and maintained by E-mpire in the normal course of providing service.
E-mpire will protect the confidentiality of our client's information, account information, and personal communications to the fullest extent possible and consistent with the law and legitimate interests of E-mpire, our partners, our employees, and other clients of our services. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from clients, E-mpire has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place.
E-mpire will not disclose its client's personal or account information unless E-mpire has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of E-mpire, our clients, or other affiliates, or where E-mpire has a good belief that the law requires such disclosure.
E-mpire disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through our facilities by clients or otherwise. E-mpire will review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm E-mpire, our clients, third parties, or affiliates. The grounds on which E-mpire may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations which are in the Terms of Service Agreement.
