Cookies
Either eMeals or our Service Providers may use cookies in your web browser or utilize tracking pixels to analyze or enhance the use of our Services.

Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by eMeals other than the Personal Information collected through the Site or Services. It does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to eMeals through this Service or any other means, which includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service or to related forums or social media sites.

Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information against theft, loss, and unauthorized access.

Given the global nature of our society, eMeals conducts business globally, which may result in the transfer of your information internationally. Therefore, by using eMeals you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your information outside of your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or Service Providers. You understand that countries that we may transfer information to may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as your country, although your personal information will continue to be protected in accordance with the standards described in this Policy.
