By browsing this Site, you agree that you have read and understand the following Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in its entirety, including any updates that may be posted on the Site from time to time. Kivuto Solutions Inc. reserves the right to revise the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, at its sole discretion, by updating this posting.
What information do you gather about me?
Both personally and non-personally identifiable information about each visitor may be gathered from this site. The type of information gathered depends on your actions and interaction with the site.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information is only collected when you voluntarily submit this information on an as-needed basis such as during registration and ordering. Any personal information that you may share with us is kept private. Neither your name nor any other identifying data about you is sold or shared with any other third party unless required for the fulfillment or refund of your order or service. More information on this use is provided later in this privacy policy.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifying information is gathered through our site technology to create a more personalized and relevant experience during your visit. The information also allows us to improve the functionality of the website to better serve you.
How do you collect and use personally identifiable information?
Collecting Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information may be collected during registration, ordering and billing, during customer service interactions or when you enter a contest. Personally identifiable information is never shared in ways unrelated to the methods described below without notifying you of the intent beforehand, and also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Registration
During registration, you may be prompted for your name and email address for authentication and verification purposes. These steps may be necessary to ensure users are properly identified and authenticated as a qualified user. Some offerings and promotions on this site may be restricted to members of certain organizations and, by providing your email address, and subsequently having your account verified, you may benefit from these offerings and promotions.
Ordering and Billing
When you place an order, you may need to supply your credit card information along with the corresponding mailing information. This information may be required to fulfill your order. Your credit card information is not stored on our server; it is simply passed on to the credit card processing system for validation. You may also be prompted for your name and email address to create your online receipt and for us to send you order related emails.
Customer Service
Personally identifiable information may be collected if you report a problem or submit an inquiry to our customer service team(s). A record of that correspondence may be maintained to provide you with an optimal customer service experience.
Entering a Contest or Promotion
Furthermore, information from you may be collected for entry into contests and similar promotions when you voluntarily choose to participate. All contests have their own privacy policy which can be viewed under the contest section on the OnTheHub website.
Using Personally Identifiable Information
Your personally identifiable information is not sold, traded or rented to others.
We do employ other trusted companies to perform certain functions on our behalf, including order fulfillment and delivery, as well as credit card processing. These business affiliates have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to use your personal information for any other purpose.
Additionally, information related to the order of a product may be shared with the supplier of that particular product, for warranty and support purposes. This may include your name, date of your order and product purchased.
If you have questions about how one of our business partners or suppliers use information about you, contact them directly.
How can I access, update or delete my personal information?
Users have the ability to correct or change any information or preferences in their account profile. Users may change this information at any time, provided they are signed in.
You can deactivate or delete your account, but by doing so will result in limiting your access to any members-only areas of the site. Any purchase history information however, will remain in protected permanent records.
How do you collect and use non-personally identifiable information?
We use technologies like cookies, pixel tags (“pixels”), and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads, on and off our sites.
Collecting non-personally identifiable information
Your verification status is collected once you successfully register through any of our verification services. The resulting status is non-personally identifiable information and is stored in case you need to verify your status again in the future.
Non-personally identifiable information is collected using technology such as cookies. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your local storage. The information collected by this technology is non-personally identifiable only and allows us to optimize your interactions with the site.
Using non-personally identifiable information
Cookies allow for customer traffic patterns and site usage to be monitored on a general basis to help develop and improve the design, layout and efficiency of the website. Understanding these patterns allows us to provide more relevant content to you and improve customer relationships. Furthermore, the information collected is used to create targeted communications to offer you a more personalized and customizable experience. Cookies also save you time by remembering your personalized settings.
Note that all information is collected and analyzed in aggregated form only. Check your browser to ensure cookies are enabled for this site to work properly.
Kivuto Solutions Inc. may use third-party advertising technology partners to serve you relevant advertisements on websites outside of our network. The advertising technology partner provides us with tracking technology, such as a cookie, which is added to your browser by us. This allows us to serve you very relevant ads on their partner websites according to your engagements with this site. If you would like to learn more about this process or even opt-out, please contact us.
How to manage cookies
Browser controls are available to allow, block or delete cookies. To manage the cookies this site and others use, visit the following site for instructions: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies

What security is in place to protect my information?
Your information is protected both during transmission and in storage. Your account and profile information are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. During purchase, the secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is transmitted. As such, all customer data is protected against unauthorized access on the system’s secure servers.
Where will my information be processed?

Most Kivuto powered sites or WebStores are currently hosted on servers located within the United States, but the locations of our servers may change from time-to-time.
