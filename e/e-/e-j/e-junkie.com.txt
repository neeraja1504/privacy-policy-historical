Privacy Policy
Sine Info Ventures Pvt. Ltd is a company incorporated in New Delhi, India.
This Privacy Policy covers visitors to www.e-junkie.com ("Site") and business customers who have registered with E-junkie and its subsidiaries ("We"). Capitalised terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth herein or in the E-junkie Terms of Service found at https://www.e-junkie.com/wiki/terms.
We collect information primarily to provide better services to all of our customers. We collect information you provide to us on our Site such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, company name, and demographics. E-junkie gathers the following types of information about users:
Personal Data we handle as a Data Processor, only for the purpose of providing the Services in accordance with documented instructions from you (provided that such instructions are commensurate with the functionalities of the Services), and as may subsequently be agreed to by you. If E-junkie is required by law to Process the Personal Data for any other purpose, E-junkie will provide you with prior notice of this requirement, unless E-junkie is prohibited by law from providing such notice;
Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions like registration, to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums;
When you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected. This may include information such as the Operating System (OS) running on your device, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type, and language, visitor's domain name and the website you visited before our Site. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about the visitor. This information maybe be used for purposes such as examining traffic and to investigate misuse or abuse of any aspect of this site. We also collect information about how you use E-junkie's product(s). This information is stored in a protected area of the site's logs and may be shared at the discretion of Sine Info Ventures Pvt. Ltd. with appropriate law-enforcement bodies or in good faith with other third parties. We do not collect nor evaluate this information for specific individuals.

We use the information we collect primarily to provide, maintain, protect and improve our current products and to develop new ones. We use personal information collected through our Site as described in this Policy or on our Site. For example, we may use your information to:
Improve our services, Site and how we operate our business;
Understand and enhance your experience using our Site, products and services;
Provide and deliver products and services you request;
Process, manage, complete, and account for transactions;
Provide customer support and respond to your requests, comments and inquiries;
Invite you to participate in customer research;
Create and manage online accounts you establish;
Send you related information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;

Protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, unauthorised or illegal activity.
When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, we do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users, but we don't track which terms any particular user enters. E-junkie creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
Information provided to your users
We may display the following information to logged-in users according to their access level: first name and last name, analytics showing user usage of our platform, end user names, emails and sales data, user feedback and exceptions.

In no event shall E-junkie, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, be liable to products/applications users for the revealing of information by the logged-in users after obtaining such information by them from the Company.
