Privacy policy - ECAL
Updated 10th June 2016
Your privacy matters
ECAL is a free service owned and operated worldwide by E-DIARY Pty Ltd ( E-Diary ). We take a strong stance on user privacy and protection, and this helps to underpin how we develop our product, the service we offer, and how we gather and respect your personal information.
Introduction
ECAL allows users to receive communications and information (in the form of an Event or Schedule ) into their personal digital calendar ( Calendar ). Users will typically initiate a calendar subscription or connection via the digital network (such as website, email, social media) of third party organisations ( ** Publishers** ) whose Events or Schedules the user wishes to synchronise with their calendar. Publishers may include sports teams, sports leagues, media organisations, ticketing companies, retailers, financial institutions, community groups and others.
In most cases, E-Diary’s contract with the Publisher will specify that the Publisher owns any user information collected via the ECAL service. However, in every case E-Diary will store that user information on E-Diary’s servers and systems, and we therefore take the privacy and security of user information very seriously. We are committed to ensuring that we collect, use, disclose and store your information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, and we are committed to ensuring that our Publishers do the same.
This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect in connection with the ECAL service and how we use and disclose it. By providing personal information to us or using the service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may vary this Privacy Policy from time to time, the most recent version can always be accessed at www.ecal.com. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy at www.ecal.com.
ECAL ‘Contact Standards’
ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO FOLLOW OUR OWN ECAL CONTACT AND COMMUNICATIONS POLICY (“CONTACT STANDARDS”), AND ASK OUR PUBLISHERS TO ALSO FOLLOW OUR CONTACT STANDARDS AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THE ECAL CONTACTS STANDARDS ENDEAVOUR TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SENT TO YOUR CALENDAR (WHETHER BY THE PUBLISHER OR E-DIARY) IS DEEMED ‘SPECIFIC’, ‘RELEVANT’ AND / OR OF ‘REASONABLE VALUE’ TO YOU (BASED ON YOUR KNOWN PROFILE) OR ONE OF YOUR CHOSEN SCHEDULES OR EVENTS.
FURTHER, E-DIARY WILL NOT ACCESS ANY OTHER INFORMATION IN YOUR PERSONAL CALENDAR, INCLUDING YOUR PRIVATE EVENTS, MEETINGS, APPOINTMENTS, ETC., OTHER THAN EVENTS AND SCHEDULES THAT YOU HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO USING THE ECAL SERVICE.
Information gathering
We may collect the following types of information:

For example, we may collect data relating to you subscribing to a Schedule, opening, accepting or declining specific Events within a Schedule, the Calendar software platform you are using, device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number), click-stream data, your location, browser fingerprints, the Calendar and browser’s communication with our servers and information from your social networks if you use our social/‘single sign on’ We may also use audience and traffic measurement services that allow us (and Publishers and our third party marketing agencies and partners) to collect anonymous traffic and behavioral information from the ECAL service by monitoring anonymous visitor activity through the use of cookies and other technologies.
Information from other sources – We may receive information about you from other online and offline sources (including publicly available social network information) and add it to your personal information.

How we may use the information collected
The information we collect may be used to:
contact you in relation to your ECAL service, a particular Schedule or a particular Event;
ensure that ECAL content is presented in the most effective and secure manner for you and for your device and settings;

We may not be able to do these things without your personal information, which would limit the ability for us to provide the ECAL service to you.

This optional service is offered by the Publisher and is governed by their own privacy policy.
Suppliers and agents: We may employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
