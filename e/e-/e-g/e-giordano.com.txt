8       Transfers
As noted in section 6 above, Giordano may transfer your personal data to other countries

For the purposes of the GDPR, the European Commission issues adequacy decisions on the
data privacy laws of non-EU countries and/or regions. A list of current adequacy decisions
is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-
protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
The majority of countries and/or regions to which Giordano may transfer personal data are
not covered by an European Commission adequacy decision. However, many of them do
have local data privacy laws which are similar to the GDPR.

to: (a) only use that personal data for the purposes for which it was disclosed; (b) use all
technical and organisational measures which are reasonable in the circumstances to secure
that personal data; (c) delete that personal data when it is no longer required; and (d)
