Personal Information may also be provided when a School District User uploads certain materials to the Website, such as videos of the School District User.

A user may disable or adjust a browser's acceptance of cookies by looking within the settings and/or preferences within that user's web browser. Please note that if a user disables cookies, the user may not be able to take advantage of certain aspects of a website's interactive features. The Website also uses plug-ins.
