We will also use this information to undertake sales and marketing research and to tailor Our marketing campaigns and email communications specifically to you, and your recent activity on Our site.

It enables Us to understand how useful you find different sections of Our websites to be, so We can make Our websites and associated advertising/marketing appealing and relevant to as many users as possible.

You can tell Us about your preferences regarding how your Personal Information is used for marketing purposes, and review and change your marketing preferences at any time by visiting your Personal Account or emailing help@empora.com. As stated previously, if you decide to not disclose some information, you may be unable to use certain features on Our websites for example, in order to receive an email alert for a product price watch you are required to submit your email address.
We offer you the opportunity to receive information about exclusive promotions, special offers and other news from Us. Unless you tell Us otherwise We may use your purchase history to communicate information We think may interest you. We'll only do this by email, SMS and other similar forms of communication where We're letting you know about Our services and promotions or promotions and news from Our partner merchants if you've told Us that you'd like this to happen.
You can sign up for direct marketing by registering on this website. You will also be asked if you want to receive direct marketing if you set up a Personal Account or if you enter a competition or register for a promotion with any of Our websites. Your details may be shared within Our group websites. We will normally send direct marketing by email if We have your email address. We may send you offers on behalf of other businesses such as Our partner merchants. However, when We do so, We do not give the other business your name and contact details. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please notify Us by e-mail at help@empora.com. See Section 4 to read more about who your data can be disclosed to.
If you would like Us to stop sending direct marketing to you, We offer simple ways to do this. Whenever you receive direct marketing you will be told how to unsubscribe. In addition, if you have a Personal Account you can change your marketing preferences at any time by amending your membership profile online, or by telephoning or writing to Us (Contact Us). As the choices you make about your preferences and settings may not take effect immediately, it is possible you may receive a communication which you have requested not to receive during the period in which your request is being processed.
If you consented to receive marketing communications when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion you can tell Us that you do not wish to receive any more by writing, with your full name, address and other contact details (Contact Us)
If you tell Us that you do not wish to receive further direct marketing, We will continue to send you important information about your Personal Account and any relevant legal notices. Please note that if you do not wish to receive any legal notices from Us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of Our websites, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
From time to time We may run optional surveys. Surveys by or on behalf of Us are conducted in accordance with the Market Research Society and ICC/ESOMAR guidelines. These guidelines ensure that participation in any research is confidential and voluntary and that results do not identify individual respondents. For the purpose of surveys We may combine cookie or other data with your answers but We will ensure that this does not affect the anonymity of the results.
