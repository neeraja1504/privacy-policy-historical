The Full Detailed Privacy Policy
What Information Does the Service Collect?
Information You Provide to Us
Personal Information and Demographic Information. On the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, home address, and phone number (“ Personal Information ”); and (2) demographic information, such as information like your zip code (“ Demographic Information ”). Except to the extent required by applicable law, Demographic Information is “non-Personal Information” (i.e., data that is not treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy). In addition, as permitted by applicable law, Personal Information, once “de-identified” (i.e., the removal or modification of personally identifiable elements or the extraction of non-personally identifiable elements) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent any non-Personal Information is combined by or on behalf of Company with Personal Information Company itself collects directly from you on the Service, Company will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including when you schedule an in-home consultation/estimate, apply for a position with the Company, complete a survey, through “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, but if you choose not to provide certain information you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Service’s features.
We may also collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you call to schedule an in-home estimate or otherwise call our customer service center. This Privacy Policy generally does not apply to any information collected in these circumstances. However, if we combine Personal Information we collect from you offline with the Personal Information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

2. Information We Collect and Store as You Access and Use the Service
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“ Usage Information ”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ Device ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information may include:
* your IP address, UID or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
* your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
* the URL that referred you to our Service;
* the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
* your Device location;
* your Device characteristics; and
* certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“ Tracking Technologies ”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage and do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
Strictly Necessary. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of appointment scheduling functionality.
Performance‑Related. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Service, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.
Functionality‑Related. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Service, including identifying you when you sign‑in to our Service or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Service.
Targeting‑Related. We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Service and third‑party services based on how you interact with our advertisements or content. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our Service. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.

3. Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as our third party suppliers and data improvement and other service providers for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.

4. Interactions with Third-Party Services
The Service may now or in the future include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application.

For example, we may use third parties to facilitate e-mails, tweets, “likes,” content submissions or postings of comments on Facebook or other social media platforms. We may also enable access to or display of third party content via the Service, that is actually being served or published by the third party, and such third party may be collecting data from you in connection with that content.

Company may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. When you use third-party services, you are using their services and not our Services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.

2. Tracking Technologies Generally
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html . Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, Company currently does not alter Company’s practices when Company receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. Some third parties, however, may also offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser ( www.ghostery.com ), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. Company is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.

3. Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
Company may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other service providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Company analyze how users use the Service. Information generated by these services ( e.g. , your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and other service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.htmlunder the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you.”
Certain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at http://www.youradchoices.com/ and its opt-out program for mobile apps at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices . In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members’ ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect this and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads ( e.g. , from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. Company is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. However, Company supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ( http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf ) and expects that ad networks Company directly engages to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though Company cannot guaranty their compliance.
