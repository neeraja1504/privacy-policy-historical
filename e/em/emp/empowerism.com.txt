The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary for any billing, shipping, delivery, and general account questions. Personal information (described above) is collected for all customers.
The customer's telephone number and/or email address is used to conduct a follow-up call (or email). This call is made within 45 days of purchase by one of our coaches to find out if the customer is happy with his or her purchase and to offer a reminder of our free resources and support options. This is in no way a sales call; rather, it is part of our customer support.
