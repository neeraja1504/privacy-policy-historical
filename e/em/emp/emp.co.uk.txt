Funko is located in the UK (London) and depending on the outcome of the Brexit process will be located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") from March 29, 2019 onwards. In case of a hard Brexit the UK will be considered a country which does not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European data protection law perspective. We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law by basing the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority, approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of Funko. You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in the "Questions" section below.

After the transfer of your email address to Funko in October 2021 and if EMP no longer needs to use your email address for other purposes (as set out in our Website Privacy Policy), we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which EMP is subject).
