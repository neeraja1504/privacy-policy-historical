Cookies
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site.

We do not have access to any information about you from cookies you might receive from our ad networks while visiting our site.
For certain pages we also use a custom ad rotator which uses cookies to determine which ads you have seen already, so it may be able to avoid showing ads you've already seen. Information from this cookie is not used or stored for other purposes.

This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites.
