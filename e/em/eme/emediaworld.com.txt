eMediaWorld.com Privacy - eMediaWorld - Newswire Service - FreePressRelease
The following discloses our Privacy Policy...
What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the eMediaWorld, Inc. Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
What are cookies?
From time to time, eMediaWorld, Inc. or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system and are thus widely used throughout the internet by millions of businesses. We use cookies to identify which areas of eMediaWorld, Inc. Network of Web sites you have visited, used or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our web sites. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.
What other information do you request?
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists, account updates or information about new products and services). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.
In addition, eMediaWorld, Inc. will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new eMediaWorld, Inc. products and services. In many cases while ordering services you may be required to provide your postal or billing address. This information is never shared or given to outside third parties. It is only used in order to communicate with you directly about your account or other happenings at eMediaWorld, Inc. or their holdings. When you sign up for a eMediaWorld, Inc. forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the eMediaWorld, Inc. Network in any way. When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
What information do you collect when I purchase something?
If you are purchasing something from an eMediaWorld, Inc. property, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose without your express permission.
Certain eMediaWorld, Inc. properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other eMediaWorld, Inc. media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information.
In many instances when eMediaWorld, Inc. collects personal information, a reasonable effort is made to included a link to this Privacy Policy if applicable. Additionally, our privacy policy link is always available from our main web site at: http://www.eMediaWorld.com
