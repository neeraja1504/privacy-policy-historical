Emerson Network Power Privacy Policy
Overview
Emerson is aware of the need to address Internet privacy issues and we believe you should be aware of how we intend to treat any information about you that we might receive on the Internet as a result of your visit to the Site.
Information About Emerson On-Line Visitors
You can visit Emerson on the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors.
In general, we gather information about users of the Site collectively in order to determine, for example, which areas users access more frequently and which materials users access the most.
This information helps us to determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users by improving the content of the Site.
There are times however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. Customarily, the personal information Emerson obtains is used only to respond to inquiries, to process orders, for product registration, or to allow you to access specific account information.
We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information for market research such as your interests, demographics, and experience with our products.
Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses of those who provide information available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you may find interesting.
Cookies
Many sites use a technology called "cookies," where a Web site sends an element of data through your browser to your system. Some Emerson site pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, letting you decide whether to accept it.
Web Site Links
Emerson's Site may contain links to other Web sites such as Emerson distributors and sales representatives.
While Emerson tries to link only to sites that share its high standards and respect for privacy, Emerson cannot take responsibility for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.
Changes
If at any time Emerson changes its privacy commitment, Emerson will post those changes here so that you will know what information Emerson gathers and how Emerson might use that information.
