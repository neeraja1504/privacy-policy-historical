Privacy Policy | Embark
Last updated: May 5th, 2018
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement with immediate effect.
Embark Corp (“Company,” “we,” “us”) is dedicated to ensuring data privacy and security for our users. We are fully committed to adhering to all global security and privacy frameworks governing the usage of our service by applicants and other types of users, including:
European General Data Protection Regulation (see addendum)
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles
US Federal and State regulations
You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, when you access or use our Website (embark.com) or share personal information with us.
1. Information We Collect
A. What you share with us
We collect information about you when you voluntarily provide us with information through school, fellowship, financial aid, or other Website forms. The information you may be requested to submit by our school and fellowship clients may include (but is not limited to): (1) Name, (2) Address, (3) Email Address, (4) Telephone Number, (5) Social Security Number [for US applicants], and (6) Date of Birth.  We also might receive information from your communications with us through our Website, email or telephone. Should you explicitly indicate interest in a third-party product or service featured on our site, we will track your interest in this service.
B. What is automatically collected
For the purposes of improving our system performance, we may collect non-personally identifiable information such as your IP address (think of it as your address on the Internet so we can assess volume by country/region), cookies ( a small text file that Web sites can place on your hard drive to help remember your Username, as an example), computer settings (for example, what browser you are using), or analytics stats gathered by web tracking software.
C. Information provided by a Third Party Provider
As a benefit to our users, we integrate with third-party sites that provide information. An example would be an integration with Facebook so users can choose to log in via existing Facebook credentials instead of creating Embark credentials.
2. Use of information
We may share some or all of the information we collect, as described above, with affiliated organizations and companies and with third parties (i.e. non-affiliated companies).
Examples include sharing your data with the following:
the institution or organization to which you are applying
third-party service providers that can perform a service on your behalf, e.g. test score verification or our support ticketing platform for tracking applicant questions
third-party service providers where you have indicated an explicit interest in their services
third-party service providers as required by law, for example in response to a regulatory inquiry
Note that third-party web sites will operate under their own privacy policy, and users must choose whether to accept those terms.  In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Embark is potentially liable. Embark’s liability under this agreement will be governed by the contract in place between Embark and the third party, and the event giving rise to the damage.
3. Your Privacy Choices
Embark currently operates on a strict “opt-in” basis prior to sharing information with unaffiliated third parties not central to completing the application process. We consider this unlikely to change but, should we ever find a valid user benefit to shifting away from this model, we would provide the opportunity for users to “opt-out” via an unsubscribe link or contacting the support team.
4. Security
Embark takes your security seriously. While perfect security on the Internet is impossible to promise, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information you provide to us. We restrict access to this information to employees with a need to know this information to provide you with the benefit, assistance or service you request or would like to obtain, and to those employees that need the information to do their jobs.
5. Minors
Embark responds responsibly to site visitors who are minors and its application generally target an older audience. We adhere to US federal and state laws regarding visitors under 18 years of age (COPPA).
6. Data Access, Correction, and Removal
Individuals may access their data through the Embark portal using their unique login. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you can correct, update, or delete the information you have provided to us by contacting us at support at embark.com.
7. Contacting the Website
If you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact us directly at privacypolicy@embark.com.
