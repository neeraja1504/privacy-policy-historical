"Personal Data" refers to any data that allows us (regardless of whether we do this or not) to identify you (the "User") as a natural person.
Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you:
What information we collect and why.
How we use and share that information.
How you can access and update that information.
By using the Service, you give your consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data and other information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into Emilyate's Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via email.
Information we collect about you
In general we may collect Personal Data, including Sensitive Data, and other information. Sensitive Data includes information, comments or content (e.g. photos, videos, profile, lifestyle) that you optionally provide that may reveal your ethnic origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing Sensitive Data to us, you give consent to the collection, use and disclosure thereof as permitted by applicable privacy laws. We may also collect your geolocation information with your consent. By using the Service, you authorize us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service.

Please note that we may store the first six and the last four digits of your credit card number as envisaged by the Payment Card Industry Security Data Standard ("PCI DSS") to help us identify any possible credit card fraud or other illegal behaviour. That will help us to quickly resolve any issues that may arise in connection with payment processing, making chargebacks and refunds.

Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.
Data retention
We keep your information only for as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. If you close your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to the policies of those third parties.
Security measures
We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
