Information Sharing and Disclosure.
We may share your information for the following purposes:
Service Providers. We may share your information with service providers that help us deliver the services you request, such as credit card processors, advertisers, analytics providers, data management services, web hosting, and web development. We furnish service providers with the information needed for them to perform these services, however, each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved.
Legal Purposes. We may share your information when we believe in good faith that such sharing is reasonably necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities or to comply with legal process.  We may also share your information in situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service; or to respond to the claims of violation of the rights of third parties and/or to protect the rights, property and safety of Emagine, our employees, users, or the public. This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations.
Business Transactions. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.  You may have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information in any other circumstances where we have your consent.
Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising
** Online Analytics .   **We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those provide by Google Analytics.  These service providers use the sort of technology described in the Automatically-Collected Information section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive.  The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.  To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by clicking here.
** Tailored Online Advertising .   **Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve advertising content based on past visits to our Services and other sites and (ii) report how our advertising content impressions, other uses of advertising services, and interactions with these advertising impressions and services are related to visits to our Services. We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks, servers and platform) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services or on other websites or in other mobile applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed by such third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link  and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.  In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests.  Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Information Access.
Through your account settings, you may access and, in some cases, change information in your profile.  The information you can view and update through your account settings may change as the Services change.
How We Protect Information.
We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to your information and to maintain data security. These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.  Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of or access to your information, the Internet and the Services are not 100% secure so we cannot guarantee that your information we collect or store will be protected from all unauthorized access or disclosure and thereby used in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
Communication Choices.
Information collected on our Services is used for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, and is subject to the choices discussed throughout this Privacy Policy.  We provide opt-out information in all commercial email messages via an “unsubscribe” link.  Please note that it may take us some time to process your requests consistent with applicable law.  You do not have the ability to opt-out of non-commercial communications that we send if you are enrolled in our rewards or membership programs or if you have engaged in transactions with us (such as service announcements and administrative or informational messages).
Linked Sites and Services.
Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, including social media services. Your use of these features may result in the collection, processing or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites or services which may be linked on our Services. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or services. The information you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We strongly encourage you to read such third parties’ privacy policies.
Children.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to use the Services or send any us any information.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verified parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us using the contact information below.
