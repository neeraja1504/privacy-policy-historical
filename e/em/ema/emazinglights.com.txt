We need to share information with our shipping partners so they can get your order to the right doorstep. We only work with highly respected delivery services like USPS, FedEx, UPS and DHL and share as little personal information as possible.
Payment Processing
We use third party payment processing providers in order to take payments securely. This keeps your sensitive credit card and other payment information safe. We do not store your credit card information on our site.

We work with credit card reference and fraud detection companies to ensure the safety of our customers and our business from fraud crimes. This allows us to cancel fraudulent orders before the victim is affected.
