Privacy Policy • Hunter
User accounts
All the data of your account is yours. When you create your account, we ask information like your email, you name or what company your work for. All this information is used to personalize your experience or send you onboarding emails and invoices. This basic information about your account is only accessible to the team and will never be shared with third parties.
Sensitive data that results from your use of the product like the searches you do on Hunter, the files you upload or the data accessible via connected applications will only be accessed by the team with your permission to help you with a problem or squash a software bug.
The data we collect on the web
Hunter crawls the entire web and indexes all the email addresses it can find. All the email addresses can be directly distributed in the service with an indication of the place they have been found ("sources"). They can also be used in our algorithm to guess other email addresses.
There are some cases where we don’t collect or distribute these email addresses:
Our crawler follows the robots.txt files. Commonly used for search engines, robots.txt files are used on a website to indicate what pages should be read or not by crawlers. In clear, if a website owner doesn’t wish some pages to be read, we don’t.
We never distribute webmail email addresses, like Gmail or Yahoo. Hunter is designed for professional use only.
Whenever a professional asks for his information to be removed from our database.
Chrome extension
Hunter’s Chrome extension lets you use our services directly through the Chrome browser.
When you use Chrome
While you use the Chrome extension, we collect non-identifying information regarding your browsing including the country of visit, the time of visit and the domain names visited. The data is collected in an anonymized fashion. This helps us identify the most popular websites and helps us to improve the service with this information. You can deactivate this data collection in the extension’s options. We don’t collect any identifying information such as your IP address.
On LinkedIn
Hunter’s extension can read and modify pages on LinkedIn’s website. On LinkedIn, Hunter’s extension only reads data required to ensure the extension’s functionalities, such as finding the email address of profiles or saving leads. We never store data of profiles unless you explicitly want to do so (i.e. save them as leads).
MailTracker
Hunter edits another extension, MailTracker. It lets you track the emails you send with Gmail. The extension integrates into Gmail and needs to connect with your Google account. We use the fact that an email address is deliverable or not using MailTracker to improve Hunter's email-finding algorithm. We use it to improve the pattern detections and confidence scores on email addresses already present in our base, but never distribute an email address that has been found this way. We never use or store the content of the emails.
Google Sheets Add-on
The Google Sheets Add-on only modifies your Google spreadsheets to return email addresses. It never modifies them unless you ask to do so by launching an enrichment. It never stores any information contained in your spreadsheets.
Security
All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. We work with security researchers to continuously improve the overall security of Hunter. We go to great length to secure your data. You can read more on our Security Policy.
Analytics
In all our products, we may track actions done by our users to improve the service. We'll track these actions for statistical purposes, for example, to know the popularity of a feature or the conversion rate of a page. This data is only accessible by the team.
Updates & contact
Hunter may update this policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by displaying a prominent notice on our site.
You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time in your dashboard, or if it’s not directly possible, by contacting our support team.
Do you have questions about this privacy policy? Please get in touch. We’ll be happy to answer them!
