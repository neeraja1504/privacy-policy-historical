Browser Extension
We do not have full control over the email account of the user, we just receive access to the email client that the user is using to compose their email for the sole purpose of adding in their HTML email signature. The email client controls the events that create and edit the email. When one of these events is occurring, our extension inserts their HTML email signature in a particular position, the users text in the email is not being analyzed or collected and is not being transferred to us in any way. Our browser extension just locates the correct tag in order to correctly insert the HTML email signature in the correct position when composing, replying or forwarding their email.
Our API is used to connect our browser extension with the HTML email signature website app esig.ly. The browser extension sends a request to our system with the unique key that the user is asked to insert, the user obtains this key by securely logging into our website app with their authorised account. The system checks if the request is correct, it then identifies the signature in the system by the corresponding key and inserts the signature into the browser extension. The signature key is unique to that specific signature only ensuring the correct details are pulled into the browser extension. Again, no email letter text is being analyzed or transferred anywhere during this key transmission.
