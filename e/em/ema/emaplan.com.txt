Except as described in this Policy, eMoney will not give, sell, rent or loan any personally identifiable information to any third party.
Personally identifiable information does not include “ Usage Data ” which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data (such as IP addresses) we collect about a group or category of services, features or users, which does not contain personally identifiable information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Site so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Site. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve the Site as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you.
If you make a written request via the Site for us to contact you or to subscribe to our online wealth planning system (the “ System “), we may use that personally identifiable information you provide in order to contact and communicate with you about the Site and your potential interest in subscribing to our System, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Site and/or the System. You can choose not to receive future e-mails from eMoney at any time, by contacting our customer service (see Section 9 below). However, to the extent that corrected or deleted information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases. Please note that we may occasionally contact you for administrative purposes even if you unsubscribe from our distribution lists.
We may also share your personally identifiable information with third-party service providers (such as credit card processors and application functionality partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Site and System and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personally identifiable information you provide for their marketing purposes.
We accept inquiries and applications regarding our open job postings through the Site. This may include resume files. Personally identifiable information submitted by job applicants when applying for a position is only used for the purpose of evaluating the candidate for a position at eMoney and is managed according to our human resources department policies.

A “cookie” is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Site and other information, which we consider to be of interest to you. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users’ computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include personally identifiable information.
When you use the Site we utilize “session cookies,” which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser or turn off your computer.

Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your web browser or turn off your computer.
We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.
Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Site. We use these cookies to keep a user logged into the Site and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Site.
