This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect and how the Company may use this information.
Cookies
Emailvision uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, Emailvision’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Emailvision, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact” or a “Free Campaign Commander™ Demo” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based.
Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. If you have chosen to identify yourself to Emailvision, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Emailvision uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service.

In all instances, Emailvision will obtain access to EU Personal Data about End Users in the course of operating Web sites, providing contractually obligated services, and providing customer care and other related services. Such data may include, name, billing address, business address, email address, telephone number, , and other information, depending on the particular Client, Web site or other application or service at issue. In all instances, Emailvision will not share, sell, rent or trade with third parties for promotional purposes any personal data processed by Emailvision, unless Emailvision is directed to do so by a Client who owns such personal data.

Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their Campaign Commander™ usernames and passwords.
10. Children’s Protection
We do not collect, use, or disclose information from children under the age of 13.

When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. Emailvision also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Emailvision also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.
