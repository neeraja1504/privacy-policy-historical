Episode Interactive, LLC Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 28, 2016
Introduction and Your Agreement to this Privacy Policy
Episode Interactive, LLC (“Episode Interactive”, “us”, “our” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users (“users”, “your”, or “you”). This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect in connection with our mobile application, “Episode”, websites located at http://episode-app.com, http://episodeinteractive.com and http://pg-story.appspot.com (collectively, together with any other websites controlled by Episode Interactive, the “Sites”) or any Episode Interactive game or application provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the “Service”). Personal information can include, for example, an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected or received by Episode Interactive through your use of the Service. Episode Interactive is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.
BY INSTALLING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICE. We may update this Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Policy. We will post all changes to this Policy on this page and the modified policy will specify its effective date.
Information Collected and Used
Our primary objective in collecting your information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable you to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. For example, Episode Interactive may use your information to register your account, provide customer support, resolve disputes, collect fees, connect users, and notify you of updates to the game (or of other/new games) and special promotions.
iOS or Android Platforms
When you use any of the Episode Interactive games or applications, we may automatically collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID, MAC address, advertising identifier, OpenUDID, IMEI number, hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your in-game activity, and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address). This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends. It may also be used to contact you with in-game technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages.
Finally, we may use this information to customize the user experience and promotions, enforce our terms of service, and make recommendations about user connections.
We may also give users the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates. You may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device. A user’s location may be used to suggest friends with whom they might want to connect, analyze usage trends or target certain promotions.
Some of our games or applications may permit a user to record his or her voice and share such recordings with an opponent in the context of such game or application. Episode Interactive may use these recordings and post them as well as the contents of your play sessions on Facebook on a publicly available page (and link your data with your opponent). Episode Interactive may store these recordings on its servers.
Google Server
Google is our application engine service provider. Any information provided through our applications is available to Google as part of Google providing this service.
Platforms/Third-Party Marketplaces
In the course of providing our Service on third party platforms/marketplaces, such as Apple’s App Store, the platforms/marketplaces may collect information about you or receive information from us in order for the platforms/marketplaces to provide or analyze their services. Please note that these platforms/marketplaces were developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Episode Interactive and that Episode Interactive is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies. You should carefully review the terms of service and privacy policies of the platforms/third-party marketplaces that you use to access our Service.

A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a Episode Interactive game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.
We may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which deliver cookies to your computer so the ads you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Web Beacons
We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used on our Site or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Episode Interactive does not share your personal information except as approved by you or as described below:
With your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies.
Episode Interactive may engage other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf. Examples of these services include sending e-mails to you and analyzing data.
We may release your information as permitted by law or when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our rights; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our users, or others.

Third Party Tools/Analytics
The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from third party service providers, which may enable these third parties to analyze our users’ information. These third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Episode Interactive.
Advertisements
You may see our games advertised in other applications or websites. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of the Service. A device identifier and in game or user session activity may be shared with the advertiser.
We may use a third-party ad tracking service, MobileAppTracking, for tracking installs resulting from advertisements on other applications or sites. Please visit http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/ to see what type of information MobileAppTracking is collecting and using. You may opt out of such tracking by visiting https://optoutmobile.com/optOut. If you choose to opt out by visiting such web address, that action is specific to the tracking for such third party ad tracking.
You may see an “offer wall” displayed in our games that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall enables advertisers to provide virtual currency to you in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer with one of those advertisers. The offer wall providers may collect information about you, including a device identifier, device type, device brand, device model, OS type/version, network type, device language, device locale, and IP address. In addition, the offer wall provider may collect information related to the performance of the advertisements such as how many times an advertisement is shown, how long an advertisement is viewed, and any click-throughs of an advertisement.
In addition, Episode Interactive may have advertisements in its games regarding other applications or services that are served by third parties. These third parties may collect and use information about you, including platform, application and OS version, device identifiers, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Service user session activity, device usage information and general location information, such as locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), mobile network code/mobile country code, and time zone, to show advertising of interest to you. For example, Facebook serves advertising in certain of our applications and may target such advertisements based on information Facebook has collected from you. You can opt-out of such targeted advertisements by using Apple’s “Limit Ad Tracking” setting described here. You can opt-out of interest based ads served by InMobi by downloading and using the Truste Ad Privacy Manager mobile application. Certain video ads are displayed in our games that are served by partners such as Ad Colony, Flurry, Applovin and Vungle and which may target users based on certain information that such third party has obtained regarding users. You can opt out of Ad Colony targeted advertising by visiting http://privacy.adcolony.com/opt-out, can opt out of Flurry targeted advertising by visiting http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html, opt out of Applovin targeted advertising by following the instructions at https://www.applovin.com/optout, and opt out of Vungle targeted advertising by following the instructions available here http://www.vungle.com/privacy/.
