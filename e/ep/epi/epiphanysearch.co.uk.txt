Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools
We use several modern marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.
Jaywing may work with third party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about our Products and Services on our website and across the internet. To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time, which helps cater advertising that is delivered to you. Examples of this may include an advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. You can opt-out of these personalised ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you.
If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest-based advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.
Recruitment
You may wish to share personal information with Jaywing regarding employment opportunities. As part of the recruitment process, we may ask for your permission to hold your personal information.
