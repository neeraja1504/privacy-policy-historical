This privacy policy addresses the online privacy practices of Cricket Media Services, Inc., formerly known as ePals, Inc., and its affiliated entities, including its subsidiaries, Cricket Media, Inc. and In2Books, Inc., for the website services and/or products indicated herein (collectively, “Cricket”). Cricket is committed to protecting the privacy of children, students, parents, educators and e-mentors, while providing students and schools with a dynamic learning and teaching environment made possible by the Internet and made available through its ePals® global learning community (hereinafter “ePals”) and/or through its online student e-mentoring programs, CricketTogether™ and TryEngineering Together™ (the latter program is offered in conjunction with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated, “IEEE”) .
This Privacy Policy explains how Cricket collects and uses information from users of its websites, Products and services, including ePals, CricketTogether, TryEngineering Together, Challenges and/or similar contests involving or related to ePals or Cricket’s magazines, and in2Books’ learning programs (individually and collectively, “Services”), and in connection with its sale of Cricket’s magazine subscriptions and related products (collectively “Products”), including our treatment of personally identifiable information.
If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services, and disclose information to us with your parent’s (or guardian’s) consent. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent (or guardian). You may only order Products from any sites if you are 18 years of age or older or authorized to order, and have a valid credit card to purchase or where indicated on a particular site.
IF YOU USE THE SERVICES, THE PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO YOU.
As you will see from reviewing this Privacy Policy, we take your privacy seriously. By accessing or using the Services (including via mobile devices) or accessing shop.cricketmedia.com and ordering Products, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy; and for certain Services such as CricketTogether or TryEngineering Together, your use may be subject to participation guidelines and permissions that may be imposed by a child’s teacher or school administrator.

PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program
Cricketmedia.com, CricketTogether, TryEngineering Together (a joint program between Cricket Media and IEEE, and administered by Cricket Media on behalf of IEEE and program sponsors), the ePals Global Community, and the Challenges, are members of the PRIVO’s PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program (“the Program”). As a participating member in the Program, Cricket Media Services, Inc. adheres to the strict information collection, use and disclosure requirements set forth by the Program. PRIVO is an independent, third-party organization committed to safeguarding children’s personal information collected online. PRIVO aims to help parents and their children exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. The PRIVO certification seal posted on this page indicates that Cricket Media Services, Inc. has established COPPA compliant privacy practices and has agreed to submit to PRIVO’s oversight and consumer dispute resolution process. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at (703) 885-3400 or support@cricketmedia.com. If you have further concerns after you have contacted us, you can contact PRIVO directly at privacy@privo.com.
This Privacy Policy covers all users and is applicable to all of the Services and Product purchases.
When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information. When we refer to “Child Related Personal Information,” we mean personally identifiable information of minors (i.e. persons under the age of 18). General references to “information” are to information that does not and could not reasonably be used by us to identify an individual.
I. PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CHILDREN UNDER 16
Cricket limits the collection of personal information from children to only that which is necessary to obtain parental consent or to participate in a Cricket program or activity after we and/or participating schools (in the case of CricketTogether™ and TryEngineering Together™) have obtained parental consent. If you are under age 16, you are not allowed to subscribe to any of the Services or create an account without the permission of your parent, guardian, or teacher. In addition to the required consent, it is a good idea to request assistance from your parent or legal guardian in setting up your account, for online Challenges, contests or other activities, if any, for which there is an account associated with use of a particular Service, or your teacher with respect to setting up your account for ePals®. For certain one-time contests, an email for your parent/legal guardian may be requested.
Parental Consent (and Teacher and Guardian Consent)
We require a parent or guardian to consent before a child under the age of 16 can become a member of the ePals Global Community, as discussed below, or to use any of the Services offered by Cricket. During any such registration process, we only collect limited personal information (i.e., parent’s name and email address) for the purposes of obtaining a parent’s permission for his/her child to participate in the particular Service, including Challenges or to obtain a prize in connection with certain contests, or become a member of the ePals Global Community (“ePals®”).
If we receive consent from a teacher (including those parent[s] involved in home schooling) or school administrator, your child’s ePals membership will be activated.
What Information Do We Collect From Children?
Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect the following types of personal information directly from children: date of birth and parent email address in order to notify the parent and obtain consent. We may collect the following information from parents or teachers about a child: first name, last name, password, nickname, IP address, grade level, gender, mailing address and parent’s name and email address.
We may also passively collect, through Users’ computers, mobile phones or other wireless devices and we also collect personally identifiable information through cookies from children’s computers. In connection with activities such as contests/Challenges, we do collect and share children’s images, audio and video submitted through such contest or Challenge but only after full parental consent has been obtained. Children are able to post on forums on the ePals Global Community (or in certain instances in connection with a teacher’s activation of CricketTogether or TryEngineering Together) but such content is moderated and any personally identifiable information is removed and deleted before posting. In some instances, that is, only as between classrooms in the ePals Global Community may a teacher exchange photos/videos for use in the online projects but not otherwise publicly available.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our site, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used, the type of operating system used, the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit.
How Do We Use the Information We Collect From Children?
Use of Personally Identifiable Information:
We may use the personally identifiable information that we collect from a child: (1) to determine whether he or she is eligible to use the Services; (2) to obtain consent from his or her parent, teacher or school administrator, as applicable, for the child to use the Services; (3) to provide an interactive online experience; (4) to provide customization and content recommendations; (5) to provide educational content that we believe that the child may be interested in or would
benefit from; (6) to fulfill requests for products.
Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
We may use non-personally identifiable information (such as cookies and Web surfing habits associated with IP addresses) to improve the design, content and performance of the Services, including in the case of the CricketTogether product through surveys which results may be shared with educational consultants engaged by Cricket Media, or in the case of TryEngineering Together with IEEE and entities that may be sponsoring TryEngineering Together programs in schools. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage and the popularity of the Services (individually or collectively).
Will Cricket Share My Child’s Personal Information with Third Parties?
We may disclose personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information in certain limited circumstances, as set forth in Section III below.
We or teachers or administrators (in connection with Services utilized by teachers or other program administrators with authority to engage participating students such as ePals or CricketTogether or TryEngineering Together), moderate all user generated content to remove any personally identifiable information unless, as is the case of contests or Challenges, we have parent permission to share this publicly, including on our websites. However, while we take all reasonable steps, where applicable, to ensure that children do not share their personal information no system is foolproof.
Can I Review, Change or Delete the Child Related Personal Information Cricket has Collected from My Child?
Yes, you can. You can review the Child Related Personal Information related to your child by making a request, as described below, at any time. You can also have the Child Related Personal Information related to your child deleted as described below and end authorization for further collection of such information by us. If you wish to view, delete or modify information:
For ePals®: Members of ePals can review or edit, any Child Related Personal Information related to their child (such as the child’s name, phone number, email or postal address) by logging in to ePals and going to the preferences or settings page. Parents can also request that a child’s account, including those set up by an authorized teacher, be deleted at any time by emailing support@cricketmedia.com.
For CricketTogether™ or TryEngineering Together™: Teachers can log into their accounts on https://crickettogether.com or https://tryengineeringtogether.com, click the “My Class” button in the navigation bar, and update information about a child.

As a parent, you should consult your school’s acceptable use policy for more information about your child’s school’s policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. As a teacher or school administrator, you should confirm that you have authority to consent on behalf of your student’s parents, by reviewing your school’s acceptable use policy and any express consents provided by parents or guardians to students’ online activities, together with Cricket’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
Teachers may provide consent electronically when creating accounts for their students. Parent consent is required before a student’s content or information is shared outside of the school context.
CricketTogether™ verifies the teacher who has created the account for the school by receiving written consent and agreement from the school principal.
If you are a student under 16, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us unless (and until) you have first obtained consent from your parent,
guardian or authorized teacher, and please do not send any personal information other than the limited information we request from you in connection with the Services.

area), provided, however, that the profile would be accessible if such teacher asks to join another teacher’s project or submits a project to the Join Project listing.
It is our policy not to create profiles for any user identified by our system as being under 16 years old or identified as a student.

We ask such service providers to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them.

What does Cricket use my information for?
Generally
When you use certain of the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending upon what category of User you are registered as within ePals (e.g., student, parent or teacher, or for CricketTogether or TryEngineering Together mentor) (“User Category”), and as permitted by the functionality of the Services.

For additional information about the security measures we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at support@cricketmedia.com.
The Services contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for security on other sites. (We recommend that you read all third parties’ privacy policies to ensure you understand them). This Privacy Policy only governs information collected by Cricket for the Services and Products.
VII. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time for any reason. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
If we make changes to this Policy, we will post the revised Policy here with a new effective date at the top. Please check back to this page periodically. One way to know that the Policy has changed is to look at the effective date at the top of this privacy policy to see if it has changed.
If we make material changes in the way we collect, use or disclose Personal Information or Child Related Personal Information, we will notify you either: (i) via email prior to the effective date of the change; or (ii) by posting an announcement on the Services with two (2) weeks’ notice prior to the effective date of the change.
VIII. USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
When you use the Services or order Products, the information we collect about you, including personal information, will be processed in the United States, as Cricket’s servers are all located in the United States. The data protection and other privacy laws of the United States may not afford the same level of protection as the laws of certain other countries. By providing personal information to Cricket from outside the United States, whether directly or indirectly though the Services or otherwise, you expressly consent to the transfer of your information to the United States, in accordance with the measures of protection described in this Privacy Policy.
