Information We Collect From You
Our site's registration process may require users to give us contact information (like name and email address) and unique identifiers (like social security number or tax identification number). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. We use it to complete and support your purchases from and use of the Web site, to comply with any requirements of law, and to respond to any questions you might have.

This information will not reveal your identity or be linked to you personally. We use this information to support your use of the Web site, to comply with any requirements of law, and to determine the commissions for our Affiliates. This data may be disclosed to third parties in aggregate only with no personally identifiable information ever being disclosed to affiliates.
Your Email Address and Communication With You
We do not rent, sell, or otherwise disclose your email address to third parties. We do not Spam (send advertising emails or solo ads) our users.

An email address is required to place a classified ad or auction, reply to an ad or auction, use the feedback system, sign up for a SearchAlert, or participate in our Affiliate program.
We send a monthly email to all users. This monthly email will contain updates, news, and special offers, as well as information about your account.

If you do not want to receive this monthly email, you can opt-out from a link in the email as well as from your account page.

We send you email on a user's behalf when they reply to your ad. We strive to intercept unwanted replies to ads, but we take no responsibility for the content of any reply you get. Your contact information, including email address is not disclosed to browsers unless you expressly enter it into the ad for the public to see. We have a procedure for you to report unwanted replies to us as part of the email. Do not report any email we send you to authorities as Spam or your account priviledges may be terminated.
We send regular account reminders to all users who have outstanding balances.

Your IP Address
Your IP address is transmitted to each web server every time you make a request. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.
Our Use of Cookies
Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences. They cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personal or private information.
If you take out an ad on EPage Network Classifeds or become an affiliate we use temporary cookies to help format the page, and indicate what ads you can view. We also place permanent cookies to enable some of the advanced benefits, such as viewing all ads, for Gold members. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
Most cookies expire after a certain time period. The most popular browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, can be set to give you the option of accepting or rejecting all cookies.
To use many of our services, your browser will need to be configured to accept cookies. Here's how to do it: In Netscape Navigator, click the Edit menu and select Preferences from the browser's drop-down menu. In the tree structure, click Advanced (Netscape 4) or Privacy & Security (Netscape 7). Under Cookies, you can slect the option you feel most comfortable with that enables cookies. In Internet Explorer, click the View (older versions of Explorer) or Tools (current version) menu and select Internet Options from the drop-down menu. Click the Advanced tab, scroll to the Security heading, and select the option you feel most comfortable with that enables cookies.
If you wish, you may set your browser to reject all cookies and still view the site. Because our system requires cookies for many processes, you may find that you are unable to place an ad or perform other tasks.
Exceptional Disclosures
We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, or EPage has good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on EPage; or (2) to protect and defend the property or rights of EPage, the users of its website or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk protection. If EPage should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on the EPage website to a third party or share your personal information with the company we merge with.
Third Party Notice
This site contains links to other sites. EPage wants you to be aware that when you click on links (including advertising banners), which take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to such third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third parties, including without limitation actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information by third parties.
EPage serves and receives ads from third party sites (our affiliates). Information not displayed in the ad (and thus not available to the general public via the Web) is not made available to these third party participants.
EPage uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising companies also may separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used, please go to:

Future Use
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
Site Security
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site.
Credit Card Security
The Internet is a vast network of computers. Because the data passes from computer to computer, some Internet shoppers worry that unauthorized persons may intercept the data and gain access to credit card numbers, but shopping on a secure site is actually safer than handing a credit card to a waiter in a restaurant. Taking the steps below will lower the chances of interception of your credit card number:
Limit your online shopping to Internet merchants, such as us, with sites equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL prevents unauthorized people from intercepting your data.
Use a browser that supports SSL. These browsers show a symbol in the status bar, such as a key or lock, when you are on a site that uses SSL. Most banks will cover the cost of fraud resulting from unauthorized use of your credit card or may limit your liability.
Credit card information collected is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer before it is transmitted over the Internet.
We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities, and may in our sole discretion disclose Personal Information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the right to release Personal Information or other information about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe in our sole discretion that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the Web site, or to protect the rights or property of EPage, its affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, or employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful.
