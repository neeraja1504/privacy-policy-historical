Privacy Policy - EWWW Image Optimizer
We do not rent, sell, or share your information with anyone else. Your information may be stored in systems that we do not own in the course of necessary business. The list below is current as of 06/2017.
Your credit card information:
This is the most sensitive data we handle. In fact, we technically don’t handle it. When you purchase something on our site, card information is sent directly to Stripe, a secure payment processor. This is done using a JavaScript request directly from your browser to Stripe. It is not routed through our server, and thus is never stored on our server. Ever.
If you use PayPal, they send us your name or business name, and your email address, which is no more than you’ve already provided at checkout.
Your physical address:
We don’t actually need your physical address, other than your country and zip/postal code, but when you sign up for a subscription, the software we use asks for it anyway. If you refresh the page, it will only require your country and zip. This is for validating your credit card information.
Our back-end database will store any address information you provide for the purpose of displaying it on your invoices. I have no intention of sending you mail, sorry if you were hoping for a letter!
Your email address:
We use Mail Chimp for all on-boarding emails and for sending you News & Updates. The on-boarding subscription is automatic, but you may unsubscribe if you don’t like free stuff. The News & Updates is optional, and can be toggled at checkout. You can also signup for the newsletter via the sidebar widget on our site.
We make use of an Abandoned Cart email workflow provided by Carthook. If you start the checkout process, enter your email, and then leave the page, you will be automatically subscribed to a series of emails attempting to woo you back. You may stop this campaign at any time, and if you complete the checkout, the campaign will normally be stopped.
When you make a purchase, your email will be stored at ewww.io as part of your user account. This allows you to manage your purchased products, license keys, invoices, etc.
Additionally, your email address is recorded in the API system database, so that automated service notifications can be sent to you. There is no opt-out on these, as it is purely transactional email: license activation, low credit notifications, and subscription reminders.
Other stuff:
We use Google Analytics, which means that cookies are used to collect non-identifying information. This is transmitted to servers in the United States owned by Google.
If you submit a question via the contact form or the help button, it will capture similar information and the page you are viewing. This helps so that I don’t tell you to go read something you already saw. Hopefully…
All our servers are hosted in the United States. That means the files you submit for optimization will travel to the US, be optimized, sent back to you, and then deleted from our servers. The only time they are stored is if you enable the backup option. Then the files are stored for 30 days, and deleted.
We do everything we can to ensure that no one else sees any of this information. If someone ever does hack our servers, we’ll be in touch…
If you have other questions about information not covered here, send us an email and we’ll be glad to clarify.
