At Visionworks of America, Inc. (“Visionworks”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of this website (the “Site”) (we refer to the Site and the services made available through the Site collectively as the “Site Features”). As such, we have established this Privacy Policy so that you can know our practices regarding the collection and use of information about visitors to the Site. The Site is intended to provide information and a number of different services to assist you in evaluating and shopping for various products sold by Visionworks.

By visiting the Site or using any of the Site Features, your consent to Visionworks’ collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.

Visionworks does not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it to us. We do, however, collect certain types of information and ask for personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you set up a User Account, use the Frame Finder™ service, request custom alerts and notifications regarding particular products and product categories, indicate your favorite products, and search for products on the Site. The following sections describe the type of information we collect and how we collect it.

We will not collect PII from you while you use the Site Features unless you voluntarily provide it to us or authorize us to collect such information. When you complete a registration form to create a User Account, we require you to provide us with relevant PII.
2. ### Cookies.
Like many websites, we employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide information that is targeted to your interests and make your online experience more convenient (for instance, by reducing the number of times you have to re-enter your password). Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on your hard drive. We may use cookies or similar tools to learn about your preferences and Internet session information, to record information including your likely state of residence, the web pages that you access and for how long, whether you return to the Site, and whether a particular email is opened. We do not receive or record any personal information in the cookies we use and are never tied to anything that could be used to identify you. We may encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you may choose to change your browser to block cookies that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session and you are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. You can still use the Site if your browser is set to reject cookies.
