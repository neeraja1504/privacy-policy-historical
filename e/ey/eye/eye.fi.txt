Content
If you transfer photos, videos and related EXIF data (collectively, "Content") directly between Eyefi cards and cameras and other supported devices, which may include computers, smartphones, or tablets, Eyefi does not transfer such Content to, or store such Content on, Eyefi servers. However, when you use many other Product features, such as synchronization, storage, sharing, relayed uploads, hotspot services, and other services we may offer now or in the future, that use often can involve transferring Content to and storing Content on Eyefi servers for access by you and others authorized by you.
Eyefi handles your Content the same as other Personal Information described in this privacy policy.
Accessing and updating your Personal Information
If you allow Eyefi Products to access your Content or other Personal Information, which you have stored in third party products and services, you will need to manage that Personal Information through your third party accounts. We do not have the ability to modify or delete your Personal Information stored in third party products and services.
If you believe Eyefi is in possession of your Personal Information that you want modified or deleted, you may make changes or delete your account at your discretion, directly through our web site. Or you may send an email request to privacy@eyefi.com. We may need to retain some Personal Information for the period of time necessary for legal proceedings, legal requirements or for settling your account, and some copies of your Personal Information may remain in our backups.

In some instances, Eyefi may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the "Cookies" section below for more information.
In addition, by using some of our Products, anonymous network information may be transmitted back to us such as Product usage information. This information is transmitted back to us so we can determine how users are interacting with our Products, to assist us with improving our Products, and to correct any problems that may occur.
Sharing your personal information
We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.
We may share your Personal Information within Eyefi and with third party service providers for purposes of managing your accounts, providing Products, or assisting in transactions, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, storing Content, and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with Personal Information which is necessary to provide or complete the requested Product or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use your Personal Information except for limited purpose of providing and completing the requested Product or transaction.
If you use sharing features of our Products, we will share your Personal Information as needed to perform the sharing functions you request. But we don't have any control over what the people, services, or third-party websites you've shared with do with your Personal Information after that.
We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We may collect and possibly share Personal Information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Eyefi's terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.
We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order to let us know your preferences, we will require an action on your part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate your consent.
Security of your Personal Information
Eyefi is committed to protecting the Personal Information you share with us. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit over the Internet. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, do not use the same password for multiple web sites, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.
Cookies
Like many websites, Eyefi uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.
A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.
In addition, Eyefi uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. Disabling cookies on your computer may cause Eyefi web pages to be inaccessible, inoperable or may disable some features. For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools.
Linked websites and third party services
Our websites and services may provide links to other third-party websites and services, which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services you use.
Children's privacy
Eyefi does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Eyefi encourages parents and guardians to take steps to protect their children's on-line privacy. The Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies provide resources to help protect children's on-line privacy, including http://www.onguardonline.gov/topics/protect-kids-online.
Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information
Eyefi processes Personal Information on servers in the United States and other countries. In some cases, Eyefi may process or store your Personal Information on a server outside your own country, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your Personal Information you understand and consent to such transfer, processing and storage of Personal Information.
