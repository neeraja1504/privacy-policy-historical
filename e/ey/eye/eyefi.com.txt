Last Revised Nov. 15, 2015
Eye-Fi, Inc. ("Eyefi") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our website and in using our products and services (collectively "Products"). This policy covers the Eyefi websites and applications and is applicable worldwide. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices for both online and offline data. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy. This policy may be updated from time to time and our website will indicate when the policy has been updated. You may access the current version at any time by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link at the footer on our website. References to Eyefi in this privacy policy include Eyefi subsidiaries and affiliates.
Collection of your personal information
Described below are situations in which personal information is collected and the purposes for which it is collected. "Personal Information" is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include, but is not limited to, name, email address, postal or other physical address, credit or debit card number, information generated from use of our Products, and other information required to provide a Product, deliver a product, or carry out a transaction you have requested. Personal Information may also include "Content," as defined below. Some of the reasons we collect your Personal Information may include:
account registration
use of certain Product features
generating reports based on information collected from use of our Products
requesting service and support for our Products and providing such support
placing transactions or orders
participating in an online survey
submitting an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotion
billing and collecting payments for our Products
participating in discussion groups or forums
registering for membership programs or newsletter subscriptions
customizing the advertising and content you see
When you access your Eyefi account and utilize Eyefi services, Eyefi automatically records certain information about your use, such as account activity, data displayed or clicked on, and other information including browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL. Some of this information collected, such as IP address and the contents of certain cookies, may include personal information.
Automated Collection of Information
Analytics information:
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for our Products. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Products, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Products. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
Log file information:
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
When you use our Products, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Products, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Products.
Device identifiers:
When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Products, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Products.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Products and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Products may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Metadata:
Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
Users can add or may have Metadata added to their Content (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you.
Cookies:
Like many websites, Eyefi uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.
A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.
In addition, Eyefi uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. Disabling cookies on your computer may cause Eyefi web pages to be inaccessible, inoperable or may disable some features. For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools.

Content
If you transfer photos, videos and related EXIF data (collectively, "Content") directly between Eyefi cards and cameras and other supported devices, which may include computers, smartphones, or tablets, Eyefi does not transfer such Content to, or store such Content on, Eyefi servers.

Eyefi handles your Content the same as other Personal Information described in this privacy policy.
