What lawful basis do we rely upon?
We must always have a “lawful basis” (i.e. a legal reason, prescribed by law) for processing your personal information. We rely on one of the following reasons when processing your personal information:
Our Legitimate interest
Sometimes it is in our legitimate interest to process your personal information. This may be when:
We process your browser information and log-in details in connection with the functionality of our website.
We use profiling in order to improve our services and personalise your experience when visiting our website (you have the right to object to this type of processing – please see below “ Your Rights ”).
We may share your personal information in the event of a proposed sale, restructuring, transfer or merging of any or all parts of our business, including to respond to queries from the prospective buyer or merging organisation.
Necessary to perform a contract with you
Processing of your personal information may be necessary to perform a contract with you, for example when we process your name, telephone number, email address and payment information in order to provide you with subscription content or provide our services to you.
Legal obligation
In certain circumstances, we may be under a legal obligation to process your personal information. Examples of this include:
Disclosing your contact details, including your name, telephone number and email address in order to comply with instructions, orders and requests from law enforcement agencies, any court or otherwise as required by law.
Maintaining your contact details in records that are required by law to evidence our compliance with laws, including consumer protection laws and data protection laws.
Personal Information We Share and Why
From time to time, we may ask third parties to carry out certain business functions for us, such as IT support. These third parties will process your personal information on our behalf.
We will disclose your personal information to these parties so that they can perform those functions. Before we disclose your personal information to these third parties, we will seek to ensure that they have appropriate security standards in place to protect your personal information.
Security of Your Personal Information
We will take specific steps (as required by applicable data protection laws) to ensure we take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unlawful or unauthorised processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.
How Long We Keep Personal Information
We will only retain your personal information for a limited period of time and for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we are processing it for. This will depend on a number of factors, including:
Any laws or regulations that we are required to follow
Whether we are in a legal or other type of dispute with each other or any third party
The type of information that we hold about you
Whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal information
Your Rights
Where our processing of your personal information is based on your consent , you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do decide to withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your personal information for that purpose, unless there is another lawful basis we can rely on – in which case, we will let you know.
Where our processing of your personal information is based on our legitimate interests , you can object to this processing at any time. If you do this, we will need to show either a compelling reason why our processing should continue, which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing is necessary for us to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
Where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to that processing.
You also have the right to (subject to applicable laws and certain limitations):

require us to erase your personal information;
require us to restrict processing of your personal information;

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant Supervisory Authority (in the UK this would be the Information Commissioner’s Office, for example. However, if you do have a reason to complain then please let us know so that we can investigate.
