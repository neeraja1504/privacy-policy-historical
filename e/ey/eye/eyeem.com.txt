3 The purposes for which we process your personal data
We collect and process your personal data for the purpose of providing you with our services and their advanced features, continuously improving and developing them, ensuring their technical functionality and ensuring the security of our services.
4 What personal information we collect from you and how we use it
What personal information we collect from you and how we use it
Data you submit to us ...
(a) ... if you register as a photographer/videographer (creator)
You are “creator” if you want to share your content with us within the community (community account) or if you also want to offer it for licensing (seller account).
Community account (creator)
To set up a community member account, we need:
● Your e-mail address
● Your username chosen by you or generated automatically by us (@username), which also corresponds to your user ID and which will be linked to your e-mail address
● A password to protect your user account
● If you register with us via a social network of Facebook, Inc. or Google, Inc., please read section 4.3 (a), since in this case we do not collect your data from you, but from a third party – namely the respective social network.
Seller account (creator)
For the activation of your seller account, we need the following in addition to the information that you have provided us for your community account:
● Your real name (i.e. your legal name)
● Your address
● Information about whether you are over 18 years old
● Name of the company/corporation and the tax number, if you sell your contents as a merchant or for a company
● Your PayPal account information. We will ask you to notify us of your PayPal account information at the latest after the sale of a license to use one of your contents. Optionally, you can also link your account to your EyeEm account if you click on the “Earnings” section in the menu.
Provision of the above information about you is required. Otherwise, we cannot create a user account for you and – in the case of a seller account – will not conduct transactions with you and therefore do not give licenses to your content.
We use the above data:
● To create your user account as a creator and, in the case of a seller account, also determine your identity, because we need to know who is the licensor in the case of a license sale.
● To contact you in case of required releases.
● To contact you in the event of alleged copyright infringement and to clarify any other issues with your content.
● To pay your license share to you.
● If necessary, to ask you if you would like to carry out orders for us.
● According to your account settings, you can receive notifications via the app (push notifications) and/or via e-mail on e.g. community updates, promotions, mentions, license sales etc. If you do not want to receive notifications, you can unsubscribe from them at any time in the settings of the app or via the existing link in the email.
● WITH YOUR CONSENT, we use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter.
Storage time:
In principle, we only store this data until the deletion of your user account. If you have sold a license to your content, your data will also be archived for the duration of the statutory retention periods (tax-related, e.g. 10 years).
Legal basis:
The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfillment of a contract between you and us (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) as far as it is necessary and you have given it to us (e.g. for the newsletter).
(b) ... if you register as a buyer to purchase user licenses
If you would like to purchase licenses for the use of content posted there via the EyeEm Market (buyer account), we need the following data from you to create your user account and to carry out transactions:
● Your real name (i.e. your legal name)
● Your address
● Your e-mail address
● The name of your company and the tax number or sales identification number if you act as a merchant or a company
● Your payment details such as credit card number, credit card holder, etc. This data is requested at the latest when you want to acquire a license to use content. However, we do not store this data ourselves; it is sent by us directly to the payment service provider appointed by us and deleted after the transaction has been completed.
Providing this information about you is required. Otherwise, we cannot create a user account for you and cannot conduct transactions with you and therefore not grant you any licenses.
We use this data
● To create a user account and identify you.
● To handle transactions.
● To send you notifications concerning transactions made (i.e. license purchases and the related payment processing).
WITH YOUR CONSENT, we use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter.
Storage time:
We usually store this data in our active storage only until your user account is deleted and pending transactions are completed. Following this, we will archive the data for the duration of the statutory retention periods (tax-related, e.g. 10 years).
Legal basis:
The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfillment of a contract between you and us (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit.a GDPR) insofar as it is required and you have given it to us (e.g. for the newsletter).
(c) ... if you provide additional, voluntary information in your profile
If you have a creator account, you can voluntarily provide additional profile information in your profile to make it more meaningful. For example you can:
● Change the username automatically generated by us.
● Specify a name for your profile (this does not necessarily have to be your real name, i.e. your legal first and last name).
● Upload a picture of you for the profile picture.
● Provide further information about you for the profile text.
We use this data exclusively to make it visible in your profile to other users.
Storage time:
As a rule, we only save this data until your user account has been deleted and pending transactions have been completed.
Legal basis:
The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfillment of a contract between you and us (Art. 6 (1) lit.b GDPR).
(d) ... if you upload content
If you have a creator account and upload content to EyeEm, we process the information contained in the metadata of the content (so-called exif data), such as date, time and location of the recording, camera type, shutter speed, etc. and any additional information you provide about the content. We only collect and process information about the location of the recording if this information is already contained in the metadata, if this information results from the content (e.g. landmarks, identifiers) or if you add the location yourself when uploading.
We use this data to provide our services, in particular to optimize the sales opportunities of the content because content with meaningful metadata can be found better.
Storage time:
We usually store this data only until your user account is deleted and pending transactions are completed.

If you register for our newsletter on our site, we will save:
● The e-mail address you provided.
We use your e-mail address only to send you our newsletter and to verify your e-mail address beforehand, so that you do not receive the newsletter unintentionally, e.g. because an unauthorized third party entered your e-mail address (so-called double opt-in).
Storage time:
Your e-mail address will be deleted as soon as you unsubscribe from the newsletter.
Legal basis:
The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfillment of a contract between you and us (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR), which you provide to us with your request to receive our newsletter.
(h) ... if you provide us a model or property release

● Your name
● Your address
● Your e-mail address
● Your date of birth for a model release, and
● Where applicable, the location of your property for a property release.
Providing this information about you is necessary in order to prove to third parties that you consent that we grant rights to use the contents that depict you. Otherwise, we will not be able to prove our eligibility and will not issue licenses.
We only disclose the information to our distribution partners within the framework of the model releases and, if necessary, to our licensees. For more information, please see point section 5.2.
Storage time:
We store the releases for the duration that we are allowed to market the respective content and, in case of a licensing, also store the respective content beyond this period in order to be able to prove our original authorization in hindsight. The same applies to the third party to whom we pass on this data.
Legal basis:
The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfillment of a contract (namely the respective release) between you and us (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR) or your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) that you expressly confirm with us in the context of the respective release.

(i) What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that leaves a web portal on your device (computer, tablet or smartphone) when you visit it. This allows the portal to “remember” certain inputs and settings (e.g., login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over a period of time, and you do not need to re-enter them each time you visit and navigate the portal.
(ii) How can you exercise control over cookies?
You can control and/or delete cookies at your convenience. You can find out how to do this in the help function of the browser you are using or, for example, here: aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies stored on your device and set most browsers to prevent the storage of cookies. But then you may be required to make some settings manually each time you visit a page and accept the impairment of some features.
(iii) EyeEm cookies
On our website we use cookies for storage:
of your session ID, so that our server can recognize you. This cookie is valid for one month and is automatically renewed afterwards. This is mandatory for the use of our service because features are otherwise impaired, and you e.g. cannot upload or download content for the purpose of licensing.
Your decision for (or against) the use of cookies. Cookies are valid for 6 months. They are not absolutely necessary for the use of our service.
The information collected through cookies will not be used to identify you and the information will be completely under our control. Cookies are not used for purposes other than those mentioned here.
(iv) Cookies and similar third-party technologies
In addition to our own cookies, we also use third-party cookies and similar technologies (such as counting pixels) to provide our services, including troubleshooting, quality assurance, system-security monitoring, statistics and analytics, and a user-friendly design of our offerings (e.g. site-specific photo contests, etc.), to measure efficiency and for optimization of advertisements we provide with other providers. As the providers and other technologies used may change, you should periodically review our privacy policy for updates.
