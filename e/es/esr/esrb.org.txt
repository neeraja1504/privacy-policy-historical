How is your information used?
We may use your information for various operational purposes. For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. In addition, as discussed further below, we may utilize your information to send you email updates; address your inquiries, comments or complaints; or fulfill requests to rate a game or app.
Email Updates
Our email updates are powered by third-party Mailchimp®.  To review Mailchimp®’s privacy practices, please see the “Privacy for Contacts” section of its privacy policy. If you choose to sign up, we will utilize your email address and, if provided, first name, to send you email updates.
You voluntarily provide us with this information, and we process it consistent with our legitimate interests. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to sign up for email updates.
We retain this information unless and until you unsubscribe from our email updates, or you otherwise contact us to request that we delete this information.
User Inquiries, Comments and Complaints
If you contact us using one of our online contact forms to submit a question, comment or complaint, we utilize the information you provide us to best address your complaint or inquiry. For example, if you submit a complaint about a video game retailer, we contact that retailer on your behalf to attempt to resolve your complaint. If you contact us with an inquiry or complaint regarding a rating assigned to a video game or app, we will either do our best to address your inquiry or complaint ourselves (if you are in North America), or we will advise you of the organization best suited to do so (if you are outside North America).
You voluntarily provide us with this information, and we process it consistent with our legitimate interests. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to submit a complaint, make an inquiry, or otherwise contact us through the Websites.
Except as set forth in the next sentence or in the unusual circumstance when additional time is needed to adequately address your inquiry or complaint, we will delete your email after 12 months. If your complaint is directed at ESRB Privacy Certified and concerns a member of the Privacy Certified program’s failure to abide by the Privacy Certified program requirements, your email and any other documents relating to your complaint will be retained for 3 years by statute.
Rating Customers
Sections of the Websites are dedicated to ESRB’s business function of rating computer and video games and online apps. If you are a video game or app publisher and you submit a video game or app to be rated by ESRB, we utilize the personal and business information you provide us to rate the video game or app you submit to us, to maintain a historical record of the rating, and to obtain payment for our rating services.
We consider this to be a legitimate commercial interest that justifies our collection of your information.  Moreover, our collection may be necessitated by our contractual obligations to provide and track ratings, all of which is in the public’s interest.  However, the decision whether to provide the information to us, belongs to you. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to submit a game or app for rating.
Except for the credit card information used for payment, we maintain the information obtained in connection with a rating, including the personal and business information you provide us, in a database. Because our rating of a game or app does not expire, we maintain this information indefinitely, meaning we will not delete it.
We do not store your credit card information, except the last 4 digits of the credit card number and the cardholder’s name. We maintain this information only as long as necessary to satisfy its operational purpose.
