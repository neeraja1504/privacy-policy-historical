ESR is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. You can access and browse our website without disclosing your personal information. Any information automatically retrieved during your visit, such as IP address, browser type and pages visited, is anonymous and is used for statistical analysis of the use of this site, and to prevent unauthorised access or attacks or to resolve such events. We may use this information even if you are not involved in such activity.

Once ESR receives any personal information from you, your data will be added to an ESR database. ESR will hold that information securely and will only use such information for the purpose that you gave it to us:
to provide you with publications that you have requested

to respond to a service or information request
How long will we keep your personal information for?
Periodically we will check that you still want us to retain your information and that it is up-to-date. You can at any time request that your information be removed from our database.
