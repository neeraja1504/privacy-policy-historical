ESL Video, Inc.,
Privacy Policy for ESLvideo.com.
ESL VIDEO, INC. IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF ITS SUBSCRIBERS AND USERS OF ITS ONLINE SERVICES. WE FOLLOW THESE POLICIES:
E-mail Addresses.
We ask users who register for our online services to provide us with their e-mail addresses. These addresses are used only to send news and, when necessary, account information to those subscribers. ESL Video, Inc. never sells, rents, or lends e-mail addresses of users to anyone.
E-mailed news may contain advertising, and such advertising may be "targeted" based on demographic information, e-mail domains, or zip codes. Such targeting is done through processes internal to ESL Video, Inc., and information from subscribers is not made available to advertisers or anyone else outside ESL Video, Inc..
Users can stop receiving news from ESLvideo.com at any time. Instructions for stopping news from ESLvideo.com appear at the end of each e-mail message.
E-mail addresses that we obtain as part of our "E-mail this page to a friend" service are used only to provide that service. We do not share them with anyone or use them for any other purpose.
Usernames and Passwords.
Each person who registers to use this service has a username and password. Users may log in with the password generated by ESL Video, Inc., then choose their own password at any time by visiting their "My Account: Settings" page.
Passwords are the private property of the subscriber. For reasons of security and privacy, we do not give out passwords to anyone. If you forget your username or password, you can send yourself an e-mail reminder by visiting the "Forgot Your Password" page.
