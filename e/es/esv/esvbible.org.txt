Privacy Policy (Good News Publishers / Crossway Books)
The following policy applies to usage of our website and orders placed thereon. For information about our "offline" privacy policy, please call our customer service department at 1-800-543-1659.
Good News / Crossway respects your privacy. We will not share your name with other organizations unless you indicate that we may do so.
What information do you collect from me?
We collect aggregate data--how many times a certain page is visited, for example, but we do not tie this data to your specific visit. We record search terms used so we can refine our search engine. We only collect personally identifiable information--your name, for example--when you create an online account with us, place an order, or contact us and provide this information.
We also use a technology called "cookies" for your convenience. This technology allows you to order more than once from us without having to re-enter all your information. You can turn off cookies by changing your browser's preferences.
With whom do you share my information?
If you create an account with us, you may choose whether to allow us to share your information with other Christian ministries who have a similar vision. If you do not specifically give us permission to do this, we will not share your information with any third parties.
What will you do with my information?
If you place an order, you will receive any necessary communication from us relating to it. We may also send you newsletters and updates via postal mail and email. If you do not want to receive these mailings, email service@gnpcb.org.
