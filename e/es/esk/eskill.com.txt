• Marketing channels: website and blog

• eSkill Application: Test-taker perspective
Upon request, eSkill will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your PII. To request this information,please contact us at dataprotection@eskill.com, Subject: PII Information. eSkill will reply to your request in an email within an estimated period of 30 (thirty) days.
You may at any time order a complete data copy. Your data will be delivered within 30 working days as spreadsheet files in Microsoft Excel format.

We will charge a $500 fee for additional copies. eSkill is the hosting site for testing done by other companies (the “Customer”). Therefore, we do not issue the test or test results to Test Takers, nor are we involved in the hiring process. When the eSkill Application provides test scores and any interpretation of them to a Customer, we cannot delete that information from the Customer’s records, nor can we control the use the Customer makes of it. The Customer, as the entity that issues the tests and manages your test results, has control of this information. Please refer to your point of contact from the company that issued the test you took if you have any privacy concerns with your testing information.
• eSkill Application: Customer perspective
If you are a Customer, you may submit a request to access, review, correct, or delete your PII by contacting dataprotection@eskill.com with the Subject: PII Changes.
If you are a Customer, we cannot delete all of your PII unless we also delete your user account.

Final considerations:
For all three of the above-mentioned categories, you can always choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, telephone calls, or postal mail from eSkill. Every marketing email from eSkill contains instructions for how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails.
We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
Since we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Websites or through the Services. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your PII because some residual information may exist in archived data backups. Finally, we reserve the right to retain and use your PII as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
