Escorts.com Privacy Policy
At Escorts.com we're committed to our customers' privacy and have made this a high priority. Because of this, we've taken every precaution to eliminate the loss and dissemination of any and all sensitive and personal information. Using the best and most-up-to-date security software on the market, we ensure that customers' transactions and data stay with us.
We will neither sell, exchange or otherwise benefit from the information a customer provides on the website.
Customers needn't worry about security issues, as our network and proprietary software architecture are PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant. Using the PCI Data Security Standard as its framework, CISP (Cardholder Information Security Program) provides the tools and measurements needed to protect against cardholder data exposure and compromise across the entire payment industry.
ScanAlert, a program that acts like a hacker, probing for all known ways to break into servers, polices our LAN (Local Area Network) for being hacker-proof. In this way, hackers are stopped even before they get started. Verisign provides us with 128-bit encryption protocol with secure keys, which further ensures our customers against hackers and tampering. Our site's certification can be verified by clicking on the HackerSafe banner, which is placed at the bottom of every page.
