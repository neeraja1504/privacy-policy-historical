Privacy Policy
Overview

By using the Region 4 website, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in the current policy. Under some circumstances, Region 4 may be compelled to disclose such information in accordance with the Texas Public Information Act or other legal or administrative requirements.

Personal Information
Region 4 does not collect any specific personal information about website visitors—such as name, postal address, or e-mail address—except when such information is knowingly, and voluntarily, provided to Region 4. Personal information is obtained from online transactions such as professional development registrations, online purchases, e-mail newsletters, online surveys, membership purchases, or employment or admissions applications. If Region 4 is provided with such information, you are giving Region 4  permission to use that information to respond to or process your request. For monetary transactions the financial aspect of the transaction is temporarily stored until the transaction has been completed then purged according to standard PCI practices.
Region 4 automatically collects and stores "non-personally identifiable" information for statistical purposes. This information helps Region 4 monitor how visitors use the site. This information may include: your browser software (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Netscape Navigator), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), name and domain of your Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL, NET.com), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using.
Security
The Region 4 website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to process registrations and all online purchases.

Credit card information is not permanently stored on the web server. Your order information, excluding private payment information, is retained for our records, but is never shared with other organizations or people.
