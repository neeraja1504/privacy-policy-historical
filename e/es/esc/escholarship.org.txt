eScholarship: Privacy Policy
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
We gather and store certain information about eScholarship users in order to better understand and meet your needs, diagnose problems with our server and administer our site. This stored information does not identify you personally and only includes:
IP address
Domain (e.g., aol.com, berkeley.edu)
Browser and operating system
Date and time of access
Referring site
The session logs that contain these data are retained unaltered for 30 days. After this time, the logs are "cleansed." (IP addresses are completely removed.) The anonymized data are kept for one to two years, depending on storage constraints, after which time they are deleted from our system.
Cookies
A "cookie" enables customization of Web service by storing information on your workstation through a Web server. eScholarship uses a session cookie to store a session ID, which facilitates features such as My Items. No information other than the session ID is recorded, and the cookie expires when you close the browser window. For users who have disabled cookies, the session ID is stored in the URL.
Links to Other Sites
Some pages on eScholarship may link to external sites and services that are not under our control. You must read the privacy statements at these external sites to learn of their privacy policies.
Site Security
To guard against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and promote the correct use of information, we have implemented a number of procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
However, we cannot guarantee that these measures will always and in all cases prevent or protect against invalid access or improper activity. For this reason, we avoid keeping information beyond the term of its primary use and, where possible, encrypt or delete data elements that might enable activities to be linked to individual users.
