1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
We collect the following types of information:
Information about Site Users : We ask for certain information when Site user submits a request for further information about the Services, which may include a name, school name, school district name, email address, phone number, and/or message content. We use this information to communicate with our website visitors and, if a Site user subscribes to the Services, we may also use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Services and to monitor our service offerings and functionality.
We may also use this information we collect from Site users to periodically send information that we think our website visitors might find of interest from IO Education or its affiliates such as new services or special offers. You always have the option to opt out of our internal marketing communications by contacting us at unsubscribe@ioeducation.com or by following the opt-out procedure outlined in such communications.  Please note that opting out of receiving these communications will not remove your personal information from our files and we will still contact you as necessary to provide the Services (or information about our Services) at your request.
Information Collected through Technology : We automatically collect certain types of usage information when visitors view the Site. We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets IO Education enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Site (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Site), and allow us to track your usage of the Site over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Site. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Site, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our website visitors. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to Site visitors who have provided their contact information to us as described above to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Site. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Site. We do not allow third party advertising networks to collect information about the users of our Site.
We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log files, device identifiers, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Site; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Site; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help users efficiently access information.
2. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
IO Education only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below. We do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes.
We may share information with certain third-party providers whose software or services interface with or otherwise may receive information from, or provide information to, the Site.
We may share information with those that provide us with technology services (e.g. web hosting and analytics services), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us.
We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our Terms of Use or other service agreements, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.
If we sell, divest or transfer the business or a portion of our business, we may transfer information, provided that the new provider has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own. We may also transfer personal information – under the same conditions – in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.
By submitting or posting information, materials or content via the Site, you agree that we can further distribute such content as described in the Terms under “Submissions.”  You agree that you have no expectation of or right to privacy with respect to such Submissions, except for any limits on our ability to use or distribute such content as set forth in the Terms.
3. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We store our data in the United States and take strong measures to keep data safe and secure.
Storage and Processing: Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.
Keeping Your Information Safe: IO Education maintains administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. While no service provider can guarantee absolute security when communicating over the internet or wireless networks, we are committed to taking steps to help secure any personal information that may be in our possession.  Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.
You should always be mindful and responsible whenever disclosing information online that the information is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, could be collected and used by others without your consent.
