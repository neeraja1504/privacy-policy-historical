On some areas of our site, we may use cookies, web beacons, server logs, and other technologies to collect aggregated, non-personal information. Cookies are small files which save information to enable your preferences when browsing a Web site to be remembered. They do not cause any damage to your computer or computer files and you are not obliged to accept the cookies which are used within the site.

Escape the City cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Escape the City’'s coolest features. Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

Escape the City Personnel: Escape the City personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of Escape the City business.

We treat personal information collected through this website as confidential and will never share it unless you have expressly given us permission to do so. This website has appropriate technical and organisational security measures in place to prevent other disclosures of its members' personal information, other unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage. Users should be aware, however, that the Internet is by its nature not a secure medium and we cannot therefore give an absolute guarantee of security.
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
Keeping Information Secure
Your Escape the City account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.

Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information

As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
