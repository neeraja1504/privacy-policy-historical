Privacy Policy
(effective January 2019)
Essex Property Trust, Inc. (“Essex,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities in California and Washington.  This Privacy Policy describes our data practices regarding information that could be used to identify you or that is associated with information that identifies you (“Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that we gather or collect via the Web Site, as well as to Personal Information collected offline by Essex.  It does not apply to any Personal Information collected by third party web sites not operated by Essex.  Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Essex will not share, sell, or rent individual Personal Information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES ESSEX GATHER ABOUT ME?
Personal Information You Provide
General
We collect certain Personal Information you voluntarily provide in order to deliver services.  For example, you may be asked to provide Personal Information such as name, email address, and phone number, when requesting a tour of an Essex apartment community.  If you do not provide this Personal Information, we may not be able to assist you in scheduling a tour of an Essex apartment community.  We may collect your email address so that we can send you information you have requested. We may use your email address to inform you about current events or to send you updates regarding information that was previously sent to you.
Essex works with third party web site operators to provide services such as online rental applications, resident services, and investor relations information (“Portal Sites”).  When you input Personal Information to one of Essex’s Portal Sites, you are providing that information to a third party.  Essex’s Portal Sites may utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Web Site when the user is actually on a Portal Site.  For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of www.essexapartmenthomes.com, but the URL listed in your browser is a different URL than www.essexapartmenthomes.com, then know that any information you provide is being collected by this third party and not governed by this Privacy Policy.
When you leave the Web Site and are transferred to a Portal Site, you may be notified that you are no longer on the Essex Web Site.  You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of use for any Portal Site before using and providing Personal Information through a Portal Site.  The operators of such Portal Sites may share the information you enter with Essex.  You should carefully review this Privacy Policy to see how Essex uses information you enter through the Web Site or through any Portal Sites.
On-Site
In order to submit a rental application online for one of Essex’s apartment communities, you will be redirected to a Portal Site operated by On-Site.  On-Site will request certain Personal Information from you in order to process your rental application.  This information may include your name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, social security number, and other identifying information.  On-Site collects this information to process your rental application and communicate your regarding your rental application. You should review On-Site’s data collection and sharing practices prior to providing any Personal Information to On-Site.
Rentcafé
Resident Portal is run and operated by Rentcafé.  Rentcafé provides certain resident services such as payment processing, maintenance support and requests, and other technical support.  Rentcafé operates bulletin boards and chat rooms, and offers promotions, contests, or sweepstakes.  Rentcafé collects certain Personal Information in order to provide you with these services and may require the creation of an account to access these services.  You should review Rentcafé’s privacy policy prior to providing any information to Rentcafé.
iCIMS
Essex uses a third party to process applications for employment, iCIMS.  iCIMS collects Personal Information when you fill out an application for employment at Essex.  This information may include your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, employment history, educational history, and other Personal Information that is or may be relevant the position to which you are applying.  iCIMS collects this information to and shares this information with Essex so that Essex can evaluate your application for employment and communicate with you about the position or positions you are seeking.

COOKIES
A cookie is a small text file that is saved in a user’s browser when you access our Web Site. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Web Site.
We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Web Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.
We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Web Site and other Web sites.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our Web Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Web Site, such as saving properties, will be limited.
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our Web Site. For example, on occasion an advertiser may run a banner campaign on our Web Site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this Web Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our Web Site or other Essex web sites.  See the “Third Party Advertisers” and “Links to Other Sites” sections of this Privacy Policy below for more information.

CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS)
We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our Web Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information. We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS
The ads appearing on this Web Site or other Essex web sites, if any, may be delivered to users by third-party advertising companies. Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear gifs on this Web Site, which allow it to recognize a user’s cookie when a user visits this Web Site and other Web sites. The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from Essex. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Web Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit that collects personally identifiable information.
HOW WE RESPOND TO “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Our systems do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our business partners who utilize cookies, Web Beacons, or other tracking technologies on the Web Site may enable you to opt out of certain of their cookies, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies and the tailoring of advertisements to your interests. We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of certain communications from us.  You can learn about this in the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.
