Data collection
It is standard practice for web servers to collect data automatically about all requests for files (web pages, images, etc).  As we are processing Data gathered by University of Essex web servers include:
What data is collected?
Your IP address
Details about your web browser
Details about the files requested
Date and time of requests for each file requested,
The referring page, if any, from which you may have followed a hyperlink
Search terms and search results
The domain from which your request originated
Your username, if you have authenticated with the webserver
In addition to data collected automatically by the webservers, some of our pages request additional information; for instance, the prospectus request form asks for contact and other details, and the MyEssex portals allow you to record a range of preferences so that you can customise whatyou see. Where this happens you will find further specific information about the data gathered and its use.
Additional data for specialist applications
Specialist applications, including the MyEssex portals and e-learning tools, such as Moodle, Perception and OCS gather user data specific to their intended purpose. Data gathered by these applications includes user identifiers, tracking information, user contributions (e.g. on discussion forums, submitted essay content and assessment answers).
