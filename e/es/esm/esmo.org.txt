ESMO respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information.

As a website gathers individual pieces of Information from its users, it may combine similar data from many or all the users of the website into one big “batch.” This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Websites may use aggregate data or share it with business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Web know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience.

The information about your use of the app (including your IP address) which is generated by the ID will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymisation, Google will truncate/anonymise the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.
Google will use this information on our behalf for evaluating your use of the app, compiling reports on your activity in the app and other services relating to app activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
You may refuse the logging of the information about your use of the app (including your IP Address) generated by the ID of Google Analytics App Tracking by selecting “disable Google Analytics” in the settings of the app. Henceforth, any further tracking will be stopped as you will have “opted-out“ by selecting the disable setting. However, please note that this applies only to this version of the app. In other apps tracking still might be activated.
In this app the IP anonymisation is activated.

Android user: This data is stored on the SD card of your device and can be restored in case of app updates or reinstalling the app. If you change the location / file storage of backups manually, the app is unable to access your notes and bookmarks.
