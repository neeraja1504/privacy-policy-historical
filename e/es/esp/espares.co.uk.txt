Changes to our Privacy Policy
eSpares Ltd may make changes every now and then to its privacy policy & terms & conditions, it is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with the latest versions prior to using our website and our services.
We are a secure site
eSpares Ltd uses various organisational and technical measures to protect your personal information and is proud to be certified against BSI EN ISO9001 for business processes.
Organisational Measures – eSpares Ltd have company policies and handling procedures in place which employees and business partners with whom we may share your information must follow. Regular training is also undertaken to ensure policy and procedures and all applicable regulations and laws are followed.
Access Control & Authentication – eSpares Ltd use access control systems to ensure only authorised employees and business partners have access to your information that is limited to what is needed for carrying out their job. Each individual with access has to provide access credentials in order to gain access to the systems which are monitored.
Just as eSpares Ltd employees and business partners can gain access to your personal information, eSpares Ltd site may also provide you with account facilities where you can customise and improve your user experience and manage any customisable settings as well as view your own account information.
In order to provide this service eSpares Ltd invite you in the first instance to create a username and password. eSpares Ltd would ask that you maintain the confidentiality of these credentials just as we do ours to help prevent unauthorised access.
eSpares Ltd offer the following tips to keep your log in details secure:
Make your password strong – the longer and more complicated it is the harder it is for others to guess or crack, we suggest using a passphrase (a random selection of words you can easily remember) or why not use a password manager (there are many freely available on line that can create one for you and remember it so that you don’t have to
Don't share passwords with anyone - even someone you know, passwords can be easily compromised especially if they are known to others
Don't reuse passwords across multiple on line accounts - once a password is compromised a crook can try these credentials on other websites that you may use and gain unauthorised access allowing them learn more about you which can then be used for fraud or identity theft
Encryption - eSpares Ltd use data encryption to ensure safe and secure transactions. eSpares Ltd site is secured using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology which creates an encrypted link between the web server and your browser ensuring that all data passed between us remains private and secure.
In order to be able to generate this encrypted link a web server requires an SSL/TLS Certificate. SSL/TLS certificates confirm two essential factors:
That you have a secure SSL/TLS (encrypted) link with our website.
That the website owner is a valid and legitimate organisation.
Payment Card Data – In addition to eSpares Ltd using your payment details to process your order, the organisation that processes the payment together with your card issuer may do additional fraud checks to verify the card and the transaction is legitimate.
Visa & MasterCard in particular may interrupt the order process after you enter your payment details and will prompt you for an additional security password where you are using one of these cards and are enrolled in either the "MasterCard SecureCode" or "Verified by Visa" schemes. Where you are not enrolled you will be asked to enrol. Once this process is completed you will be returned to our website to complete the transaction.
MasterCard® SecureCode™ Explained
MasterCard® SecureCode™ is a simple and secure method of payment at online stores, for which you will have a private code known only to you and to your bank. Your SecureCode™ enhances your existing MasterCard® account by safeguarding against unauthorised use of your card when shopping at participating online retailers. Every time you make a payment with these retailers, you will be automatically prompted to enter your own private SecureCode™ - just like entering a PIN at a cash machine. In seconds, you gain added protection while shopping online.
Verified by Visa Explained
Verified by Visa is a simple password-protected identity-checking service that takes the risk out of online shopping for both retailers and customers. Retailers are protected against fraudulent transactions and the costs associated with it, while customers can spend with confidence knowing that their payment details are safe.
Data Storage & Retention – In order to minimise the risk of exposure to your information Espares Ltd only keep your information for as long as needed in accordance with our policies, industry best practice and to comply with the law. Espares Ltd current internal retention policy is set to a maximum of 7 years this allows us to comply with financial regulations and provides ample time for customers to make enquiries about previous orders and to deal with queries regarding any guarantee and warranty period on products or services sold to you.
