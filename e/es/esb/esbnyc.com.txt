We use these cookies to support the functionality of our website, including adjustments to content. Below is more detail about the types of cookies that we use:
•          Required: These cookies are required for the functioning of the website and may be used to implement security features or embed video or sound files.

These cookies allow our service providers and us to recognize and count the number of users of the website, see how they interact with the website and different functions, and determine how to improve the website.
•          Advertising: These cookies collect information in order to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers on websites that you visit, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to disable cookies on your browser (see below), but doing so may prevent you from using the full features of the Services.

With service providers, sellers, and partners:
We share information about you with service providers to perform functions and process your data and to help provide our Services, including hosting and storage providers or email service providers. In addition to using your information to help us provide our Services, service providers may use your personal information internally to improve their own services and may share it in connection with a sale, divestiture, or transfer of business assets; to protect their rights; or to comply with the law. In addition, our providers may share your personal information with their own third-party service providers. They may also combine the information about you that we share with them with contact and social media information related to you that they collect from publicly available sources or from third parties.
With analytics service providers and advertisers:
We let third parties use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on our Services. They may collect information about how you use our Services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.
Some companies may use information collected on our Services to deliver advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, targeted to your interests and preferences, on other websites or apps you may visit or on your social media feed and to gauge their effectiveness. To learn about your choices regarding this sharing of your information please see “Your Choices with Respect to your Information” section below.
With third parties for legal reasons:
We would share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
•          comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;
•          investigate, remedy, or enforce potential violations of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy;
•          protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or
•          detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
With third parties as part of an acquisition or liquidation:
If we are involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, corporate divestiture, reorganization, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, or if we undergo liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings, we may share your information with that company before and/or after the transaction closes or the proceedings are completed.
Aggregated information:
We also share with third parties—such as advertisers—aggregated or de-identified information and we do not limit our third-party providers from using, selling, licensing, distributing, or disclosing de-identified data.
6.          Our Legal Bases for Processing and Sharing Your Information
We process your information and share it with third parties for the purposes described in this Policy, based on the following legal grounds:
(1)       With your consent;
(2)       For our legitimate interests;

(4)       To comply with legal obligations.
With your consent:
We ask for your consent to process or share your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, we ask for your consent to provide you with promotional information. We also ask for your consent to collect information through surveys.
For our legitimate interests:
We process and share your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. For example, we process and share your information in order to help us:
•          Maintain and improve our Services;
•          Perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;

To fulfill our contractual obligations:
We process and share your information to provide a service you have requested under a contract. For example, we process your payment information when you purchase a ticket to visit the Empire State Building.
To comply with legal obligations:
We process and share your information when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.
7.          Cross Border Transfer
We transfer, process, and store information about you on servers located in the United States. Therefore, your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States, whose data protection, privacy, and other laws may not provide the same level of protection as those in your country of residence. For example, government entities in the United States and other countries may have certain rights to access your personal information. If we transfer your information outside of your country of residence in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.
By using the Services, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
8.          How do we store and protect your information?
We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. Please keep in mind that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium for communication, and we cannot guarantee that the information collected about you will always remain private when using our Services. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
9.          How long we retain your information
We will retain your information after you stop using Services to the extent that we are obliged to do so in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or as necessary to protect our legal rights or for certain business requirements.
Please note that even if you request that we delete your information, deletion by our third party providers may not be immediate and the deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time. Also, information that has already been shared with third parties may not be deleted by them.
10.        Your choices with respect to your information
Updating your information: If you need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, you can send a request to optout@esbnyc.com. To protect your privacy, before we give you access or let you update your information, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information. We will try to update and allow you to access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will disclose the fee before we comply with your request. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful.
Emails: You can stop receiving promotional email communications – such as our newsletter –  from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. We will retain your email address in order to be able to abide by your opt out choice. We make efforts to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may not opt out of service-related communications. If you have any questions, you can contact us directly at optout@esbnyc.com. Unsubscribing or opting out of communications with us will not stop communications you receive from third parties separately. Please review their terms and conditions for relevant options for opting out of their communications.
Analytics:  You can control the information provided to Google and opt out of certain ads provided by Google by using any of the methods set forth at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ or using the Google Analytics opt out browser add-on at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Cookies and other technologies: Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
Turning off your browser’s cookies will also prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded.
If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, which may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive. To find out how to see what cookies have been set and how to reject and delete the cookies, please visit: http://www.aboutcookies.org.
Advertising: You can understand which third parties have currently enabled cookies for your browser or mobile device and how to opt-out of some of those cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/; or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/ or, if you’re located in the European Union, at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu . For more information on mobile-specific opt-out choices, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.
On your mobile device you may have features that allow you to opt out of some targeted advertising (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android). To learn more about how these opt-out features work, please review your device settings.
Even if you disable the tracking, keep in mind that you may still receive interest-based advertising, including from third parties with whom your information had been previously disclosed and that you may still receive advertising from third parties, though such advertising may not be based on your interests and preferences.
