The Digital Services are owned and operated by ICE. Unless this Privacy Policy states otherwise, in this Privacy Policy, the terms "us", "we" or "our" refer collectively to ICE, NYSE and the ICE Affiliates.
This Privacy Policy applies only to the information collected on the Digital Services. It does not apply to access to ICE's electronic trading platforms, whether provided through the Internet or by other means. Access to ICE's electronic trading platforms is limited to members and participants of the relevant market who have entered into off-line agreements with ICE or an affiliate of ICE for such access, and is governed by the terms of those off-line agreements. Such agreements also explain how the personal information collected by ICE's electronic trading platforms is processed.
Your use of the Digital Services is subject to ICE's Terms of Use/Site Disclaimer, available here Terms of use and from our homepage, including any applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes.
This Privacy Policy is current as of the effective date set forth above. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes and modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting of the changes and modifications on the Digital Services, except where prohibited by law. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the current Privacy Policy. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changes by updating the effective date at the top of this policy and, if required by applicable laws, provide by other means, such as email or notice within the Digital Services. Where the changes will have a fundamental impact on the nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will, as required by applicable laws, provide you with notice in advance. If at any time you choose not to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Digital Services.
Personal information We Collect Directly from You
We collect personal information from you when you use the Digital Services. The type of information that we collect from you depends on your particular interaction with the Digital Services. We require you to register with the Digital Services to access certain features. When we do, we may collect the following information from you during the registration process: your name, country of residence, address, phone number, job title, company, investor type, email address, your marketing and communications preferences and a password that you select.
If you choose to purchase a product or service through the Digital Services, we may collect your credit card information. Currently, we use a third party service provider to process credit card transactions on our behalf. The third party will collect from you your contact information (such as your name, address, and e-mail) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date).
Personal information We Collect Automatically
We and our third party service providers, use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you automatically as you use our Digital Services. Examples of this type of information include, but are not limited to, the dates and times of your use of the Digital Services and the route by which you choose to access them, including your IP (Internet Protocol) address, your browser type, your operating system, or domain name, and your use of any hyperlinks or downloadable content available on the Digital Services. We may combine this information with other information that we collect about you. For additional information about our use of these technologies, please see “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” below and our Cookie Policy.
Personal Information We Collect From Third Parties
We also collect information about you from third party sources such as: suppliers that help us prevent money laundering and fraud; marketing agencies; identity verification services; and analytics providers.
The categories of information that we collect about you from other sources are:
where permissible under applicable law, personal details (e.g. name, date of birth);
contact details (e.g. phone number, email address, postal address or mobile number); and
employer name.
Please note that we may be required by law to collect and use certain personal information about you. And we may need to collect and use personal information to enter into or fulfil a contract with you. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfilment of our obligations in these circumstances.
We primarily use your personal information to provide our services to you and to respond to your inquiries. We also may use your personal information as follows:
To communicate with you, including to respond to your comments or requests for information, to request feedback on our products and services, and to notify you about changes to your subscriptions or to the services and products you use.
To help us understand our customers, to tailor and enhance our product and service offerings, anticipate and resolve problems with any products or services supplied to you, create products or services that may meet your needs.

To protect our rights, your rights, and the rights of others, and to meet our own high standards of business practice.
Some of the processing we conduct will involve making decisions about you based on automated processing of your personal information. For example, we may conduct profiling activities to select personalized offers or recommendations for you based on your use of the Digital Services, browsing history. If you are in the EU, where these decisions are based solely on our automated processing of your personal data (e.g., not subject to human review), these types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects on you, but you can still contact us for further information and to object to this use of your personal information.
Under EU privacy law, we must have a legal basis to process personal information. In most cases the legal bases for our processing, under EU law, will be one of the following:
to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, for example to provide the Digital Services or to ensure that invoices are paid correctly;
to comply with our legal and/or regulatory obligations, for example obtaining proof of your identity to enable us to meet our anti-money laundering obligations; and/or
to meet our legitimate interests, for example to: understand how you use the Digital Services and to enable us to use this knowledge to improve our products and services and to develop new ones; to communicate with you about the products and services that you use or we offer; maintain our accounts and records; to assess patterns of use; and to plan and evaluate our marketing and business development programs. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place, when needed, safeguards designed to protect your privacy interests, freedoms, and rights under applicable laws.
We may obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of personal information when we are required to do so by law (for example, in relation to some direct marketing activities, our use of cookies and tracking technologies or when we process sensitive personal information). If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.
We may anonymize your personal information and use it for other purposes. For example, we may prepare aggregated reports about how users interact with the Digital Services for research.
