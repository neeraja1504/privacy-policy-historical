When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
eSeth.net creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners.

Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.
