Information Security
The nature of our business requires us to collect and maintain certain personal information, and we understand that we have a responsibility to protect it. To do so, we maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to safeguard your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Your My Estes account is protected by your log-in credentials, which you must keep secure and confidential.
We also offer you the option of interacting with the My Estes portion of our website and sharing and viewing information on a secure or unsecure platform. When you opt to sign in to My Estes using the secure platform, the information you view and share is encrypted using SSL encryption. Encryption is the process of disguising information as data unintelligible to an unauthorized person.

When used between you and Estes Express Lines, this technology encrypts your personal information as you send it to us so that only Estes Express Lines can decrypt it. When we send personal or account information to you, this technology encrypts it and only you have the capability to decrypt. We use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications protocol when you log in to the My Estes portion of our website by opting to sign in “secure” mode. Please be advised that if you do not elect to sign in using the “secure” mode, your communications with and use of the My Estes portion of our website will not be secured with SSL encryption.
Many of the services we provide on this website use access codes or passwords, which provide an additional layer of security for your information. We communicate our privacy and security guidelines and standards to Estes employees who access personal information for purposes described in this policy, and we enforce these requirements within the company.
