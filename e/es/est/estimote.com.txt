1. How We Collect and Use Information
We collect personal information from our website visitors in order to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include:
Information that you provide to us. We collect information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Service, or communicate with us. For example, we may request your personal information (e.g., name, postal address, email address and password, telephone number, and billing information) and your applicable business information when you register for an account or purchase our Service. We may also collect any communications that you exchange with us. We will combine this information with information about how you use the Service.
Information we receive from third-parties. When you connect our Service with services offered by third-parties, such as by “Liking” us on Facebook or following us on Twitter, or when you link our Service with other services, which may include your profile information, user name, user ID associated with your account, language, country, and any other information you permit such third-party to share with us and/or that you permit us to receive from such third-party. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the third-party. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.

Information collected through technology. We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information.
2. How We Share Personal Information
We may share your personal information in the instances described below. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information.”
We may share your personal information with third-party service providers or business partners who help us deliver or improve our service, for example, providers who help us process payments, identify and send targeted advertising, send email or postal mail, provide back-office services, or measure site traffic. These providers will be given access to your personal information as is reasonably necessary to perform their function under reasonable confidentiality terms.
We may aggregate, or strip information of personally identifying characteristics, and then share that aggregated or anonymized information with third-parties.
We may share or disclose your personal information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that we are required to do so under applicable law or regulatory requirements, or if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with preventing fraud or illegal activity, and/or to enforce our Terms of Use.
We may share your personal information with corporate subsidiaries we own or control.
We reserve the right to transfer any information we collect in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including any shares in the company) or any portion or combination of our products, services, businesses and/or assets. Should such a transaction occur (whether a divestiture, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, liquidation, or similar transaction or proceeding), we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that any transferred information is treated in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
3. Customer Data
Our Service provides a technology that is installed in third-party mobile applications (“apps”) belonging to our Customers, and which provides our Customers with real-time analytics and tools to create a better experience for their end users. When a Customer uses our Service, the Customer’s app may collect personal information from end users (“Customer Data”) that is shared with Estimote. This Customer Data is owned and controlled by our customers, and any Customer Data that we maintain or process we consider to be strictly confidential. We collect and process Customer Data solely on behalf of our customers, and in accordance with our agreements with the customers. We do not use or disclose Customer Data except as authorized and required by our customers and provided for in our agreements with our customers.
In this Section, we describe the type of data that is collected through our Customers’ apps and shared with Estimote. Apps that use Estimote may use only some of the features and information that Estimote can collect. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the data collection and use practices ofEstimote’s website, and does not apply to Customer Data or to the data collection practices of our third party Customers that use our Service. It is always a good idea to carefully read the privacy policy of each mobile app you install and use on your mobile device to be sure you understand the app’s data collection and use practices.
Data Collected through the Service. Through the course of providing our Service to our Customers, our Customers’ apps will collect information from an end user’s device any time the end user’s app comes within range of an Estimote beacon (a small device that uses Bluetooth technology to identify Estimote- enabled Customer apps and may be placed in retail stores or other Customer locations). Estimote relies on an app-specific identifier that is used to identify a unique app user. This identifier is associated only with the specific Customer app and is not tied to your mobile device. If you delete the Customer app from your device, this identifier will be deleted as well. Relying on this app-specific ID, we collect your location (latitude/longitude coordinates) and the time of day and your location when your device is near any of our beacons. We also collect device information, such as the device type, model and operating system version, and current IP address. We use this information to identify when you enter or leave the range of a particular beacon in a Customer’s retail store or location where they have placed a Beacon in order to provide analytic tools to help our Customers better serve and understand their end users. We never collect personally identifying information such as a name, mobile phone number, email address, or other contact information from our Customer’s end users. If you do not want the Estimote beacon to identify your mobile device, you can: (a) delete the Customer app or adjust the in-app settings of the Customer app if the app makes that option available, or (b) turn “off” your Bluetooth through your device’s Settings feature.
4. Your Choices Regarding Your Information
Email Communications. From time to time, we may send you emails regarding updates to our website, products or services, notices about our organization, or information about products/services we offer (or promotional offers from third-parties) that we think may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe from such emails, simply click the “unsubscribe link” provided at the bottom of the email communication. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain Service-related email communications (e.g., account verification, billing confirmation, technical or legal notices).

We may permit third-party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or apps. Typically, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.

5. Data Protection and Security
Storage and transfer: Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Estimote or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which we or our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
Keeping information safe: Estimote cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and to notify our Customers if the security, integrity or confidentiality of personal information has been compromised, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
Estimote’s obligations with respect Customer Data are defined in our agreements with our customers, including our Terms of Service, and are not included in this Privacy Policy. Each customer will remain responsible for the privacy and security of the Customer Data that it collects and processes and for compliance with applicable data protection laws that may apply to the collection, processing and disclosure of Customer Data.
