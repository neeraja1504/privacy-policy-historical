Privacy Policy
Introduction.
Effective Date. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is June 4th, 2018.
Purpose. Vintage Software, LLC ("Vintage Software" or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the EstateSales.NET website, the EstateSales.NET service, and any software applications made available by Vintage Software, such as any mobile device application Vintage Software makes available (together, the "Service"). Vintage Software has published this "Privacy Policy" to show its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.
Scope. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service, and not to any websites or services of third parties ("Third Party Websites"), which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see Section 11 (Third Party Websites) and Section 4.2.3 (Third Party Cookies and Advertising).
Separate Terms of Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy Policy and Vintage Software's separate Terms of Service document (the "Terms of Service"), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service document is available at https://www.estatesales.net/terms-of-service.
No Permission Without Agreement. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using or accessing the Service.
Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy.
Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time you use the Service, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy in Section 1.1 (Effective Date) and review any changes since the last time you used the Service.
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Vintage Software reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting a new version on this page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately on posting. Unless Vintage Software obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.
Children's Privacy. Vintage Software does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If Vintage Software obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, Vintage Software will immediately delete that information from its database. Because Vintage Software does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, Vintage Software has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Vintage Software has designed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
Information Collection Practices.
Traffic Data. Like most website and mobile application operators, Vintage Software collects information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is not meant to personally identify you, although it may be possible to identify you using Traffic Data in combination with other data.
Cookie Policy. "Cookies" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service, or to store the user's preferences for that website. Vintage Software uses two types of Cookies: "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."
First Party Cookies. Vintage Software uses first-party Cookies on the Service for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and (2) to store your login credentials so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service. However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
Third Party Cookies and Advertising.
Ad Serving. Vintage Software uses third parties for providing advertising which helps financially support the Service.
Google Advertising. In addition to these purposes, Google, Inc. ("Google") uses third-party Cookies to serve online interest-based advertisements on EstateSales.NET. As an important example, Google uses a cookie known as "DoubleClick" to enable both Google and Google's third-party marketing partners to serve advertisements to you based on information gathered during your use of the Service or your visit to other websites and services.
Advertising on Third Party Websites. Vintage Software may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service. We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, may use first party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), third party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion tracking pixel), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting).
Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is Google's analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the "__ga" cookie. Vintage Software uses Google Analytics on the EstateSales.NET website and its other Services.
In addition to reporting website usage statistics, Google Analytics can also be used, together with other advertising cookies (including the cookies described in Section 4.2.3.2 (Google Advertising)), to help show more relevant ads on Google properties (like Google Search) and across the web.
Data Collection by Third Parties. Any of these third parties may place Cookies on your computer or mobile device, use web beacons (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon), and gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising.
Opting Out of Third Party Cookies.
You may customize your Google Cookies preferences or opt out of using Google Cookies on the Google Ads Settings page at https://www.google.com/settings/ads.
You may learn about Facebook Cookies and how to customize your preferences at https://www.facebook.com/about/ads.
You may opt out of using other third parties' Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at http://optout.networkadvertising.org. You can also learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at https://www.aboutcookies.org/.
