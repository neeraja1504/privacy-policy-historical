Information collected from Third Parties.
EvoLeads collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and EvoLeads subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When acquiring Third Party List Information, EvoLeads seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to EvoLeads and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
Information collected from Surveys.
EvoLeads collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an EvoLeads survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.)

Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to EvoLeads or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from EvoLeads or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to EvoLeads.
