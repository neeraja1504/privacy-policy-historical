How we process your data
Non-personally-identifying information
Like most website operators and processors, Event Smart collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Event Smart’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Event Smart’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Event Smart may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Aggregated Statistics
Event Smart may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Event Smart may monitor the most popular sites on the EventSmart.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Event Smart may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Event Smart does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Gathering and Protection of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Event Smart’s websites choose to interact with Event Smart in ways that require Event Smart to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Event Smart gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for services at EventSmart.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Event Smart – by purchasing – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Event Smart collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Event Smart. Event Smart does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Event Smart discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Event Smart’s behalf or to provide services available at Event Smart’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Event Smart’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Event Smart will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Event Smart discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Event Smart believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Event Smart, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user (including attendees) of an Event Smart website and have supplied your email address, Event Smart may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Event Smart and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Event Smart takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying information.
