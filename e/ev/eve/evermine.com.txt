Privacy and Security Policy | Evermine
We respect the privacy of our customers. The information you give us stays with us and goes no further; it is used only to communicate with you about your order and your experience with us. To assist you in ordering, we install cookies on your browser so that when you come back shopping with us from the same computer, we recognize you and can show you what you left in your cart on your last visit.
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies which help us improve our site and provide better services for you. You can find more information about Google's policies and how to opt out by visiting Google's privacy page.
After you place an order with us, we provide you the opportunity to review your experience on the independent review site Trustpilot. To facilitate this, an email is sent to you after your order is placed. You can choose whether to post a review on their site. Only with your consent is your email address retained by Trustpilot and will never be passed on to other parties.
We employ the most sophisticated software and hardware available to ensure your information is as safe as possible. We use state-of-the-art encryption and authentication tools including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. We also do not store any of your credit card information once your transaction is complete, so it cannot be retrieved after the transaction.
