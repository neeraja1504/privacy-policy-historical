You may also elect to provide us with access to your device contact lists or other social media contact lists. Since the app may not always know if you are the driver or a passenger, the app may record driving habits where you are not the driver.
We collect information in different ways.
We collect information directly from you. For example, we collect information from you if you use our website, request insurance information or register for our app. We also collect information if you contact us. You may have the option to share a picture of your driver’s license barcode which we will use to collect information about you from third-party providers. See the section below entitled, “We may share information with third parties” for more information.
We collect information from you passively. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. We do this on our websites and in emails that we send to you.

Learn more about these tools and how you can control them, here.
We also collect information from our mobile apps. This includes information about your device, including your device and app ID. If you have enabled location services for our app, we collect this information in the background, even when you do not have our app open on your phone.

We combine information. For example, we may combine information we get from a third party with information we already have. We may also combine information collected from you on our various platforms. We may also obtain information about you based on other websites you have visited.
We use information as disclosed and described here.

We use your information to calculate a driving score. If you use the app, we allow Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) to collect your driving habits as collected through the app and we display it in the form of a “driving score” in the app. We or CMT may also pass your driving habits as collected through the app to our business partners, who create a separate “risk score” based on their own proprietary algorithm. We or our business partners may use this risk score, together with your device’s ID and your state of residence that we provide to our business partners, to select offers of insurance products and services, which we may provide to you through the app. Since the app may not always know if you are driving or a passenger, your score may include trips where you are not the driver.
We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify you.
We may share information with third parties.
We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we share information with vendors who send emails for us.

Insurance companies that receive your information may use it to assist in providing you offers for insurance. You further acknowledge and agree that each insurance company that receives your quote request from this website or from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer reporting agency, which may include among other things, your driving record and/or credit score to determine eligibility and accurate rates. Additionally, if you use our app, the data provided to insurance companies, either directly by us or through other third parties, may include your driving history, “driving score” and “risk score” as calculated by us or other third parties, and as described above in the section above entitled “ We use your information to calculate a driving score. ” If you purchase insurance from any third party that is based in part on your driving habits provided by us or CMT, unless you instruct us otherwise, we or CMT may continue to provide your driving habits to this third party, who may share it with your insurance provider during the term of your policy.
We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. This may include information that is discoverable in connection with accident investigations, litigation or both. We may share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud.
