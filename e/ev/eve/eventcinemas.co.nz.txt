1               Summary of key points
This Privacy Policy applies to all EVENT Group businesses in Australia and New Zealand, including our cinemas, hotels, resorts, the State Theatre, the Thredbo Alpine Resort, and our Cinebuzz and Priority Guest Rewards loyalty programs.
We believe in being transparent about how we handle your Personal Information, so have summarised the key features of our Privacy Policy in this section.  Our full policy is set out in detail below.
Consent and opting-out
When you provide us with and consent to our use of your Personal Information (for example, by agreeing to our terms and conditions), you consent to our collection and use of your Personal Information (which is information about you which identifies you, or which can be used to reasonably identify you) in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. You can also opt-out from receiving any marketing communications from us or from our marketing partners, and from our use or disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes.
If you do not provide your consent, or if you withdraw your consent to our use of your Personal Information, it may mean we are unable to provide you with the same services, offers, or discounts that we would otherwise be able to provide.
What Personal Information we collect
The Personal Information we collect about you may include your name, contact details, and billing information, but may also include information about the goods and services you buy from us, and how you interact with us (for example, how you access and use our websites or mobile applications).
How we collect your Personal Information
We collect Personal Information about you directly from you or by your use of our websites or mobile applications, from public sources, and in some cases from third party ticketing and event organisations.
How we use your Personal Information
Our policy is to use your Personal Information to deliver our products and services to you, to improve our services, and to market products and services to you. In some cases, we share your Personal Information with third parties who perform these activities or do so on our behalf.
How and where we store your Personal Information
We take commercially reasonable steps to secure your Personal Information from unauthorised access, and to ensure the people we share your data with do the same.  Third parties to whom we send your data may be located in or operate data centres located in Australia, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Japan, The Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, or United States of America.

3               This Privacy Policy and your consent
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and handle your Personal Information in Australia and New Zealand.  Personal Information is information about you which identifies you or which can be used to reasonably identify you. When you consent to us using your Personal Information, you agree that we may use your Personal Information in accordance with this policy.  You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.
If you do not provide consent, or if you withdraw your consent to our use of your Personal Information, it may mean we are unable to provide you with the same services or the same level of service that we would otherwise be able to provide. For example, we may not be able to provide you with personalised recommendations, or with exclusive or discounted offers.
From time to time, there may be specific and additional privacy provisions that apply to our collection and use of your Personal Information.  For example, Personal Information provided when participating in a promotion, entering a competition, subscribing to a newsletter, or participating in a survey may be subject to a different privacy policy or contractual terms. If there is any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and those specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.

Cookie Information is useful to advertisers because it helps them understand their advertising audience, and to deliver advertising.

10.3        To whom do we disclose Cookie Information?
Examples of third parties that we may work with and disclose Cookie Information to include external companies and agencies that provide programmatic advertising services, specialist data companies, advertising platform providers, advertising servers, data partners, specialist data providers and social media operators such as Facebook.

11           Storage and security of your Personal Information
We generally store the Personal Information that we collect in electronic databases, some of which may be held on our behalf by third party data storage providers located in the countries identified in section 9 of this policy.
