6. How We Protect the Security of Personal Information
The security of your Personal Information is an important concern to us.
We take appropriate security measures that comply with Federal law to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access to or loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We implement generally accepted standards of technology security, including firewalls, to protect your Personal Information. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. Unfortunately, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that any information stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from unauthorized access and you agree not to hold us responsible for any breach of security. In addition, unencrypted e-mail is not a "secure" means of communicating with us, since e-mail may be intercepted by a third party in the course of its delivery.
7. Transfer of Personal Information Outside of Your Country of Residency
You acknowledge that we may need to host or store data outside of the United States. By providing any Personal Information to the Site, you consent to the hosting and storage of such information outside of the United States.
