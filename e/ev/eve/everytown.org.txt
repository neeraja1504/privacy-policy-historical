This Privacy Policy is offered by Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) to describe the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of our websites that link to this Privacy Policy (“Sites”) as well as for the personal information that we receive through other channels including by postal mail or in person.
Information Collection
When you visit our Sites or otherwise interact with us, we may collect certain personal information you choose to disclose to us, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and payment card information. You may provide this information, for example, when you send a donation, register with the Sites, make a purchase, or send a message on the Sites. If you register with the Sites, you may also be asked to create a user name and password. We may also receive information about you from third parties and combine it with the information that you provide.
When you interact with us, such as when you make a donation or provide your information through the Sites, your personal information, including your email, will automatically be added to our mailing list. Email addresses of recipients of tell-a-friend emails will not be collected by us.
If you apply for a job with us, we will collect any information that you provide during the application process, including your contact information, educational and work history, and demographic and other information that you submit about yourself.
We (or third parties as described below) may also collect technical information about your visit to our Sites, such as your domain name, IP address, browser type, activities on the Sites, and date and time of your visit.
Information Use
We may use the information we collect for any lawful purpose, such as to:

operate and improve the Sites, and customize your experience;
comply with applicable law;
identify or remedy potential threats to the Sites’ security;
conduct research about your use of the Sites and our services; and

Cookies
The Sites are cookie-enabled to give you a more customized user experience. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store on a computer and later use to recognize a user. A purpose of cookies is to enhance your ability to receive the information you want. We use two types of cookies to enhance the experience of users: session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when a user closes the browser in which this website was viewed. A persistent cookie expires on a pre-determined date. You may be able to personalize your browser settings to reject cookies, although certain features of the Sites may not function as intended. See below for more information and choices regarding analytics and interest-based advertising by third parties on the Sites.
Information Sharing
We may share personal information with our affiliates, such as parent or subsidiary organizations.
From time to time, we may send you information from or share your personal information with other non-affiliated organizations we think you might find interesting. When we share information with such organizations, it will be governed by their privacy policies. If you request that we keep your donation anonymous, we will not share personal information from that donation with non-affiliated organizations as described in this paragraph. Please see “Your Choices” below for more information on opting out.
We may share personal information with third parties who support our work, such as service providers, affiliates, and subsidiaries. This may include sharing information about your donations and purchases with third parties that provide marketing analytics services to us and to other entities based on the information that we provide. As a result of this sharing, such other entities will be able to send you more relevant offers if you already have a relationship with them. If you request that we keep your donation anonymous, we will not share personal information from that donation for marketing analytics as described in this paragraph. Please see “Your Choices” below for more information on opting out.
If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another organization, such as through a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, that organization will possess the information collected by us, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may disclose personal information or other data to comply with law or legal requirements, enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or protect our rights, property, or safety of our users or others.
We may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated, or any other technical information, without limitation.
Some parts of the Sites allow you to interact with other visitors or to participate in public forums. When you participate in these features, such as by commenting, the information that you provide will be available to other Site visitors and/or the general public.
