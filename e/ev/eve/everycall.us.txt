EveryCall.us Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
Terms of Service
The existence of a complaint is not indicative of any wrong doing by the company, individual, or companies at issue.  While users may indicate wrong doing on the part of an individual or company, EveryCall.us makes no presumptions of wrong doing.
1. Description of Service. EVERYCALL.US and Call Control are intended for PERSONAL USE through the use of a web browser or mobile phone application and any non-authorized commercial use is strictly prohibited.   EVERYCALL.US is a service for which users search for and post call comments about telephone calls they receive; Call Control is a service whereby users download a mobile application to their mobile phone to aide in controlling their privacy (the "Service"). You understand and agree that the Service may include content-targeted ads or other related information, as further described below and in the EVERYCALL.US Privacy Policy. In addition, you understand and agree that the Service is provided on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis.
