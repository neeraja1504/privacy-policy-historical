Privacy Policy - EverythingMom
Overview
EverythingMom considers the protection of personal privacy to be one of our most important values.  This privacy policy (” Policy “) gives you specific information on how we protect your privacy, how we treat personal information, and the choices you have.  This privacy policy is compliant with federal and provincial privacy laws including the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.   A summary of the ten principles of fair information practices is included at the end of this Privacy Statement.
This Policy applies to all web sites and services owned or provided by EverythingMom and its subsidiaries, which we refer to here collectively as “EverythingMom Sites”.  From time to time we may add new sites, domain names or services to those listed above.  Please note that this Policy applies only to sites owned and services maintained by EverythingMom or its corporate subsidiaries and not to web sites or services provided by other companies or organizations to which we link.
As a condition of using the EverythingMom Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy.  Additional terms and conditions which govern your use of the EverythingMom Sites are contained in our User Agreement, and, as applicable, in certain other service-specific license agreements or terms of use, which you will be notified of at the time of your registration for the applicable services.
The Policy is accessible through the EverythingMom Sites in several ways, including from a link entitled “Privacy” at the bottom of every EverythingMom.com page.  You acknowledge that this Policy may change over time.  If we make a material change to the terms of this Policy, we will give you 30 days notice of those changes (“Notice Period”) through reasonably prominent disclosure, including via email.  However, you should check the EverythingMom Sites (and EverythingMom.com in particular) regularly for these and other important announcements.  Your continued use of the EverythingMom Sites following the Notice Period will signify that you agree to these changes.
