U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor
Everbridge complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Everbridge has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Everbridge’s certification, please visit http://www/export.gov/safeharbor.
Note About Safe Harbor Invalidation: In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling which invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor Framework as the basis for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. We know that our customers trust and rely on us for the delivery of critical information to individuals globally, and therefore we have taken action to address the changes that have arisen around the transfer of personal data following the CJEU decision. Everbridge has implemented the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (also referred to as the Model Clauses) as part of a Data Processing Addendum which is pre-signed by Everbridge and provided through the “Everbridge Data Processing Addendum And Standard Contractual Clauses” link on the bottom of the homepage of www.everbridge.com. We further note that on February 2, 2016, the US and the European Union announced their agreement to a new framework referred to as the EU-US Privacy Shield. There is more to be done before the Privacy Shield framework can be implemented and therefore we will continue to monitor these developments and will provide updates on www.everbridge.com as they become available.
