EventRebels.com - The Online-Onsite Registration Company
EventRebels is committed to protecting the privacy of our users' personally identifiable information. To better protect the privacy of meeting or event registrants and of our clients (meeting planners), we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices users can make about the way their information is used at the site.
Information Collection and Use
Personally Identifiable Information
A. Registrants
Where registrants sign up to participate in an event, we collect certain personally identifiable information on behalf of the meeting planner to enable them to participate. The types of personally identifiable information we collect on behalf of the meeting planner may include: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, type and size of the business, and other similar demographic information.
Meeting planners may use this information for such purposes as to process your registration requests, to communicate with you about events that they are offering, for example, to send you invitations, confirmations, reminders and general information about events in which are or be may interested, as well as to enable you to manage your registration data (e.g., to enable you to register, update or cancel a reservation). EventRebels uses your personally identifiable information only to provide the meeting planners with the services they have contracted us for. EventRebels' privacy policy does not cover the meeting planner's use of your information. For more information on how your information is used by the meeting planner of an event for which you register, consult the individual privacy policy of your meeting planner.
In some instances, EventRebels may collect credit card information to enable users to sign up for meeting planners' events. Where we collect this information, we use it only for the purposes of processing registrants' requests.
EventRebels may use registrant information in the aggregate to help improve the content of our Web sites as well as to improve the products and services that we offer to both meeting planners and registrants.
B. Meeting Planners
To enable meeting planners to take full advantage of our offerings, we collect certain information when these users request information from our site. The types of personally identifiable information we collect may include: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and type of business.
