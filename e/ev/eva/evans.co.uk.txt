Privacy Policy
References in this Privacy Policy Statement to "we", "us" and "Evans" are to Evans Retail Limited (trading as Evans).
At Evans we are committed to maintaining your privacy. Our privacy policy statement is given below. If we make changes to this policy, we will notify you by updating this statement on our Website.
What information do we collect?
We ask for your name, telephone number, home address, email address and age for competitions, sweepstakes, or newsletter sign ups. When a purchase is made on our site, in addition to the above, we also ask for delivery address, and payment method details. We may obtain information about your usage of our Website to help us develop and improve it further through online surveys and other requests.
What the data will be used for?
Your data will enable us, and our processors, to fulfil your order, to notify you about important functionality changes and for statistical or survey purposes to improve this website and our services to you. We may also send you from time to time (by email or post) information about products and services and details of promotions and special offers from Evans. If you do not wish to be contacted for these purposes, we offer a range of ways in which you can inform us about your marketing preferences:
•  all email messages and email newsletters will contain information on how you can unsubscribe; or
•  email our customer services team by clicking here; writing "unsubscribe" in the subject heading; or
•  call our customer services team by using the relevant number shown in the "Contact Us" section; or
•  write to us at: Customer Services, Arcadia Group Limited, Colegrave House, 70 Berners Street, London W1T 3NL
In assessing your request for goods or services, we may use your information for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud.
What information do we share with others?
We may contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research, marketing and advertising services (including advertising on third party websites, social media networks and profiling) and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Evans. We may share your information with other Arcadia Group companies for internal business purposes (for example administering e-receipts or responding to customer queries). We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third party data processors located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area and to other Arcadia group companies in connection with the above purposes. Any such transfer of your personal data will be carried out in compliance with applicable laws and we will treat the information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy Statement. However, we will not pass your information on to any other Arcadia Group companies or other third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have agreed for us to do so.
One of the purposes for which we may disclose your address and postcode details is to check against the IMRG Security Alert or any other Fraud Prevention Scheme. We may also disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
