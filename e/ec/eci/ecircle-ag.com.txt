We are committed to meeting the digital marketing needs of our Clients, and to helping our Clients better engage with their customers on a personal level. We are also committed to the privacy of those customers, as well as visitors to the Site, and any other end users (collectively, “you” or “user”) who interact with our Services, in line with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws. We therefore adhere to the following data protection principles:

Confidentiality and integrity
Individual participation and access
We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information (or “Information”, “Data”) such as your name, phone number, email address, or mailing address. Please note that your use of the Services may also be subject to Mapp’s  Acceptable Use Policy , available here:  https://mapp.com/acceptable-use-policy/
PROVISIONING OF THE WEBSITE
Each time this Site and other web-based Services are accessed, our web servers automatically collect Information from the user’s system. This includes Information about the browser type and the version used, the operating system of the user’s terminal device, the Internet Service Provider of the user, the IP address of the user, date and time of access, and the previous website from which the user accesses our Site. Functional cookies may be placed on your computer or device to allow our Sites to remember you during your visit.
Processing this Information is necessary for Mapp to be able to provide an Internet presence and to ensure its security, and is therefore based on our “Legitimate Interest” to be “visible” to the market in accordance with Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR.
The above-mentioned Information will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of its collection. When storing data in the log file for security purposes, this is generally the case after no more than 7 days. Functional cookies will be deleted once your session ended.
CONTACTING MAPP
If you contact us via contact form, support ticket or e-mail, the Data you provide will be used to process your request. Your Contact Data may be transferred to our CRM system. The Data you provide is necessary for processing and answering your enquiry – we cannot answer your enquiry without providing it, or we can only answer it to a limited extent.
Mapp has the “Legitimate Interest” as per Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR to provide ways to be contacted and to process the Data transmitted in the course of sending a request. If the purpose of the request is to conclude a service contract or process a technical support request, the additional legal basis of the processing is “Performance of a Contract” in accordance with Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR.
When you contact us via the website form, request a demo, register for a webinar, contests or promotions, want to download content or register for and attend events, we will ask for your “opt-in” to be contacted by Mapp. Some offerings such as whitepapers or promotions are funded based on marketing use cases, i.e. you get something for “free” in exchange for the Personal Information needed by us to follow-up with you as a potential future Client. The processing of this Information is based on your “Consent” in accordance with Art. 6.1(a) of the GDPR.
Data processed in this context will be deleted when no longer necessary to achieve the original purpose and defined retention periods expired.
You have the possibility to object to the data processing or withdraw your consent at any time. The objection must be sent to our Data Protection Officer, preferably via the following email address:  privacy@mapp.com. In this case, all Personal Information stored in the course of establishing contact will be deleted unless there are any storage obligations to the contrary.
EMAIL MARKETING
We use our newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest news connected with our business- but only if you opted in to receive such newsletters. You will have to provide us with a valid email address and basic Personal Information for personalization purposes, including at least your first name, last name, and title. When you register for our newsletters, we will also store your IP address with a time stamp to be able to prove your registration in accordance with the Double Opt-In procedure. We also use so-called pixel tracking to collect certain events when marketing emails are sent (e.g. emails received; emails opened; clicks on links) to create aggregated statistics and reports on the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns.
Legal basis of the processing of your Information for email marketing is your “Consent” in accordance with Art. 6.1(a) of the GDPR. We do not send you newsletters unless you have affirmatively opted in to receive newsletters.
If you are an existing Client, based on our “Legitimate Interest” per Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR to advertise our products and to maintain a good relationship with you, you may receive marketing emails from us informing you about offerings related to Services you already purchased.
You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time using the link within the newsletter, or object to the data processing. The objection must be sent to our Data Protection Officer, preferably via the following email address:  privacy@mapp.com.
Marketing and email contacts, including newsletter recipients, are deleted when such users become inactive, click an “unsubscribe” button, or otherwise opt out of communications unless there are any storage obligations to the contrary.

ADVERITISING COOKIES
Mapp uses the Google Tag Manager (which does not have access to your Personal Information) to implement our own Mapp Acquire Cookie on our Site.

SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES (“FAN PAGES”)
We maintain publicly accessible profiles on the social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Xing and LinkedIn (‘social media pages’ or ‘fan pages’).
If you visit one of our social media pages when you are logged in to the respective social media network, the social media provider can analyze your usage behavior and associate the Information collected with your social media account, where it may also be enriched. Even if you are not logged in or if you do not have an account with the respective social media network, the social media provider may collect your Personal Information, such as your IP address or data generated by a cookie. The operators of social media platforms can use this Data to create user profiles. Your user profile can then be used to show you ads related to your interests on social media sites as well as other websites.
If you visit one of our social media pages, we share responsibility with the social media provider for the collection and processing of your Personal Information that takes place on that platform. With regard to information about the collection and processing of your Data on such platforms, we refer you to the privacy policies published by the respective social media networks. We do not have any additional information available. The privacy policies of the various social media networks can be found on the following pages:

You are able to assert your rights under Chapter 3 of the GDPR (right to information, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, etc.) both against us and against the relevant social media provider. In this context and with regard to our social media pages, we would like to point out that we can only control the processing of Personal Information and the implementation of Data Subjects’ rights within the scope of the options presented to us by the respective provider.
The legal basis for our use of social media pages is our “Legitimate Interest” according to Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR to run marketing of our events and Services on the Internet.
REGISTERED CLOUD SERVICE USERS
Mapp is a marketing technology provider and offers Cloud Services to its Clients which are the controllers of their own marketing contacts’ Personal Information. Mapp is therefore the Processor of this Personal Information; the processing is governed by a Data Processing Agreement between Mapp and its Client and not within the scope of this Privacy Policy. Mapp however remains Controller of those Personal Information related to the registration, login and usage of our Cloud Services by system users.
During the registration process basic user profile data is collected including the user’s name, business email address (used as user identifier), password (stored in hashed format), and permissions. During login you’ll be required to provide your business email address and your password. While you’re using the system, we create logs of your actions including what you accessed, from which IP address and at which time. To better understand how you use our products and to continuously improve our product offerings, we may use additional analytic tools. Additional Data may be shared when you use technical integrations of Mapp Cloud with other solutions. When you are a registered user of one of our Cloud Services, we may automatically register you in our support system, which simplifies the process for you to contact our technical support team. Furthermore, we use relevant Information for billing purposes. Without a registered user account, you cannot use our Cloud Services.
The legal basis for the processing is the “Performance of a Contract” (Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR). The processing of any Personal Information serves the provision, maintenance and improvement of our software services, as well as the security.
The above-mentioned Data will be deleted after they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected, generally upon the expiration of the underlying service contract, considering retention periods under tax and commercial law.
APPLYING FOR A JOB AT MAPP
Embedded into this Site, you’ll find our online application tool which allows you to apply for a job at Mapp.
We process the Personal Information you have sent us in connection with your application in order to assess your suitability for the position (or any other open positions in our company) and to complete the application process. Once you received and accepted an offer from Mapp, a background verification process will be initiated, which is necessary due to market requirements. Goals of the background verification check are to verify your identity and criminal record clearance, and to confirm claimed qualifications and employments within the last 5 years (as far as relevant). Candidates for financial roles may also be subject to a credit review.
The processing of your Personal Information in this application procedure is necessary for the establishment of an employment relationship, i.e. we can only hire you when you provide the Personal Information we need. Legal basis for the processing of Applicant Data is therefore “Performance of a Contract” as per Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR. Should the Data be necessary for legal prosecution after completion of the application procedure, further processing will be based on our “Legitimate Interest” in the assertion or defense of claims as per Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR.
In the event of rejection, your Applicant Data will be deleted 6 months after the assignment of the respective position unless you agreed on further storage in our applicant data pool and consideration for open positions in the future. These Data will be checked annually to see whether there is a need for further storage; otherwise the Data will be deleted. If you have been awarded a position as part of the application process, the data will be transferred from the applicant data system to our personnel information system.
Your Applicant Data will be viewed by the personnel department after receipt of your application. Suitable applications will then be forwarded internally to the department managers responsible for the respective open position. The rest of the process is then coordinated. Within Mapp, only those persons have access to your Personal Information who need it for the proper course of our application procedure. Furthermore, we use specialized service providers for the application process which may involve the processing of your Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
RECIPIENTS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Where appropriate, we may share your Personal Information with various recipients, including the following categories:
Our third-party service providers who process Personal Information on our behalf for IT and system administration and hosting, billing, research and analysis, marketing, customer support and other purposes (e.g. data centers, SaaS applications)
Affiliates within our group of companies that process Personal Information for, amongst others, customer service, marketing purposes, technical operations and account management
Sponsors of events, webinars and contests for which you have registered
Public and regulatory authorities, where we are required to disclose Personal Data in order to comply with our legal obligations
PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Mapp applies effective security safeguards to protect your Personal Information and therefore complies with and is partly certified against ISO 27001.
ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management and defines the requirements for the introduction, operation, monitoring, and continual improvement of an effective information security management system (ISMS). It systematically ensures that an organization implements and maintains commercially reasonable and industry standard technical and organizational safeguards to preserve the security of (Personal) Information.
Though we do everything we can to prevent a security breach from happening, there are no guarantees. In the case we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps, by posting a notice on the Site if a security and/or sending an email to you at the email address you have previously provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, you should notify us.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide Information to us, we might transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. To ensure the safety of this transfer and the compliance with the applicable European data law, we utilize Standard Contractual Clauses, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (if applicable) and express consents (Data Transfer Agreements) in relation to Personal Information originating the European Union or the United States.

YOUR RIGHTS AND HANDLING OF COMPLAINTS
EU Citizens
If Personal Information about you is processed, you are the Data Subject in the sense of the GDPR. Therefore, you are entitled to the following rights against us as Controller: Right to information, right to rectification, right to limitation of processing, right to deletion, right to data transferability, right of appeal, right to revoke the declaration of consent under data protection law. Some data processing procedures are only possible with your express consent.

Once you have exercised your right to object, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes unless the Controller is able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or if such processing serves to lodge, action or defend a legal claim. If the processing is carried out for the purposes of direct marketing, you may exercise the right to object to this at any time (Art. 21.2 GDPR), and your Personal Information will then no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes.
