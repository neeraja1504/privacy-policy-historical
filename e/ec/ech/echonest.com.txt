About Our Online Personalization and Data Services
We do not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”). PII is information that can be used to contact or identify a natural person. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to: name, email address, postal address, telephone number, social security number, and credit card number.
The Echo Nest analyzes non-PII activity data for our customers and partners to enable personalized music recommendations and actionable insights to improve the performance of our customers’ and partners’ music services and also advertising campaigns, including targeting ads. All of this data is anonymous, meaning that we do not associate it with personally-identifiable information.
The Non-Personal Information We Collect
Our partners and customers collect information for our ad targeting services through the use of common internet technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, on the web sites or devices or in web widgets or other embedded functions. Cookies are small text files that can be used by a web site to store information on a users' machine and later retrieve it. Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or service providers. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

While we have taken commercially reasonable efforts to guard information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.
Non-PII data collected by The Echo Nest for ad targeting purposes is generally retained indefinitely or for a shorter period as stipulated by the agreements we have with our customers.

Our partners that are online music services may have their own mechanisms for opting out from our anonymous data collection for use in our ad targeting services.
