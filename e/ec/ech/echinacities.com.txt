Username and password security
We use a variety of safeguards to protect the personal information we receive and store, and take appropriate measures to secure your data from loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. The security of your username and password is, however, your responsibility. It is up to you to keep them secret.
Sharing your resume
Any resume you create on eChinacities.com is stored on our database in the United States or China. You can control the visibility of your resume by setting it to “Visible”, “Limited” or “Private”.
“Visible” resumes can be viewed in their entirety by any employer or recruiter paying to use our database. We cannot control how resumes are used by these third parties. “Limited” resumes will keep your contact details private, with employers and recruiters only able to send you an invitation to connect via the website.“Private” resumes will not be visible on the database, but basic information we acquired about you from a public website may be. If you apply for a job while your resume is set to private, the relevant employer will receive a copy of your resume and may retain it. Once your resume has been received by an employer, we cannot retrieve it or control how it is used.
If your resume contains the personal data of references, you must ensure that person has given you written permission to share their details.
The resumes you upload to eChinacities must not contain sensitive information regarding your:
Race
Ethnic origin
Political beliefs
Philosophical or religious beliefs
Membership to trade unions or political parties
Physical or mental health
Biometric details or genetic makeup
Addictions or sexual life
The commission of crime or objectionable behaviour and associated penalties and fines
Your social security, ID or national insurance number
If you do give us any of these details you agree to do so at your own risk.
Storage of your personal information
In order to streamline our services, we retain all of the information we gather about you until you change or remove your personal information. We may retain your information for as long as your account is active in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and provide our services.
If you are located in the European Union and do not use your account or interact with our services for more than five years, your profile will expire and be scheduled for removal from the site. If you have uploaded a resume to your account, you will receive an email from us before we delete it.
Who we share your information with
By using eChinacities.com services, you are consenting to the disclosure of your information to any employer you apply to, show interest in or message. That employer is free to contact you for employment-related purposes, either via the website or via contact details you provide. We will also share you information with employers when you apply for a job or make your resume searchable, and with other third parties when required by law to do so.
Third parties
Depending on how you organise your privacy settings, your resume and profile database may be visible to third parties, who can see the information you post. This information can be accessed, stored and used by those in countries that may not have the same data protection legislation as your country of residence. eChinacities.com is not responsible for how third parties use the information you give to us. You should therefore set your resume to “Private” if this is a concern and only post information elsewhere that you are happy to be made public. While we attempt to limit access of our database to legitimate users, we cannot guarantee other parties will not gain access.
We may use the information you supply us with to determine whether you might be interested in the products and services of selected third parties. We may show you targeted ads based on your information and preferences on the website and information acquired from third parties, such as other public websites and data providers. You can edit which notifications you receive in your account settings
We will only disclose your information to third parties when you give your consent for us to do so, either by making your resume searchable (“Visible” or “Limited”), after which it can be accessed by selected employers/recruiters, or by opting in to receiving information about products and services from third parties.
We may share aggregated information about our customers with third parties in order to serve you adverts, but such aggregated data, including location, schooling and experience level, will not identify users individually. If we create a co-branded website with another company, the information collected on that site will be subject to the privacy policies of both companies.
If a third party acquires any or all of eChinacities.com’s business units, we may disclose and transfer your personal information to them. If eChinacities.com becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, your information will be disposed of in a manner approved by the court. You will be notified of insolvency proceedings and any sale or merger to a third party by email and/or a prominent notice on the website.
We will disclose your information if required to do so by a government authority if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to meet legal requirements or comply with legal process, protect the rights and/or property of eChinacities.com, investigate and prevent illegal activities or protect the safety of users and the public.
