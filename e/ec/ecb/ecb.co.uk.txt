Updating and correcting information
You may update or correct your personal information online in relevant membership areas or by contacting us in writing or by email (see the section ‘ How to contact us ’ below). Please include your name, address and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes.
If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.
Your rights
You have a number of legal rights in respect of your personal data.  These include:
The right to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. The same right applies to any other person whose personal data you provide to us.  We will require proof of identity and proof of authority if the request comes from someone other than the person whose data we are asked to provide.  This will ensure we only provide information to the correct person.  We normally expect to respond to requests within 28 days of receiving them.
withdraw consent to direct marketing. You can exercise this right at any time and can update your preferences yourself or ask us to do it for you.  See section ‘ Updating and correcting your personal data ’ above for details.
withdraw consent to other processing. Where the only legal basis for our processing your personal data is that we have your consent to do so, you may withdraw your consent to that processing at any time and we will have to stop processing your personal data.  Please note, this will only affect a new activity and does not mean that processing carried out before you withdrew your consent is unlawful.
If you consider any of your personal data is inaccurate, you can correct it yourself or ask us to do it for you (see section ‘ Updating and correcting your personal data ’ above for details).
In limited circumstances you may be able to require us to restrict our processing of your personal data.  For example, if you consider what we hold is inaccurate and we disagree, the processing may be restricted until the accuracy has been verified
In some circumstances, for example, where we have no legal basis for retaining your personal data, you may be entitled to require us to delete your personal data
Where our processing is based on it being in our legitimate interests, your rights and freedoms, based of your particular situation, may enable you to object to our processing
Where you have provided personal data to us electronically, you may be entitled to require us to provide that data to you electronically or to transmit it to another organisation.
