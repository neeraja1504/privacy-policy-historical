Privacy | ECMWF
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) takes great care to protect personally identifiable information of all data subjects with whom ECMWF interacts.
Throughout 2018 and 2019, ECMWF has been implementing all elements of ECMWF's Policy on Personally Identifiable Information Protection (PIIP) that aims to ensure an adequate level of protection relative to the European Union’s standards reflected in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While these standards do not directly apply to ECMWF, an inter-governmental organisation, ECMWF has chosen to provide, as controller or processor, similar and appropriate safeguards through its PIIP.  The PIIP is available to download.
