We are the “controller” of the personal information you provide to us.

What personal information we collect and why
Personal information is any information which identifies you personally, whether directly (for example, your name) or indirectly (for example, information about your use of our service).
We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletters, respond to one of our surveys, or fill out a form.
When registering your details or making a booking for a service through our website or by completing a form, we may collect the following from you:
Your name: This allows us to refer to you when speaking to you and to address any post we may need to send to you specifically.
Your telephone number: This is needed to enable us to communicate with you. For example, we may need to call you back regarding a booking, or if we get disconnected from you. We may also call you in response to your expressed interest in EC, but will only do so if you tell us that you’re happy to be contacted in such a way.
Your mailing address: We need your address to communicate with you and, when required, to send you information and documents related to your booking.
Your email address: The email address you provide may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your booking, and/or to occasionally send you company news, updates, or related product or service information.
Your country of residence, country of birth, nationality, passport number and passport expiry date: We need to know these details to help you with visa-related issues concerning your booking.
Your date of birth: We need to know your date of birth to ensure you are placed in the right age-level course and/or accommodation.
Your gender: We need to know your gender to ensure we place you in the appropriate accommodation.
Your current level of English language proficiency : This information helps us tailor the services we may offer to you and to help track your learning with us.
Your credit card information: We need to know your credit card information to pay for services provided by us and to complete your booking if you are booking directly with us.
Information about any needs you may have for additional assistance (which may include information concerning your health and any medical conditions you may have): We may ask whether you have any needs for additional assistance that you would like us to take into account. This will help us tailor our services to you. For example, if you tell us that you have impaired mobility, we can ensure you are placed in accommodation that meets your needs. You don’t have to provide this information to us, and, if you choose not to, it won’t prevent us from providing our services to you (we may, however, be unable to provide any additional assistance).
Your academic results : When you study with us we will record and use your academic results to help us monitor your progress and set appropriate work in class and outside the classroom.
Emergency contact details. We need you to provide contact details for certain persons you have a close relationship to (for instance, your parents, spouse, partner, close friend or family member). We would only use this information in the event of an emergency situation involving you. By providing this information, you agree that you have informed the relevant person(s) of the provision of their contact details to us, and that they are happy for you to do so.
As part of providing our services to you, we may also collect the following information about you:
Performance record : We collect and use details of your performance during our programmes to help track your learning progress and to better tailor the future provision of our services to you.

Monitor your academic progress, provide you with feedback on this and customise your class work and work outside the classroom.

Where we rely on this legal ground for handling your personal information, we consider whether our interests as an organisation are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

You may request further information from us concerning the process we have followed here.
You have the right to object to the decision we have arrived at. Please see Your rights below.
Where we think there is a risk that one of your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms may be affected, we will not use your personal information unless we have obtained your consent to using it in that way.
For compliance with our legal obligations
If asked, and if obligated and authorised to do so by law, we share your personal information with law enforcement agencies, regulators, courts or other public authorities.
For performance of our contract with you
Aside from the information noted above that we use on the basis of our legitimate purposes and to comply with our legal obligations, we use the information we collect as part of our booking process to assist in entering into a contract with you to provide our services.

Following these periods, we will stop using the relevant information and it will either be anonymised or deleted to the extent it is technically feasible to do so.
In certain limited circumstances we may be required to retain your personal information for longer. When determining whether this is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was provided, we take into account factors including:
The sensitivity of the personal data we are holding and business risks we face if we delete or anonymise the data.
