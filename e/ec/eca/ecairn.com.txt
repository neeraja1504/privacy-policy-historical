eCairn builds a list of the best people for our client to talk to,
eCairn provides a report on this audience (how many they are, what they talk about …)
along with trending topics of the day/week.
eCairn then highlights public posts from the audience that the user should be aware of and engage with.
How is this web public data indexed?
As part of its collection activity, eCairn uses automated indexing systems, also known as “crawlers”. Our crawlers are identifiable and site owners can opt to block them or contact us with more information.
They can do so by contacting us directly or by filing an abuse report with AWS.
eCairn maintains a list of websites who have explicitly opted for not been crawled and we stop crawling web sites and remove the data within 48 hours after notification,
