DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent unless required or permitted by applicable law. We will not rent, sell, loan, or otherwise market your Personal Information to any third party. There are some situations in which we may disclose your Personal Information without your consent. For example:
when we are required or authorized by law to do so, for example if a court issues a subpoena
when the services we are providing to you require us to give your information to a third party your consent will be implied, unless you tell us otherwise
when we believe we need to disclose information to protect our rights, or the rights of others, property, or to enforce this Privacy Policy or the terms and conditions of the ECW PRESS website, including where it is necessary to establish or collect amounts owed to us
if the information is public record information specified by regulation and the disclosure is directly related to the purposes for which it was recorded on the public record
We may transfer your personal information to service providers who are performing services on our behalf. These service providers will be obligated to treat your personal information in accordance with the requirements of this Privacy Policy.
Occasionally, we may use service providers located outside of Canada to process and/or store Personal Information for us. Please note that Personal Information in the custody of these service providers may be subject to access by the law enforcement authorities of those jurisdictions in which the service providers are located.

In the event that our company undergoes a fundamental change such as a sale of assets, or a merger with another company or enterprise, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Information to the prospective counterparties to the transaction and their professional advisors. No such disclosure will occur unless these entities have executed confidentiality agreements in respect of your Personal Information and limit their use of it to the purposes necessary for completing the transaction and the operation of the business after the transaction is complete.

When you provide us with your Personal Information, you agree that you are providing us your implied consent to collect and use your Personal Information to fulfill the requested order, service, or information.
