3. What are Cookies?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser's help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Ecommerce to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to
minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Ecommerce to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
Some of our business partners (e.g., HumanClick) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by HumanClick (Domain: server.iad.liverperson.net, our Live Chat application) only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Ecommerce may use the personally identifiable information collected by Ecommerce to contact customers regarding products and services offered by Ecommerce and, to the extent the user has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.

In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Ecommerce and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.
We use various credit card processing companies to bill you for our services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
