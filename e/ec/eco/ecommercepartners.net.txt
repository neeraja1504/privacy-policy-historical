Privacy | ECommerce
As a full service promotions and sweepstakes agency, ECommerce Partners operates Promotions on behalf of its clients. As part of those services, ECommerce Partners collects personally identifiable information for its clients by use of ECommerce Partners' proprietary online technology, ECommerce Partners mailboxes, and points of entry offline. ECommerce Partners collects such personally identifiable information solely for the use of its clients and the operation of the Promotions. ECommerce Partners does not use any of the data collected itself, other than to notify potential winners and for prize fulfillment purposes in connection with a Promotion.
ECommerce Partners does not consolidate data across different clients' Promotions, does not maintain data beyond the conclusion of client Promotions (other than for back-up purposes on its client's behalf), and does not "monetize" data collected on behalf of its clients in any manner whatsoever. ECommerce Partners strictly limits access to all personally identifiable information within its organization, and data is never shared outside of the company for any reason whatsoever (with, of course, the exception of appropriate governmental or legal requests). Personally identifiable information collected from different client Promotions is never mingled or shared with anyone other than the client on whose behalf the information was collected. Personally identifiable information collected by ECommerce Partners on behalf of a client belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client's Privacy Policy.
An individual's desire to "opt-out" of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with a particular client's Privacy Policy. ECommerce Partners requires its clients, by contract, to use the data which ECommerce Partners collects on its behalf in accordance with generally accepted privacy standards for both offline and online data, which includes an "opt-out" method for individuals who have provided personally identifiable information. Ultimately, however, ECommerce Partners is not responsible for data collected on behalf of its clients when such data is in its client's possession. Where ECommerce Partners operates one Promotion on behalf of multiple clients, the use of the personally identifiable information by all of the companies involved will be clearly outlined by a Privacy Policy created for that Promotion.
ECommerce Partners "Opt-in" to Client Promotions: From time to time, ECommerce Partners and one of its clients will agree to allow ECommerce Partners to offer entrants to a Promotion an opportunity to "opt-in" to receiving marketing information from ECommerce Partners and its partners. In such cases, on the Promotion registration page, an ECommerce Partners "opt-in" question will appear clearly explaining to potential entrants that by checking the box they will be agreeing to share their personally identifiable information with ECommerce Partners. If there is not an ECommerce Partners "opt-in" question on the registration form, ECommerce Partners will not share or use any of the data collected whatsoever. When individuals "opt-in" to receive information from ECommerce Partners, they are agreeing to receive email and other notices from ECommerce Partners, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other Promotions. Such notices may come from ECommerce Partners itself, companies with whom ECommerce Partners has a business relationship and/or ECommerce Partners clients.
Opting Out If you want to "opt-out" of receiving such notices from ECommerce Partners after you have "opted-in", or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ECommerce Partners, you may do so in one of two (2) ways:
Please send email to remove[at]ECommercePartners.net. Please make sure to include the name of the promotion in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.

ECommerce Partners Promotions: ECommerce Partners also runs Promotions on its own behalf. Such Promotions are to generate interest from other businesses in ECommerce Partners' products and services. ECommerce Partners uses the personally identifiable information collected in such Promotions as sales leads and may contact the individual registrants by email, mail or phone to discuss the registrant's interest in retaining ECommerce Partners. ECommerce Partners will never sell such information, share it with another business, or use it for any purpose other than marketing ECommerce Partners own core business. If you want to "opt-out" of being contacted by ECommerce Partners after you have participated in one of its Promotions, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ECommerce Partners, you may do so in one of two (2) ways:

ECommerce Partners' Online Promotion Technology: ECommerce Partners' proprietary Promotion technology has the ability to collect data other than personally identifiable information for any of the three (3) kinds of Promotions it operates online. ECommerce Partners may collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. ECommerce Partners may collect information about the site you last visited prior to the Promotion or about your activity during your visit to the Promotion site. This information will not reveal your personal identity (it is anonymous), may be used by ECommerce Partners to administer the technical and operational aspects of this site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. ECommerce Partners may use a cookie, a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user, to assist in performing some or all of these activities and also to limit your ability to play a Promotion more times than allowed. You can set your browser to accept all, some, or no cookies. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access some, or all aspects of a particular Promotion.
Special Note about Children: Unless otherwise specifically indicated, ECommerce Partners Promotions are not available to anyone under the age of thirteen (13). ECommerce Partners does, however, operate some Promotions on behalf of its clients which collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In each such instance, ECommerce Partners and its clients comply fully with all aspects of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") in the operation of the Promotion, in the collection of the information itself and in the subsequent use of the data collected. Personally identifiable information will not be collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent in compliance with the COPPA guidelines.
Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83): A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
