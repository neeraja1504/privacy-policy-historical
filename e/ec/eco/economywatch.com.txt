Use of cookies
Economy Watch uses "cookies", where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
Like many web site operators, EconomyWatch.com uses Google Analytics to track usage of our website, including:

Search terms used to access the sites
This aggregate, non-personal information is collated by Google and provided to EconomyWatch.
All pages on Economy Watch are coded with software provided by Google. This is transparent to the user as the software makes use of a simple Javascript code at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique identifier. This enables Google Analytics to track the number of unique visitors to our web sites. This information is collected and aggregated by Google, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. EconomyCloud do not and will not marry any data collected by Nielsen//NetRatings with any personal information collected on EconomyCloud web sites.
